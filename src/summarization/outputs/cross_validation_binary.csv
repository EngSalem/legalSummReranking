2003skqb487.txt,"At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support. HELD: Interim custody was given to the petitioner with access to the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month. On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo.","At issue on this application is the interim custody of the child of the parties. Since the parties ceased to cohabit, the child has resided with the petitioner and the respondent. The respondent has had access. The petitioner herself admits that the parties had an arrangement from the outset whereby the parties would'switch the child back and forth every second day.' Notwithstanding the instances of suspended access, the arrangements for access appear to have worked relatively well and appear to be in the petitioner's best interests. HELD: 1)Interim custody is granted on an interim basis. The child has and does reside with the respondent with access and visitation arrangements to the petitioner. There is plenty of affidavit evidence that both parties are loving parents to their child. The mutual love and acceptance demonstrated by the families and relatives of each party is self-evident and commendable. The court must take into account the current status quo, namely that the child is doing well and has a loving, stable relationship with her mother, the petitioner has provided suitable care and has met Keanna's needs. Notwithstanding the frequent disputes between the parties, the court finds that the respondent made no attempts to gain custody until he was served with the application. 2)The court takes into consideration the current situation in which the child resides with the mother and the petitioner, with access, visitation arrangements and costs."
2_2012nssc10.txt,"Rule 77.03 – Liability for costsThe court found in favor of the respondents after a half-day chambers hearing. They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim. Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two. This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing. While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs. The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner.","The Bowsers were successful as Respondents in Chambers application which was heard for full day and half day on October 18 and October 20, 2011. The Sheas, by omitting some important information in making their claim, undermined the strength of their claim. This was not one of those rare cases where solicitor client costs should be awarded. Rule 77.01(1)(a) and 77.02(1) of the Rules make it clear that the winning party in the litigation is presumptively entitled to partial compensation of their expenses of litigation. Customarily this has been viewed as substantial, but not complete indemnification of their costs of litigation, as in many other cases, the dispute concerns to what extent there should be partial compensation. Tariff “C” is the appropriate guideline. The Bowsers requested declaration that there were entitled to right-of-way across the land of the Bowsers and were seeking mandatory injunction and permanent injunction as well as damages for the loss of use and enjoyment of their properties. This should not be seen as outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible conduct. Ultimately, the Sheas erred in undermining their claim and undermined their strength of the claim."

2007nspc30.txt,"Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction. The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground. The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib. The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence. Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge. The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault. The accused claimed self-defence and that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt any or all of the charges against him, being that of aggravated assault, by wounding, by using or threatening to use a weapon, and that of possessing a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace. HELD: The Court found that the accused committed an assault without justification or provocation. Even if S.41(2) is not applicable, the accused was under no imminent danger and there was no need to move toward the accused and strike him to defend himself."
b_1996canlii7148.txt,"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident. The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued. An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.","This was a claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased motor vehicle arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff claimed for reimbursement of the $503.73 deducted for depreciation. The insurer argued that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. HELD: The plaintiff brought this action pursuant to s. 39 of the Act. The action was dismissed for reimbursement. 1)SGI elected not to reinstate the motor vehicle. 2)The plaintiff was not aware of the 20% deduction for depreciation until he attended to the repair shop to pick up the vehicle. The repairs were complete at that time. The roving appraiser appraised the damage, provided an appraisal which included the deduction of depreciation and advised Crestview. 3)The insurer was not required to pay the plaintiff for the repairs. 4)The statutory scheme is quite clear. An election under the Motor Vehicle Act is an election under which the insurer is bound to reinstitute. In this case, the insurer elected to pay for the entire repair of the vehicle without the knowledge or involvement of the insured. The insurance policy having in effect become contract to repair the insurer's liability for the damage is a measurement of the plaintiff benefit and the defendant's obligation. However, the clarity of this scheme is clouded by a statutory condition which adds an additional element to the statutory limits placed on the insurer by its conduct."
d_2006skqb251.txt,"Hayley is 7 years old. In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her. The father seeks sole custody. The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests. The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access.","The father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over their seven-year-old daughter. The father petitions for sole custody while each of the mother and grandmother independently seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: The Court found that the father’s position in the family was not supported by the evidence at trial. The court ordered that the child be placed in the custody of the father and that the mother should be designated solely by the father as her primary caregriver. The child was to spend the next four years living with her father and attending school with her mother. The Court ordered that all child support be awarded to the father in the amount of $250 per month until the child had completed high school."

The Court raised jurisdiction, service and time issues.HELD: 1)To avoid adjournment counsel consented to the court's jurisdiction, the acknowledgement of service and the abridgement of time. 2)The mother was found to be in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the order by repeatedly refusing, without lawful excuse, to comply with its terms. Almost without exception she refused to make the child available for the bi-weekly supervised access visits. She did not abduct the child. The mother was to purge her contempt by paying the father's solicitor and client costs respecting the two applications fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order. The August 15, 2002 order was vacated. 3)The father was to have unsupervised access on alternate weekends. He may bring the child to Saskatchewan but shall not remove her from this province or Manitoba without the mother's written consent.

HELD: 1) The respondent is found to be in contempt and is ordered to purge her contempt by paying the solicitor and client costs fixed at $1,500 and by obeying access terms of this order.  2) The father seeks a fine and an order that the respondent bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. She seeks to restrict access visits to supervised visits in Brandon, Manitoba.  3) The limited access proposal of the respondent is not realistic because it virtually guarantees that the petitioner and his parents will never be able to develop any relationship with his son, child that he has been supporting financially on a voluntary basis since birth. Nor is the access proposal realistic because the respondent does not have the financial ability to bring his child to Saskatchewan for access. Access need not be supervised. Access must not be disturbed. Access is supervised. The petitioner shall have access to the child on alternate week-ends and shall be entitled to an allowance of $60 per month as a partial reimbursement of those costs.

HELD: 1)The matrimonial property was valued and divided equally. The wife was permitted to register a caveat to protect the value of her 1/2 interest. If the husband did not arrange payment by September 1st next, the wife was given leave to apply for a sale. 2)The wife was given custody of the 2 children of the marriage.  The court ordered specific access for the husband. 3)The court confirmed the interim support orders made before trial in the amounts of $400.00 per month for the wife, $400.00 per month for the oldest child, and $800.00 per month for the youngest child, who was handicapped.","The issues raised in this action is custody and access, child and spousal support and division of matrimonial property.

HELD: 1)The court ordered that the respondent pay the petitioner for her support and interest at the same rate as in the interim order. If the sum of $50,711.66 is not paid by the petitioner by September 1st next, Jeanette may apply to the court for a sale of the lands to facilitate payment of the amount then outstanding. 2)The petitioner had a beneficial interest created by this order sufficient to support registration of a caveat in the following lands to the extent of $70,000. There was no basis upon which it could be reduced below $400 monthly. Medication for her diabetes alone costs her up to $200 every month. The furniture and personal effects mitigates against a change in amount that is being paid for her. The evidence does not allow for lessening of the monthly payment of $300 for Mark. 3)The respondent was ordered to pay $800 for the children's school supplies and $400 for their cabin belongings. 4)Terrance agreed to pay the respondent $1,600 per month. 5)The parties agreed on the value of the respondent's assets.

The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content. The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content. In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany. When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation. HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality. The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff. There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff. The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company. The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs.","The plaintiff, certified organic farmer, sold organic oats to the defendant who in turn sold the oats through a broker in Ontario to the ultimate destination being a miller in Germany.

d_2013skca22.txt,"The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable. The prospective appellant failed to establish that there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings or to the field of practice, the state of law or the administration of justice to warrant a determination by the Court.","The appellant seeks leave to appeal an order of Gabrielson J. in Chambers dated December 11, 2012. The Chambers judge was acting in his capacity as an Administrative Judge appointed pursuant to the Court Administration Protocol (the CAP) established as part of the settlement of the Indian Residential Schools litigation. The appellant argues this was a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process meets its overall objective of determining if the amount of the appellant's fee is reasonable and equitable. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. 1) The appellant fails to establish there is a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings before the Court, or to the field of practice or the administration of justice generally, to warrant a determination by the Court of Appeal. 2) The order appealed from was simply a procedural order that was designed to allow the appellant to pay the disputed account of non-party relating to matters wholly unconnected to the action. The order is discretionary in nature and each of the grounds of MLG is bound to fail. An appeal will unduly delay the proceedings and will unnecessarily add to the cost of proceedings. 3) There was no issue of importance requiring the attention of the Court on the issue of the evidence or information upon which the Administrative Judge relied. Both parties relied on hearsay evidence and an application for directions is simply an informal procedural step to ensure the Verification process moves along. There are no issues of importance required to be considered in leave applications as articulated in Rothmans, Benson Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan, 2002 SKQB 119. 4) The appeal of the order appealed was denied. 5) There were several court judgments dealing with the dispute between ESI and the appellant over the accounts from previous work done by ESI for MLG. The Administrative Judge directed the parties to determine how verification could be completed without breaching solicitor client privilege. He made no error when he said the parties were agreed on a common database because that is exactly what MLG requested in its Prayer for Relief. MLG was ordered to supply the redacted electronic billing records as whole from the 'live data' for the residential schools litigation. MLG had been using ESI software for its own electronic billing program. MLG did not comply with its obligations under the VA. MLG produced 1,270 page hardcopy list of the 57,468 time entries to be deleted or changed which Canada estimated to approximate $4 million in unwarranted time.

9_1999canlii2477.txt,"The appellants motion to strike the respondent's statement of claim was dismissed on the ground that questions of law are not matters to be brought before the court on an application to strike. The Chambers judge also accepted the respondent's submission that the extent of the immunity of administrative boards and their members from actions such as this based on their alleged malice and bad faith is, as yet, unclear in Canada. Allowing the appeal in part, that the Chambers judge erred when he concluded that all questions of law, including questions where the law is clear, should not be brought before the court in an application to strike, when he concluded that the constitutional question posed by the respondent had not yet been answered by the courts, and when he determined that the extent of the immunity of the appellant Board and its members, except for the Chair, was unclear.

The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the appeal should be allowed on three grounds: the application was not made promptly or in time; (delay in bringing the application to strike, is obviously not an issue in this case). The issue of whether the respondent, in laying the information, was cloaked with Crown immunity, was unclear, in law (the foundation of Justice Hart’s decision). The constitutional question posed by the respondents has not yet been clearly answered by the courts. The desirability of maintaining supervisory jurisdiction over administrative tribunals by superior courts also appears now to be an open question in Canadian law. The question whether the defendant has Crown immunity doesn’t really touch the issue whether the plaintiff has a reasonable cause of action rather, it is more akin to statutory defence to an action. It was also alleged that the Board acted with malice and bad faith when it dismissed the appellants’ submissions of apprehension of bias respecting the proposed rehearing of the unfair labour practice complaints in 1998.

c_2000canlii19597.txt,"The accused was charged with uttering threats to his 77 year old mother to cause death to her and his brothers contrary to s.264.1 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The words spoken by the accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously and implied menace to the listeners. The accused's evidence was disbelieved. His constructed story did not 'hang together'.  2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences. Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility. The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference.","The accused was charged with uttering a threat to cause death to three of his children contrary to s. 264.1 of the Criminal Code. The complainant had lived on a farm approximately 30 km. east of Prince Albert for some 64 years. She was the mother of the accused's children.

9_1994canlii7210.txt,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building, to wit: a boat house, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. HELD: The charges were stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 1) The defendants did not deny it, although they did require the crown to prove it, as has been done. They say the bylaws of the resort Village are inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as a abuse of that process. 2) The municipality stepped into that position. Moreover, it could be argued that after the enactment of the interim zoning bylaw in 1986, permission from the municipality had to be obtained if their zoning bylaws did apply, and that is so because they have been singled out from among a great number of offenders for prosecution for, as they see it, no good reason. 3) The Municipality took the position that the expense of maintaining the reserves was the responsibility of the municipality, despite the fact that it was the landowner with the responsibility to prevent trespass, whether or not they became owners of the reserve, and the civil liabilities of the interested parties for trespass to public or municipal reserves are not directly in issue. The municipality did not act out of respect for law, or for pressures to enforce s. 197 or s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the said Act. 4) In the case of subdivisions created after their transfer from the Province to the Municipality, the municipality was responsible for policing, enforcing, and preventing trespass, although, 'politically', it might not be liable to refuse. 5) In some cases, cottage lots do not go to the high water mark. 6) There are access walkways to such public reserves, between cottage lots, set aside on the plan of survey, unless one is familiar with the survey, one would not even be likely to realize that a public reserve exists, let alone realize how to access it from the landside without trespassing on cottage lots. 7) There is no evidence that the municipality ever sought or sought permission to build anything on the reserve. 8) There was no evidence to suggest that any of the defendants, or anyone else,"

The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff's condition related to 2 pre-existing injuries. The only issue which the Court was asked to resolve was whether this accident had caused or contributed to the Plaintiff's injuries. HELD: The question posed was answered in the affirmative. While a normal healthy person might not have been injured in this low speed rear-end collision, the Court was satisfied that, because of the Plaintiff's previous injuries and poor sitting position, the collision did contribute to her current condition in a modest manner.",The plaintiff sought judgment for damages she suffered as a result of the defendant's negligent operation of the motor vehicle owned by the defendant.

5_2014skpc78.txt,"Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","HELD: The Court held that the ITO could not, in the form presented, support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially. The ITO did not disclose grounds to authorize search for items as described, and the search of the computer immediately without further authorization and without providing their return to the justice as set out in the final lines of the search. The Court found that the search was done without authority concerned insufficiency of ITO on which the decision to issue the search warrant was made, and alleged unreasonableness of the issuing justice's decision. The court also found that there was no evidence of a breach of the accused’s right to due process."

The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son. The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application. However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered. The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will. The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business.

The advice and information provided to the plaintiff was provided in the course of his business. He had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of Mayer's intent to benefit Garry was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by Nordstrom are frequently used as estate planning tools why else would there be a beneficiary designation? The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the third party would bear the loss. 2)The plaintiff suffered damages as a result of Nordstrom's negligence. He was ordered to have prejudgments interest for the sum of $34,250.55. The plaintiff had prejudgment interests from the time of the death of his father to his date of birth. 3)Given the defendant's knowledge of the deceased's intent, his failure to advance products that would meet that intent, and his reliance on Mayer fathoming that the beneficiary designation made was void in law, all evidence of a failure of the defendant to discharge his duty of care to the deceased and consequently, his negligence. The court found that the defendant was aware that the deceased wished to designate him as a beneficiary of the fund but failed to take these steps. 4)Given that Nordstrom was a chartered life underwriter and financial consultant who sells life and investment products through Canada Life Assurance Company, he and his client had a business relationship from 1981 to 1987 during which time Mayer purchased life insurance and made investments. In 1993, Mayer purchased an annuity life policy through Nordstrom for lump sum premium of $60,000, naming Garry as its beneficiary. When the annuity matured in 1994, it was withdrawn by Mayer and deposited to his own account. It was Nordstrom who recommended the purchase of units in Trimark Select Balanced Fund, mutual fund which had shown good performance.

b_2002skqb72.txt,"Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278. He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time. The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies. He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit. The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time. Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans. At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines. Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a). The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees. The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs. The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay. Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month. The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.  3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance. The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2). A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald. It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due. If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.","The parties sought to vary the existing child support order. The parties have two children, Luke, age 21 and Amanda, age 18. Under the terms of the order, the respondent was paying child support in the amount of $987 per month on the basis of an income of $80,278. The petitioner is involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither is able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. HELD: 1) Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, supra, both children of the marriage qualify as 'child' under the Act and, if so, the extent of the obligation of parents to support their child. The respondent should pay the Table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post -secondary expenses not covered by student loans.  2) The petitioner's income in 2000 and 2001 was $18,000 per annum out of total living expenses, exclusive of source deductions. Given that the respondent will be relieved from contributing to much of their education expenses, it is argued that it would be unfair that he should also receive full advantage of their employment earnings. 3) The Court of Appeal held that it was appropriate to calculate arrears for the period July to December 2001. 4) The respondent was ordered to pay $1,153 per month based upon the respondent's income. The court found that in the circumstances at hand, the children were not dependent upon their parents during the summer months and have the ability to contribute adequately to their food, shelter and related expenses when not in attendance at school. The Court also found that it is not inappropriate to determine the child's child support obligation in accordance with s. 3(2)(a) of the Guidelines."

d_2006skqb35.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.","The plaintiffs sought an order compelling the defendant to respond to written interrogatories and an order permitting further oral examination for discovery of the plaintiff on issues arising from his responses to the written questions. HELD: The order was granted. Wide latitude was permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the plaintiff's skills, technique, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses, if not already provided, from the defendant regarding the approximate number of occasions that the plaintiff underwent laparoscopic tubal ligation surgery on the plaintiff, Lisa Dawson, and during subsequent care and treatment to repair a puncture to the bowel.

HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children. The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order.","FIAT: The petitioner seeks an order that would enable him to exercise increased access to the two young children born of his relationship with the respondent.

c_2014skqb31.txt,"Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it. The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants. SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance. The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation. The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs. Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured. The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success. The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material. The improper material included information on settlement discussions.","FIAT. The real issue in this application is whether Saskatchewan Mutual Insurance Company (SMI) was in a special relationship of insurer with the plaintiffs that carried a duty of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiffs are policy holders of the defendant SMI. This policy is not an issue in the action commenced by the plaintiffs and is not relied on for coverage in respect of the claim. SMI is the insurer for the defendants and is involved in this claim by virtue of a policy of insurance with the defendants. The defendant farmers had insurance coverage for this type of loss and turned the claim over to SMI to be dealt with. There was no allegation of an increased loss as result of this claim. HELD: 1) The claim against SMI was struck in its entirety. It was not an absolute obligation giving rise to an automatic claim for consequential damages in the event of any failure to make timely payment in accordance with the policy. The broader interpretation urged by the appellants could have far-reaching effects for the insurance industry. In some cases, the risk of being found liable for damages resulting from unsuccessfully contesting a claim against the first defendants would constitute a substantial disincentive for insurers to deny claims, even those which they reasonably and in good faith consider to be either unfounded or inflated. 2) There is no evidence that SMI has an implied contractual covenant to deal with its insureds vis-à-vis the party making a claim. Rather, it has a duty in tort, distinct from the cause of action founded on the express terms of the policy and that is not restricted by the limits in the policy, which would not advance the law or the public interest. 3) It is common ground that the proper approach to the Rule 7-9 for striking a claim as disclosing no reasonable cause is found in Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., 1990 CanLII 90 (SCC), [1990] SCC, [1991] A.J. No. 983 (Q.D.L.R. (4th) 687 (Ont. C.A.). The court found that a breach of the contract of insurance between SMI and the plaintiffs would create an impossible situation for the insurer to avoid paying out on claims or minimizing the amounts paid. It also found that an amendment under Rule 165 should not be allowed if the result would be pleading that could be struck pursuant to Rule 173."
9_2016skpc123.txt,"HELD: The Charter application was granted. The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights had been breached. After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view. The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence. Regarding the impaired driving charge, the accused was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 8 of the Charter. The accused had been attending to conduct a search for a possible impaired driver when she was approached by a woman who was intoxicated and driving with a young child in the vehicle. The officer had walked around the residence looking for the vehicle which had been described to her. She was concerned that perhaps this person was out driving around with the young child. The police officer followed the accused around the home and around the vehicle and in addition the arrival of other officers on scene and placing the accused in handcuffs outside the police car and requesting that she go down to the police station initially, find more objectionable. The Crown did not really argue the impaired driving charge and there was little if any evidence to support the charge. However, the police officer engaged in a warrantless search that was without justification as it was with respect to dwelling house. It affected the accused's privacy, liberty, and human dignity."

HELD: 1) The Court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether to grant an application for severance.  In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.  2) The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than 1 day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or Dumurs. It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them. Specific dates and times should be set aside for the plaintiff to call evidence with respect to its claims against each applicant group.

Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the defendant in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense. 2) There must be some reasonable basis for concluding that the trial of the issue or issues sought to be severed, will put an end to the action. 3) The defendants deny any involvement in the divestiture of Dun-Rite assets or in the dispute between Morrison and Walbaum. 4) The evidence against all of the defendants can be adduced on quantum meruit basis for the plaintiffs’ claim against the defendants. The court will look at all the circumstances in deciding whether the grant the grant of the application. The plaintiffs were equal partners in the defendant’s business. The relationship between the two shareholders broke down and in November 1997, the defendant was ordered to liquidate the defendant. The defendant carried on business as the sole shareholder of the plaintiff. 5) The Sims and the Dumurs brought separate motions. The defendants’ objection to severance did not bear such heavy significance. 6) In this case the plaintiffs were not precluded or required by the defendant to pay the loan proceeds into trust with the law firm of Gerrand Mulatz, solicitors for the Law Firm. The plaintiff was the sole director and person in control of the company. 7) There was no evidence that the defendant diverted virtually all of its assets to himself, his companies, his wife, Tamwal Investments Ltd. and his wife. The objection of the plaintiffs to the severance application does not bear any heavy significance as to the complexity of the evidence. 8) It is not unreasonable to estimate that there will be a small number of applicants attending portions of a trial in relation to each applicant. 9) The applicants should be able to participate at least 21 days prior to the scheduled commencement of trial.  10) There is a reasonable estimate of the time required to participate in the trial.

b_1995canlii5809.txt,"FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee. The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer. The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction. The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination. The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'. The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay. HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable. If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness. 3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise. The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness. 4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule. The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct. 5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.","FIAT.

However, the Grievor shall receive no compensation. The period from August 18, 1993 to the date that this award was treated as a suspension without pay was not discharge. 2)The parole evidence rule precludes the receipt of verbal evidence offered for the purpose of adding to, varying or qualifying in any manner the terms of the written document. The only basis for receipt of oral evidence with respect to the written contract is in the event there is an allegation of intrinsic or extrinsic ambiguity in its terms. 3)The applicant took issue with the fact the Board refused to apply the doctrine of culminating incident and concluded that it was not prepared to accept that the August 1993 incident amounted to a culminating incident.

The current owners of the lot claim that the land is vacant and the Crown may claim an interest in the lands under the Escheats Act.

d_2006skpc95.txt,"The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault for which he received a sentence of 11 months secure custody plus probation for two years, condition of which he take alcohol treatment. He was also found to be a long-term offender. HELD: The Court found that the accused was a long term offender, even if he met the criteria of dangerous offender, and that there must be more than an expression of hope that the person can be treated, but we must not require an absolute guarantee of treatability. The Court also found that there was a significant difference between the accused's current status and that of someone who would normally have been found a 'dangerous offender' and a person who was on probation at the time all of these offences were committed, having been released from custody on Sept. 21, 1992. A review of the law at the outset was held to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility of the accused eventually being controlled in the community, despite the fact that the statutory criteria in Part XXIV of the Code have been interpreted recently by both the Supreme Court of Canada and the Appeal Court of Appeal."
2_2009skqb516.txt,"In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals. In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue. It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH. The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","The issue arises pursuant to s.50(14)(c) of the Agricultural Implements Regulations. While it is obvious that direct ship parts are contractually excluded but the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in the Wheatland agreement, ss. 50(2) and (3) serve to override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. HELD: 1) The issues relate only to the interpretation of the respective priority agreements between TD and the CNH group and to the Interpretation of the Priority Agreement. There may be a similar agreement involving Flexi-Coil but it has not been provided. 2) The contractual provisions clearly entitle the defendant to refuse to restock the inventory of Wheatland. Indeed, they were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers. The employment of the direct ship inventory model was supposedly for the mutual benefit of the parties. That is not the same as the Receiver seeking to change the priorities as between the respective claimants. There are no facts in dispute that the defendants stand as successors to the respective contracting parties, and have assumed their respective rights and obligations relating to the TD priority agreements. 3) There is no basis to contend that the kinds of articles involved were in any way unique. The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by TD and Wheatland and inventory and the credits financed by the NHCC that Wheatland has not paid for. 4) The parties contend that ss.51(2), (3), and (4) serve in the interests of the contracting parties and the impact of the agreement. It is not in dispute the defendant stood as a successor to TD and CNH Canada and the Company that are successors to them. The issue here is the definition of'specialty' and 'one-off' items. 5) The defendants are entitled to claim prior security to the credits generated by the parts returned based on the reasoning that parts, the proceeds of parts returned and the Credits, other than choses in action, rights and contracts arising from the sale by the dealer of parts and services in the ordinary course of its business. 6) The defendant is entitled to recover its balance of payments from Wheatland for the purposes of the priority agreement. 7) The plaintiff's claim is adjusted to $88,724.

c_1998canlii13533.txt,"FIAT. An application to vary maintenance for two children under the Federal Child Supprt Guidelines. At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d). The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields. He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October. He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work. The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated. HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month. 1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income. The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997. Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past. No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded. In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable. The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck. The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children. His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute. Leave was given to return the matter to the Court with the appropriate supporting materials.  3)No order as to costs.","FIAT. An application to vary maintenance under the Federal Child Support Guidelines in respect of two children. The father had previously rented equipment from his father and his 1996 return shows and expense of $4,000 for machine rental paid. In 1997 he acquired equipment of his own and claimed capital cost disallowance in lieu of renting equipment. HELD: 1)The application was granted on the basis of the determination of income for the father and whether the expenses of the eldest child constituted extraordinary expenses for secondary school. 2)Costs were to be determined by the mother. 3)The father's income from 1995 to the current date was set out below. The purchase of equipment was an extravagance of significant proportions. The allocation of one-half the cost to farming use may be questionable given the distances travelled to and from the mine during the course of his employment. The acquisition of the equipment and claiming of capital cost allowance in these circumstances was not patently unreasonable. 4)The costs of the step-child's pet should be excluded."
c_2013skpc94.txt,"A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs. The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children. They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated. The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access. The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister. HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b). The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister. The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.","The agency initially applied for a long term order under s.37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act but had amended its application to now apply for an order that the current foster parents be declared persons having a sufficient interest in all three children under ss.23 of the Act, and an order granting them custody. The children were identified by initials for the purposes of protecting their identity. HELD: The agency applied for and was granted custody of the children. Pursuant to s.31, the agency requested personal service of this decision be provided to each of those individuals within 15 days of receipt of it. The amended application was granted. 1)Each child was in need of protection pursuant to ss.11(b) and s.17(b). As the first option was unavailable, the question was whether or not a placement with the proposed persons of sufficient interest would be preferable to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. The revised plan being proposed by the agency was appropriate in these circumstances. 2)The father, having agreed to a long-term order, had consented to a lesser order. The father was clear that he was unable to care for the children and indicated that he intended to continue to provide a stable and nurturing environment for them. As all individuals involved are members of and live on the same First Nation, continuing contact between the father and his children is more easily accommodated. The Agency's revised plan is appropriate in the circumstances. 3)The evidence before the agency clearly indicates that the father does wish to have a continuing relationship with the children, and that he clearly recognizes that he is not in a position, due to his circumstances, to offer a stable or nurturing environment."
4_2005skqb265.txt,"The respondent applies to vary his 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for him. In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month. The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive. HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.  1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court. In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2) The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met. If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3) By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him. The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her. There was no justification for the payment to continue. It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.","FIAT: The respondent applies to vary his February 28, 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 1, 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for August 2004. The issue of whether these orders should be made retroactive was reserved and the sole issue now before the Court. HELD: The court finds that the circumstances leading to the award of retroactive child support are not the same as ongoing support. The parties' incomes were similar to what they had been in 1992 and the children continued to spend substantial portion of their time with their mother. The court weighs all of the objectives set out in s. 17 of the Divorce Act and the factors to be taken into consideration."
2_2010skqb444.txt,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19 as am. He applies for an order excluding evidence of cocaine found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter, (the Charter) were violated. HELD: 1) The accused's right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure under s. 7 of the Act was infringed. 2) The evidence was excluded from s. 24(2). 3) The Court found that the accused had reasonable expectation of privacy in his vehicle. The evidence should not be excluded. 4) There was no breach of the accused's privacy."

The policy did not cover the periods he would be in Saskatchewan where he ordinarily resided with his parents. The plaintiff suffered chest pain following a water-skiing accident in August 1997 in Saskatchewan and underwent a thoracostomy for a collapsed lung while in Saskatchewan. He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA. MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy. The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary. They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $26,864.46 plus costs, to be taxed. 1)The evidence that travel was dangerous and put the plaintiff's life in jeopardy was accepted. Therefore the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for the surgery. 2)The exclusionary clause did not exempt MSI from liability for payment. The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation under the policy to extend the benefits in question. The policy was in effect from August 1, 1997 to July 31, 1998. It was not raised in a letter confirming the dates of his coverage sent after the plaintiff had experienced the pneumothorax of which MSI had been informed.","The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from the defendant for the period of time he expected to reside in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. pursuing his optometry studies. During that period, the plaintiff required medical attention and surgery, necessarily performed in Chicago for a condition undetected earlier by qualified medical personnel and therefore not a pre-existing condition as that term is defined in the policy. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $26,864.46 prayed for in this action together with costs to be taxed. The plaintiff will have judgment for the sum of $8,864 to be paid in the event of a condition existing the effective date of this policy. The terms of the policy and the portion relied upon by MSI in support of one of its reasons for non-payment do not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation to pay because the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for surgery."

2008skqb287.txt,"The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.",The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned 18 years.

c_2007skpc41.txt,"The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification? HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later. At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief. Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer. As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s.89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act.

The plaintiff argued in response that the defendant was estopped from claiming repayment. Ordering the benefits be re-paid, that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation, on the basis of representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it. It would be illogical to prevent the defendant from getting its money back when it is found that the benefits were paid on the basis of faulty information provided by the plaintiff. This is not a situation in which estoppel lies against the defendant.","The common law wife started an action against the defendant, Midway Motors Ltd., and the insurer of the defendant's vehicle. She was injured when the defendant hit her from behind while operating the vehicle. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant was estopped from claiming a repayment of the money it had paid her under Schedule B of the Paris insurance policy. The defendant argued that by failing to indicate any interest in claiming repayment of those benefits until after the commencement of the litigation, the defendant caused the wife to 'alter her position to her detriment' by continuing to accept the money. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded costs of $140 for the loss of income from employment for the period during which the defendant suffered substantial inability to perform the essential duties of the occupation or employment provided by the defendant pursuant to Schedule 'B'. The defendant was ordered to pay the plaintiff $140 per week for 129 weeks. This amount was to be paid to the plaintiff on the basis of what the plaintiff testified to be misrepresentation and unprovable assertions. The court found that the plaintiff had not shown that she was employed at the time of the accident and that she did not show that she worked for any six months out of the preceding 12 months and so did not fall within the deeming provisions."
d_2004nsfc13.txt,"The mother was unable to care for the child and the father, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was only entitled to supervised access. Both the paternal and maternal grandmothers presented plans of care to the court, with the paternal grandmother seeking custody and the maternal grandmother seeking care and control of the child. The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother. The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody. The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them.","The child was placed in the permanent care and custody of the maternal grandmother, who was a convicted child abuser whose name appeared on the Child Abuse Register, having been sentenced to thirty-nine months in prison as a result of the conviction. The father, V.M., who lived with his maternal grandmother in the Halifax area, lived with the paternal grandmother and had three children of his own, one of whom was now eight years old. The maternal grandmother had access to the child by court order, supervised only, but there was evidence he had the care of his son in an unsupervised situation. The child's mother indicated that she would move to a larger residence if she got custody. HELD: The child was granted custody under s. 41(1)(a) of the Children and Family Services Act. An order was made under the Maintenance and Custody Act granting custody to the paternal grandparent who will be required to facilitate access amongst the various parties, some of which will be supervised within her discretion. The court reviewed the circumstances of the two children and found that there was a bond between the paternal and maternal grandmother and that the child was in need of protection who would ideally be placed for adoption. The mother was better set up in her home to receive the child and that she was more financially stable. Although number of her children have been in regular conflict with the law, the mother has always exercised proper parenting skills."
3_1999canlii2586.txt,"One of the residual legatees of the respondent estate filed a petition under s. 31(1) of the Probate Act. At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.' The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act. The executor appealed. He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding. This was also one of those rare occasions where solicitor and client costs on the appeal were warranted, as the executor's actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which the Court termed reprehensible and unconscionable.","The appellant was found guilty of a flagrant breach of fiduciary obligations owed by him as executor of her estate. He was ordered to pay $250,000 by way of a bond with two sureties and to provide $50,000 to his niece. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed; costs as between solicitor and client awarded to the respondent, Merilyn Hendry, as well as to respondent Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church. These costs to be taxed are to be paid forthwith by the appellant personally. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellant's acknowledged actions constituted a flagr breach of the fiduciaries owed by the respondent. These actions constituted sufficient justification for his removal as the executor. 2)The respondent was found to have converted estate funds to his own use and that those actions resulted in the appellant having done a real disservice to the estate. 3)The Court found that the appellant had committed serious dereliction of duty which was required by s.31(1) of the Probate Act. The Court ordered that his executor's file be delivered to the court. The respondent appealed. He argued that the Court erred in granting an order without first requiring proof of and making determination of whether the appellant was wasting the estate, or without determining that an executor has the same right and authority to control the assets of the estate as the testatrix would have if living, unless and until, there is proof that such a person is wasting his or her time."

d_2013skpc206.txt,"HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","HELD: The Court found that there was no loan of $1,000.00 to Christos as far as it was concerned. The amount of damages was not known at this time and as the defendant may be able to now qualify and receive funds retroactively for special benefits from Service Canada, the issue of the defendant's claim is adjourned to a date to be determined by the parties and the Court will hear evidence and argument on the quantum of damages to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant Lilia.  1) There was actually no loan given to the plaintiff as far that is concerned. There is no record of it, as far, as loan documentation goes. The accounting records do not show it as wages advanced as testified to by the defendant. 2) The counterclaim as to the $2,400.00 is not proven. No evidence was put forward by Lilia that supports that these payments were not consented to and agreed to.  3) Lilia's testimony as to working four hours a day with one day off for eight days was not accepted. There was no evidence to support this allegation. 4) The $5,000 was a loan, as there's no loan documentation prepared and/or signed which one would anticipate considering the plaintiff is a corporation. The plaintiff is entitled to damages as against the defendant for negligence in the filing of the record of employment.  5) As the amount of the damages is not known, the defendant has not made out, on balance of probabilites, if she now qualifies for payment from service Canada. It may be that there are no damages incurred if she becomes eligible for payment.  6) The defendant claims that there is actually a loan given, as well as a cash advance and a repayment of the advance, which there is no basis to withhold the $960 from Christos on his last cheque.  7) The accountant testified that he was unhappy about Lilia being asked to work less hours by her doctor, and one of the reasons she was dismissed was that she did not have 600 hours of insurable employment which she had in mind, in order to collect maternity leave benefits.  8) The plaintiff filed a demand letter close to the time of issuing the Statement of Claim, but there is nothing to support that the plaintiff could have made a verbal loan with the defendants.  9) The accountants did not put forth any information to support the allegation that the defendant ever asked Lilia for funds back for expenses incurred by her."
4_2004skqb280.txt,"This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","FIAT: This is an application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act (ISLA) for a declaration of paternity and child support. The parties never lived together but had an intimate relationship which resulted in the birth of a child. HELD: 1) Based on the evidence, the applicant's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education was 'unreasonable'. The Court will impute income in the same fashion that it did before the introduction of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. 2) The Court must consider what is reasonable under the circumstances. It will not be presumed simply because the applicant has the legal responsibility for another child or children and/or because the standard of living of the applicant is lower than that of the other spouse. The court must establish that any continued unemployment is unintentional or, if intentional, that it is reasonable in the circumstances and does not warrant the imputation of income. The applicant must lead cogent evidence to establish why the table amount would cause undue hardship."
b_2010skqb311.txt,"The accused was charged with having aftermarket tint on the side windows of his vehicle. He appealed on other grounds. The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion. The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations. HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established. Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty. The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations. The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio. The conviction was quashed.","The appellant was convicted after an ex parte trial before a Traffic Safety Court justice of operating a motor vehicle with after-market tinted side windows contrary to s. 66(3) of the Vehicle Equipment Regulations (VER Regulations) and was fined $350. The appeal was allowed and the conviction was quashed. The Crown did not prove their case of sunscreen being present. The Offence Notice issued on January 25, 2008 failed to describe the alleged offence. The fine issued exceeded the original fine by 333% plus surcharge. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)It is not possible to amend the count so as to cure the defect. This is because the count, as drafted, is a nullity, and is not capable of amendment.  2)The appeal is allowed. The conviction is quashed because it is so palpably bad that it does not give fair notice to the defendant of the nature of the charge nor the penalties that may be imposed if a breach is established.  3)The Court found that it is impossible to simply change the count to fix the defect, which is not an essential component of the offence.  4)It would appear that the modern approach to determining the sufficiency of informations and indictments dictates that only counts that are drafted so poorly that they bear no resemblance to an existing offence will be found to be 'void' or labelled an 'offence not known to law'."
b_2012skqb350.txt,"The applicant wife sought an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. The consent judgment provided that the husband should make an equalization payment of $105,000 to be composed of cash and/or a rollover of retirement funds. The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax. Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000. The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value. The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application. The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs. Therefore, the Court ordered that the judgment be satisfied by way of rollover of RRSPs in the amount of $111,600.","FIAT The issue is the interpretation of a consent judgment based on a negotiated family property settlement. Present counsel for the husband is new to the file, and was not involved in the settlement. The wife seeks an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. HELD: 1) The court was satisfied that the parties had come to an agreement that was binding and enforceable. The fact it was not specifically spelled out in the judgment is not fatal. Recognition of a discount for tax on RRSPs was explicit in the wife's position in her pre-trial calculations, and in all valuations of property discussed thereafter. 2) It would be unfortunate if the time is beyond you to appeal but the court could always seek leave to appeal. 3) The Court was also satisfied that there was some ambiguity in the language of the judgment. The court must examine the context in which the order was issued, evaluate the order in accordance with the circumstances of the case, and question whether the acts or omissions could reasonably have been contemplated to fall under the terms of the agreement."

Application dismissed; the evidence would not be so complex and scientific that the plaintiff's substantive right to a jury trial should be denied.

The accident was substantially based on injuries he received in the accident and more specifically, on the treatment provided to him by the other respondent at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital. The applicant's wife, who died shortly after the accident, was also a party by virtue of her cross-claim against the doctor. HELD: The evidence relating to causation will be limited in time (since the medical interventions occurred within 2 to 3 days), in the most relevant anatomical area (the thoracic vertebrae region of the spinal column) and in the number of medical personnel involved in the relevant interventions. The essence of the liability issue will not be so complex and scientific as to warrant a trial by jury. The medical experts will mainly focus on the interventions of the physicians and neurosurgeons at the medical centres. The principal subject matter will be the medical condition of the applicant and his wife. Counsel for the applicant suggested that an expert report from an economist would be presented at trial in support of his position. The expert report was in addition to the assessment of damages to an applicant totally disabled from employment as well as the usual medical evidence. The court considered splitting the two elements of the trial between the judge and the jury, noting that there may be circumstances where it would be equitable to split, but declined to do so."

Dismissing the appeal, that the insurer of a subcontractor on a construction project was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss by the insurer of the principle contractor where the risk was allocated by the contract documents to the principle contractor and not the subcontractor.","This was an appeal from a decision declaring that the respondent Guardian was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss insured against by the appellant Hartford. The respondent had entered into a contract with Fraser-Brace for the construction of a hospital and required the insurer to obtain fire insurance to protect the parties against fire loss. A trial judge found that the building was never at the insured's risk; that the policy was void and that the insurer was not responsible for the loss. He ordered Hartford to repay Guardian the advances with compound interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)There was no evidence nor even suggestion that Delta caused the fire. The obligation to insure the risk had been allocated to Fraser Brace by the contract with the Province. As Delta did not cause the fire loss it had no liability to the Province or Fraser's Brace for causing the loss and in summary there was no tortious or contractual liability of Delta for which Guardian was required to respond as Delta's insurer. There had been no breach of contract between the respondent and the appellant. 2)The appellant had no obligation to the respondent to pay the fire as Delta, under its subcontract with Fraser‑Brace, was always at risk for fire loss to the province's property. 3)The appeal on the main issue ought to be dismissed. There is no evidence of the appellant causing the fire nor any suggestion that it caused it. 4)The respondent's claim for compound interest was rejected by the trial judge."
1999canlii12687.txt,"The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act. The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police. A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road. The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine. The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches. HELD: The evidence is excluded. The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance. The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question. The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement. The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation. The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get. The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van. The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law. The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van. The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event. The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by a police officer as a result of a warrantless search. The officer observed a rental van stopped on a grid road leading to a tourist information booth. As he approached the vehicle, he noticed that one of the pockets of the accused's jeans appeared to be bulging and asked if he could empty his pockets. When the officer asked if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused responded that he was looking for a place to relieve himself, the officer told the accused he had two cases of wine in the back of the van and asked him if he needed any assistance. The accused said he did not require a warrant as he felt that if he left the van on the grid road while he went to get a warrant he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe the accused had committed the offence of bringing more than 1.14 litres of wine into the province and exigent circumstances existed in that it was necessary to conduct a search before the accused drove away with the evidence. The search was unreasonable as it was not authorized by law and the fact that the target of the detention was in an automobile did not enhance the police power to detain that individual."

The Court believed the testimony of the complainant.,"The accused was charged with two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code and for sexual purposes touching a person under the age of 16 directly with part of his body, to wit his penis. The complainant testified that she did not believe the accused when he told her that he remained in the basement of the house for most of the night in question, that he did not go to K.S.'s bedroom and that he never had contact with her. The accused elected trial by way of indictment on both charges. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. The Court found that the evidence of the complainant as to what transpired in the bedroom during the early hours of March 1 was not credible. The evidence on the other side of the argument was not supported by the evidence on either side. The court found that there was no evidence that the accused had pulled the blanket away from her or that he removed his pants when she told the officer that she didn't know if the blanket was removed or if she did see him remove his pants. It was entirely possible for the jury to disbelieve the complainant and conclude that they had reasonable doubt as to the credibility of the witnesses."
3_2001skqb332.txt,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.","The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act. The appellants had been operating as a Goods and Services Tax Registrant and while subject to the provisions of the Act, unlawfully failed to file goods and services tax returns for the period January 1, 1999 to March 31, 1999. The respondent had been the sole director of the corporation. The appellant had not requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The Act does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. It was open to the trial judge to find that the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by some person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. 2)Section 330 of the Income Tax Act provides for an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act. It is trite law that the right to be tried in reasonable time arises only after an individual has been charged. 3)Once charges were laid the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable period of time."
b_1997canlii10986.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs applied for an order striking out the statement of defence and counterclaim and separate statement of Helen Rilkoff as not disclosing a reasonable defence or cause of action. The plaintiffs claimed the doctrine of res judicata applied to the claim for damages by virtue of two Small Claims court judgments in 1989 and 1992. The defendants asserted their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was different than those previously dealt with. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The fact that the plaintiffs filed a 55 page brief in support of their submissions and the defendants filed a 14 page brief in response evidenced that the issues were not easily resolved and certainly not on a summary basis.  2)An application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justifiable dispute is revealed.

Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve the questions of law.",FIAT.

Both parties had referred to judgment of this Court in support of their allegation that the doctrine of resjudicata applies to the defendants claim for damages by virtue of two Small Claims court judgments in 1989 and 1992. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs in any event of the cause of action. 1)The issues raised did not appear susceptible of being simply resolved on a summary basis and certainly not on a summarily basis. 2)Issues raised in the defendants Statement of defence did not disclose a reasonable defence nor did the issues in the counter-statement show a reasonable cause of actions. 3)The application of the plaintiffs was therefore premature.

The application for a change of venue is denied. 2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue. There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports. However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application. In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue. However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found. Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre. It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered.","FIAT: The applicant brought an application for a change of venue in this matter pursuant to s.599(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada. The accused seeks an order granting a trial in Prince Albert or any other judicial centre as the Court deems appropriate. The Crown counsel opposed the application. HELD: The application was denied. 1)The applicant has not met the onus of proof necessary to succeed on this application. 2)A properly instructed jury will be able to deal with the issues in the trial impartially and in accordance with the evidence presented, such that the accused will receive a fair trial."

At the second intersection he collided with another vehicle, causing serious injury to three people. He pleaded guilty to three counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm; the Crown proposed an intermittent sentence, but the judge sentenced him to nine months incarceration concurrent on each count plus two years probation with conditions. The appellant appealed on the grounds the judge failed to consider the Crown's recommendation, failed to sufficiently state his reasons, and the sentence was excessive. Dismissing the appeal, that the sentencing power of a judge is not limited by Crown submissions, that the failure to state every reason does not constitute and error, and that in view of the appellant's record and other factors, the sentence was not excessive to the point of constituting a reversible error.",The appellant pled guilty in Provincial Court to three charges of dangerous driving causing bodily harm.

The limitation period for suing under Section D had expired and no notice of the application had been given to the insurer. The chambers judge held that he had no discretion to grant the amendment and dismissed the application. The plaintiff appealed. Appeal allowed; the plaintiff is entitled to renew the application for the amendment in Supreme Court chambers on notice to the proposed, as well as the existing, defendant within sixty days of today's date; if not filed within that time, the application to add the insurer will be deemed to have been abandoned. The court had a discretion to grant the amendment even though the case did not fall within any of the specific situations set out in Rule 15.02 as the broad power to amend conferred by Rule 15 is not limited to the specific instances set out the Rule. Although there was no firm rule that notice to a proposed defendant was necessary in all such applications, generally the applicant should give notice to the proposed defendant (as well as the existing parties) where it is apparent from the circumstances that the proposed defendant likely has a reasonable basis to oppose being joined, such as being prejudiced in its defence by the plaintiff's long delay in asserting his claim.","The appellant appealed the decision of the chambers judge granting leave to the appellant to amend his claim to add Lombard as a party and to assert the Section cause of action against it. He argued that the Rules gave the judge discretion to grant the amendment and that the judge should have granted it. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; leave to appeal allowed; the trial judge's order dismissing the application; the appellant's application to renew; the limitation period being expiring and the respondent's failure to give notice of the application to make the amendment granted. The respondent appealed. The trial judge held that he did not have authority under Rules 15.01 and 15.02 to grant leave to amend and the appellant had no discretion to do so. The appeal judge also held that the rules gave the appellant the discretion to amend, even though limitation period had expired. The limitation period in this case was expiring in January 2019 and the applicant was not given notice."
8_1996canlii4963.txt,The appellant was acquitted of communicating with another person for the purpose of prostitution. A new trial was ordered on the basis that the Provincial Court judge included a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with the respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The Queen's Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test that set out in R. v. Schmidt. HELD: The proper disposition is to set aside the judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence. 1)On reading the entire oral judgment the court concluded that the judge was saying in effect that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. 2)The trial judge was incorrect in finding that under s.213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid.,"The appellant was acquitted after trial in the Provincial Court of communicating with another person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution contrary to s. 213(1)(c) of the Code. However, on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench a new trial was ordered, and it is from that judgment that this appeal arises. HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1)If indeed the provincial court judge had found that under s 213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid for them, she was incorrect. 2)The facts before the learned Chief Judge constituted evidence from which a properly instructed jury could reasonably infer that the respondent was communicating with a female person, for the purposes of paying, and for which he intended to pay. The fact that the conversation did not reach the point where the matter of payment was discussed would not preclude a jury from reasonably concluding that an act of prostitution involving the payment of money for sexual favours was contemplated. It was strongly urged by the Crown, and conceded by counsel for the defence, that this was the correct test. 3)If the Queen’s Bench judge had also interpreted her oral reasons to include a requirement as an element of the Actus Reus for an offence under s213 that there be a particular conversation with respect to payment of the money for specified sexual services, she would have refused the nonsuit. 4)This was an error in law and cited as a correct test a comment in R. v.

4_2011skpc13.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care or control. The Court dismissed the charge of care or control over .08 after a non-suit application. During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying. During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech. In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.  The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document. The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out. While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence. This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1).","The accused applied to the Court pursuant to s.24(1) and s.2(2) of the Charter for remedies, which included a stay of the impaired driving charge, an order for a mistrial on that count, a direction that the Crown prosecutor be allowed to further cross-examine Crown witnesses and an order excluding evidence. HELD: The accused's right to make full answer and defence under s.7 was infringed. 1)The accused did not know the full content of the Operational Checksheets until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document, Cst. Pshyk. 2)Had he known of the reference to slurred speech in the original document, he would not have challenged the Crown on his failure to made mention of it. 3)Had the Crown referred to the Checksheet, the accused would have known that such a question would inevitably drawn the re-direct examination which occurred in this case. 4)Had it known the full contents of the original check sheet, he could have challenged it. Had he known that the original was what he had in his file and what had been disclosed to the defence, the defence would have been able to challenge it. 5)The Court found that bad faith was the cause of the lack of disclosure on the part of either the accused or the accused. The officer inadvertently failed to copy the full extent of the operational Chechsheets, and the incomplete copy went to both the defence lawyer and the Crown's agent. That is because, had he known about the reference, under the heading Observations on Subject, the Crown would have referred to Exhibit P-2. The original checksheet did not have a section entitled observations on Subject or section for the technician's name. 6)The officer did not make any notation in his notes or in his General Occurrence Report about his observations of the accused after his arrest and at the RCMP detachment. That would have inevitably drawn an inquiry which occurred. 7)The trial judge should only exclude evidence for late disclosure in exceptional cases: (a)where the trial process unfair and this unfairness cannot be remedied through an adjournment and disclosure order or (b) where exclusion is necessary to maintain the integrity of the justice system. This is not a case where bad faith is the cause."
9_2013skca110.txt,"HELD: The Court addressed the issue of jurisdiction by holding that it would follow its usual practice to refuse to hear an entirely new matter argued for the first time on appeal. Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act. The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested. The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act. However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.","The appellant appeals the decision of the Chambers judge dismissing his application under Queen's Bench Rule 173(e) and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to strike out or stay the application of the Director of Community Operations for a community safety order under The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act. Part II of SCAN sets out in some detail the nature and potential terms of Part II orders. The order being appealed is by its terms not an order under Part II. The jurisdiction to hear the appeal can be found in the Court's general jurisdiction under ss.7 and 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, and on the basis of that, the Court has jurisdiction in the circumstances of this case."

HELD: 1) An order requiring the husband to take out loan to pay an interim amount is not justified on the evidence. 2) Where there is a significant disparity in the incomes of each of the former spouses in the immediate post-separation period and such economic disparity defines a corresponding disparity in their affordability of lifestyles, the husband must take steps to alleviate the wife's need for support. 3) The wife's application for an interim order is dismissed. 4) The net assets for the interim distribution exceed the amount requested. 5) There is no evidence that the net assets far exceed what the wife has requested. 6) Spousal Support is appropriate where there is significant economic disparity between the former spouse's incomes and the current economic situation. The wife must absorb the additional cost of child care in his care. The husband's obligation to support the minor child in the care must be absorbed by the child in his custody. Where there are significant disparities in the wife’s incomes, such as in the absence of a substantial income adjustment, the wife must take immediate steps to absorb the immediate cost of her child care expenses.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)There was clearly no basis for adding the value of the grain on hand to the income of the respondent. There was no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and the grain was to be viewed as part of his gross income in the year in which it was sold. 2)There was no reversible error by the chamber judge in accepting the respondent's agreement to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income. What if any portion should be added must be based on the facts of each case.,The appellant sought to have support payments ordered by the chamber judge increased on the basis the respondent's income was incorrectly estimated and should have been much greater.

The court was satisfied that the application was in the best interests of justice and granted the order. The applicant was also entitled to severance if the issues were not severed. The Court was also in agreement with Noble J. of the Court in his judgment dealing with other issues of this action and took the time to express his concerns over the delay the plaintiff had up to that time been subjected to by the paper war, the paper-war, the litigation and the political interference. The plaintiff was stalled in the pursuit of resolution of the issues of his claim. In bringing this application, the applicant asserted that he was ready for trial and that he had been ready for some considerable period of time.

The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault. Allowing the appeal, that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity. The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward. The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.",This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his estranged wife.

The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below. The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant. For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances. No error was made on this issue. The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz. The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting. She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests. There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them. The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children. There is no material error or misapprehension of the evidence.","The father appeals from the decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties' children. The father argues that the chambers judge erred in her application by failing to apply the principle of maximum contact, by applying a presumption of the status quo and by finding that evidence as to the wishes of the children was irrelevant. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Chambers judge correctly stated that s. 17(9) of the Act does not provide a sufficient basis upon which to order shared parenting. 2)The evidence regarding the children's wishes was limited and inconclusive. The Chambers judge was entitled not only to take into account the change in circumstances but was required to do so as part of her broader consideration of the child's needs and needs. There was no error in the judge's assessment of the situation in which the children wished to spend more time with the father. 3)The Court was unable to draw a clear conclusion from the evidence on all of the issues raised by the parties."

She also complained of the transmission being made without her having had an opportunity to oppose it because there was no hearing associated with it. 5)The order was to be applied for by the applicant in the amount of $215,000.

b_2001skqb124.txt,"The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board. Under the voluntary arrangement doctors who chose not to enter the arrangement remained on-call to look after their own patients and to respond to emergencies. It worked well until Hanna established another clinic and began dividing his time between Regina and the Moosomin clinic. HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.  1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct. When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him. Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital. He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence. He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days. Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition. His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors. The on-call arrangement was voluntary. There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood. There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.  4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District. Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors. There was no basis in law or fact supporting the existence of a fiduciary relationship between Hanna and the Health District.","The plaintiff medical doctor brought an action against the defendants alleging that each of them owed a duty of trust and a fiduciary duty to act towards him in good faith in connection with an arrangement entered into by all of them to perform the on-call services required of them by the defendant, Pipestone District Health Board. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)There was no evidence either in fact or in law supporting the existence of a trust or a relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. 2)The proposed system was completely voluntary. The plaintiff could not join or not join. 3)There is no evidence of any breach giving rise to an action for damages. 4)The hospital was neither the originator of the on call arrangement introduced by the doctors nor party to it. The administrator of the hospital tolerated the plan and to that extent only co-operated with the doctors in its implementation because when it operated well it delivered to the hospital. The hospital was not the hospital's originator and the physician choosing not to enter into the arrangement would remain on call to look after his own patients at all times and to respond to emergencies."
7_2001canlii346.txt,"The Crown withdrew one count at the opening of the trial and the accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration in excess of .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying. The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.","The accused stands charged that he consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, had the care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called as witnesses the boyfriend of the accused's sister-in-law, Dawn Anderson, and the doctor who was working with the accused at the time of the accident. HELD: 1) The facts were in the mind of the officer when he decided to make the demand, whether he was of the opinion that the taking of the blood samples from the accused would not endanger his life or health, whether the doctor had acted to prevent any occurrence that would have endangered the life of his patient, and whether he would have acted to ensure that the blood sample was taken by a qualified medical practitioner or under the supervision of a medical practitioner. 2) The evidence was in relation to a visit by the officer at the hospital and not at his home. The doctor testified that he relied on police officers and trusts them. The officer testified that if he said it was okay to take the sample, he would not have done so. 3) There was no evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that either the doctor took the samples himself or the technician took them under the direction of the doctor. The evidence at trial disclosed that the medical practitioner had no recollection of having the doctor complete the wrong form (P-2). The medical practitioner testified that the doctor advised him that it would be okay to do so. 4) The Court was left with reasonable doubt as to whether the officer acted beyond reasonable doubt on the facts. The facts in this case did amount to reasonable and probable grounds for his doing so."
d_2011skpc110.txt,"The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused attempted unsuccessfully to reach Legal Aid duty counsel. HELD: The accused was arbitrarily detained for 11 minutes and a sample of his breath was obtained. However, the officer appeared to have acted in good faith. The admission of the Certificate of Analyses would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights were not infringed. 2) There was a range in the potential impact upon an accused, from 'fleeting and technical to profoundly invasive'. The more serious the effect of the breach on the accused's right to contact counsel, the greater the risk that the admission of a breath sample would bring to the administration. 3) There is little in the accused’s testimony upon which to determine the impact of the detention upon him. There was nothing to indicate he could not have made the demand forthwith, even though the device itself was not yet present. In the alternative, the accused submits his rights under s. 8, 9, 10 and 14 of the Charter.  4) The Court found that there was a reasonable limit to the time between the demand to provide breath sample into an ASD and the taking of the sample was 11 minutes."
9_2005nssc297.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended. The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal entered. The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle. But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.","This appeal arises from a decision of the Adjudicator in the Provincial Court of Nova Scotia who convicted the appellant for driving a motor vehicle while his license was suspended contrary to s. 287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. The adjudicator made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence of three other witnesses, his son Dennis Guthro who testified it was he who drove the car but that his son was in the vehicle. The appeal centers upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the Crown's evidence and the reliability of the evidence, i.e., his glimpse of the appellant driving his auto as a sole occupant while unlicensed versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant was not the driver. HELD: The appeal of the conviction is allowed. The Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed the importance of taking into account the special position of the trier of fact on matters of credibility. In R. v. Biniaris, [1992] S.C.R. 122, 1992 CarswellONT 90 wherein McLachlin J. commented on the scope of appellate review in summary conviction appeals. Absent an error of law or miscarriage of justice, the test to be applied by the Summary Conviction Appeal Court is whether the findings of the trial judge are unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. Given the experience of both the appellant and the other witnesses and the credibility of the defence witness, the Court was unable to determine whether the appellant's evidence was sufficiently credible to warrant an acquittal."

The chambers judge granted the application finding that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information and that to allow the writ to stand would constitute an abuse of process. The issue on appeal is whether the chambers judge erred in inquiring into the accuracy of the facts sworn to in the proposed appellant's affidavit, in light of the provision in Rule 407(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules that provides that the validity of the writ shall not be questioned in any interlocutory proceeding where the affidavit substantially complies with the requirements of the Rule.

The ruling of the chambers judge raises an issue of considerable importance to the general operation of the writ of replevin as provided for in the Rules of Court.","The proposed appellants sought and obtained a writ of replevin in relation to some valuable breeding dogs. The sheriff seized two of the disputed dogs and seized two others.

HELD: (1)Application dismissed. The Provincial Court judge was not biased and the accused received full disclosure with respect to the charge. In an application to quash committal for trial there is only one ground for action by the reviewing court and that is lack of jurisdiction. (2)Application dismissed. The conditions imposed by the Provincial Court Judge were justified. He did not err in law or in his application of the facts.,The accused applied to quash a Provincial Court order committing him to stand trial on a charge that he committed a defamatory libel against a police officer contrary to ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code and to an ongoing investigation of another potential offence. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was not a scintilla of evidence to suggest either the Provincial Court judge was biased or that there was an apprehension of bias. 2)The accused appeared to admit full disclosure with respect to the defamation charge and that his complaint was with respectto an ongoing criminal investigation. 3)The judge did not receive proper disclosure from the prosecutor.
b_2011skpc19.txt,"The accused was a passenger in a van where the driver was stunting on the complainant's street. The complainant was an off duty police officer who left his home and knocked on the passenger window. The accused exited the van and assaulted the complainant resulting in the complainant receiving a broken nose and ankle. The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer. The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer. 1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed. Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.  2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other. The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer.","HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and of unlawfully assaulting a peace officer. The accused had used more force than was necessary to defend himself, which took him out of the protection afforded to him by s. 34 of the Code. The Court also found that even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more than is necessary to protect himself, taking him into the breach of the peace protection afforded him by ss. 34(1)(a) and s. 266(2). The accused was found guilty of the aggravated assault on the peace officer on count 1. HELD: 1) There was no evidence offered by the accused to contradict any Crown evidence and the evidence considered by me left him convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he was acting the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene, to prevent the continuation of the breach. 2) The Court was left with the issue of whether the accused's defence of self defence was available to him and whether he was properly identified and properly acting as police officer in the line of duty at the time the assault took place. It was not clear to the bystander that the assault could have been caused by the assault. It is also not clear if the accused had an objective foresight of bodily harm, that results from the actions of an accused."
d_2004nssc196.txt,"The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for breach of contract in regard to the defendants' refusal to return to her the substantial security deposit that she paid as part of a motel lease. After being clearly told that the money would not be returned, she waited 9 years before commencing the action. The plaintiff applied for an order disallowing the defendants' limitation defence. Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed. The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled. Not only was there a presumption that the evidence would now be less cogent than it would have been, but the defendants' storage warehouse was destroyed by fire 3 years ago resulting in the loss of many old records, including those relating to the motel.","The plaintiff claims for breach of contract in the amount of $20,000 as well as general damages and exemplary damages. The defendants counterclaim for additional rent and unpaid business taxes for 1992. HELD: The Court finds that the delay in this case is full nine years after the cause of action arose. The plaintiff's lawyer had stated the nature of the claim to the defendants in his letter of 30 October 1992. It is presumed that this was done on the instructions of Cluett. The defendant was prevented from determining what, if any, old records would have been germane to the defence of the plaintiff's action. The Court also finds that there is a presumption that the evidence would be less cogent than it otherwise would be.  1)The Court is satisfied that the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled so they had no possible reason to give any notice to the plaintiff respecting time limitations. However, in mid November 2001 the defendant's storage warehouse was destroyed by fire and the defendant lost many old records including those relating to Metro and the Maritime Motel. 2)The plaintiff's diligence is consistent with s.2(2)s focus on what is equitable. It will generally be less equitable for limitation defence to defeat the claim of diligent plaintiff than of one who has sat back on his or her rights."

c_1999skqb209.txt,"FIAT. A defendant applied for an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court, alternatively s.50 of the Queen's Bench Act, for an order requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days; requiring a report to be filed with the court as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct his solicitor; and staying proceedings until a report is filed. The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate. The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)Our civil procedure does not contemplate the trial of an issue on a person's competence to bring a lawsuit. A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act had the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding legal proceedings and would result in the appointment of a litigation guardian. This step was not deemed necessary based on the evidence presented. A stay was refused.  2)Costs incurred in defending a civil action against a person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are recoverable from the estate. 3)Queen's Bench Act s.50 did not apply.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to his costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT.

The applicants recognized that if the requested order was granted, and the plaintiff was found incompetent, this action could nevertheless continue with the appointment of a litigation guardian. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The Court was not obliged to take this step based on the evidence presented. A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act has the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding the proceedings of trial, for the simple reason that the issuance of a certificate would result in litigation guardian being appointed. This is not a case where the Court feels obliged to make this step. 2)The court should exercise its discretion to do so cautiously, only in clear cases, and only when the relief sought cannot reasonably and realistically be obtained by the applicant."
8_2009skqb54.txt,"FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick. To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG). MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent. Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference. Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced. The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process. They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money. The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process. HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed. 1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.  'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act. The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications. They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses. The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act. That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction. The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act. The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed. They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. 2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case. There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions. That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed.","FIAT: The plaintiff’s claim commenced pursuant to the Class Actions Act as am. (the “Act” or “Sask. Act”) as am and now represented by an amended Statement of Claim filed with the Court November 7, 2008. Each of the defendants and third parties applied to the Court to stay either permanently or on an interim basis, the action commenced under the Act. HELD: The Court found that virtually all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications were specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the Court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. The Court also found that without the assistance of s.6 and the other amending provisions of the Act, the plaintiff was awarded one set of costs only to be shared equally and paid within 30 days. The court found that the application to stay was premature and an unnecessary duplication of resources and expense.  1) The Court reviewed the history of the Saskatchewan class action and found that although Saskatchewan was the most appropriate venue for the certification of multi-jurisdictional class action claims, it was also the most restrictive jurisdiction in the country. 2) There were significant geographic and other scopes to the Saskatchewan action, including a far wider list of damaging “substances”, a larger group of defendants and a broader scope of causes of action. 3) It was important to note that the Saskatchewan Act was amended in 2007 to provide for a more holistic approach to certification. The Sask. action is now a no costs jurisdiction providing for certification of the national opt-out class action on an 'opt-out' basis."

Kivela, [2005] and [2006] SKCA 38 (CanlII), 275 Sask. R. 271 (R.B.) and (2005) SKQB 125 (QB). In his view, the findings of facts by the Learned trial judge were reasonably supported and there was no palpable or overriding error as was found in Coleman and Wachniak v. Saskatoon Car Town Ltd. (1986), 1986 CanLII 2987 (SK QB), 45 SaskR. 308 (QP. and Regina), 2006 SKCA 39 (QR. 271) and (2006 SKCA 36) (QA2) in the context of the Consumer Protection Act, S.S. 1996, c. C-30.1 to the facts. An appeal is not a trial de novo but an appeal on the record and must be given a high degree of appellate deference. HOUSEN v. Nikul (1991), 1991, 1991, Myrowsky v. Smith, 2005 SKQB 177 and (2004) Humboldt Society for Aid to the Handicapped (2006) and Bentley v. Humbert (2006), 2007 SKQB 124 (QS.B.). The findings and fact by trial judge, the facts and applying the pertinent provisions of the consumer protection act, SSA 1996, are of high order and the conclusions of fact are of a high standard of deference, HOUSen v.(2009 SKQB 497) is the exception to this rule. In addition, there were two other cases where a trial judge erred in allowing the Plaintiffs claim against a body corporate duly registered in the Province of Saskatchewan when it agreed to honour its warranty by repairing the transmission provided the Plaintiff bring the same to the Defendant to have it repaired.

The bankrupt estate had relied on legal advice from counsel for its creditors but had obtained other counsel by the time the application proceeded. This conflict of interest was so blatant that it demanded the removal of present counsel. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)This case may be resolved by dealing with the courts supervisory power over Trustee and Inspectors given by the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.  2)The Trustee must not be represented by counsel for a bankrupt estate.  3)The Court must consider the advantages of independent counsel where creditors are of the view that the trustee is favouring the debenture holder. The Court must also consider the role of the solicitor in relation to the trustee's duties and obligations. The solicitor should not be appointed by a trustee."

HELD: 1)Application allowed. At the time that the applicants were served with the statement of defence and counterclaim, they were not represented by counsel nor did they know that they had to serve and file a statement of defence to the counterclaim. However, immediately upon being served with the garnishee summons they contacted solicitors. The application to set aside the default judgment was made as soon as possible after the judgment came to the attention of the applicants who have explained to the satisfaction of the court their failure to defend the counterclaim. The applicants have clearly shown that they have a good defence on the merits to the counterclaim. The applicants did not delay their application to set aside the judgment so that it cannot be argued that delay will cause irreparable injury to the respondents. 2)Application to set aside guarishee summons dismissed. There has been strict compliance with s.3(2) of the Act. The affidavits filed by the applicants challenging the affidavit for garnishee summons have no bearing on whether the garnishee summons should be set aside. It is not the function of a judge to look into the merits of the case on such an application. 3)Application for payment out of monies garnisheed dismissed. Section 14(1) of The Attachment of Debts Act provides that no order shall be made for payment out of any money paid into court by the garnishee when a garnishee summons issues prior to judgment until the plaintiff has recovered a judgment against the defendant. Since the judgment has been set aside the application for payment out is premature and is therefore dismissed without prejudice to reapply.","This was an application for an order setting aside the default judgment and writ of execution issued against the applicants pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 441 and s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act.

The applicant applied to the city for a variance on the height limit to 75 feet. After the necessary public hearings the application was refused by Council.

The plaintiff claimed the creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account for a lesser sum ($2,000 on a $15,600 account). He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'. The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001. In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle. An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died. The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible. SGI initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in May 2002 claiming $17,660. The defendant contended that, if there was an accord and satisfaction, it was avoided due to mistake of fact or misrepresentation. HELD: The application for summary judgment was dismissed.

9_2002skpc30.txt,"The Crown applied for three DNA warrants pursuant to s.487.05 of the Criminal Code. Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result. The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155. The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation. 'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable. Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed. Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a). 2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations. The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable. There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking. The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out. The paragraphing format was confusing. 3)A DNA warrant application would be premature. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood. It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained. It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 487.05 of the Criminal Code for 3 D.N.A. Warrants. The Informations in Support depose that the Crown has obtained a DNA sample from the person who says she is the mother of the 19-year-old child. While it may be appropriate at some point to order the blood sample be obtained notwithstanding any parental non-consent, it is questionable whether it could be concluded at present that it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order. HELD: A DNA warrant application with respect to the child would be premature, but may be renewed in due course if the Crown is so advised. The paragraphing format used in the present applications is confusing and detracts from ease of reference and understanding. The Court is of the view that there should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father of the child and how it will negative any suggestion that the father and mother are'strangers' genetically speaking. Paragraph 3(C) does not set out the relationship to the parties of the named informant nor why the information provided by the informant is considered reliable. There is nothing from the natural mother positively stating that no other person could be the father of this child. The last page and half of the Information in Support refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the child was born. The proper inference to be drawn from the words 'associated with' is that set out in the Concise Oxford Dictionary, 10th edition (1999), viz: “be involved with”. While there may be an opportunity to order DNA analysis of blood samples, which is based on blood or other bodily substances of the alleged father and the alleged mother, the facts as alleged fall within and meet the requirements of the Code. It would appear that insofar as the probative benefits of DNA analysis are concerned, the crucial determination will be whether the father or mother have the requisite number of matching DNA characteristics; the DNA of the baby would then provide further confirmation or negation of the incestuous relationship. Given the naturalmother's allegation as to the birth father, and the latter's denial of her paternity, the information, if any, contained in the Registration of Live Birth concerning the biological father would be of assistance in providing a complete picture for the Court. The Paragrapher format used by the applicants is confusing, detracts and does not provide the proper meaning and"
e_2007skqb179.txt,"Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test. The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement. The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly.","This is an application for judicial review of a Board of Arbitration Award which held that the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a Collective Agreement in force between the parties. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The decision meets the reasonableness test. The respondent was disappointed at this turn of events and he sought to have the decision reversed. He sent a letter to the President of the First Nation University enquiring whether its Board of Governors might be asked to intervene and request the symposium's organizing committee to reconsider the matter of his presentation. 1) The respondent failed in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member. The Board made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. With respect, I do not agree. 2) In effect, the board of arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance which did not involve parties to the collective agreement. It argues that the dispute giving rise to the agreement was between the respondent and the Federation not Dr. Stonechild and the University. In my judgment, the reasons as a whole support that finding. In this respect, we find that the Employer violated the Collective Agreement and we uphold the grievance in part. [3] The respondent is a unique institution. It is federated college of the University of Regina, and derives academic authority from that association. On the other hand, it is also a signifier of the important role of post-secondary education as vehicle for fulfilling the aspirations of First Nations people in Saskatchewan and across the country. These actions are harassing and intimidating actions against this faculty member, in addition to the University interfering with his academic freedom, in violation of the FNUC Academic Collective Bargaining Agreement."

The assistant was not contacted but the respondent sent a second letter to the court enclosing a document entitled 'Affidavit' which again stated that he had not been informed of when the hearing was to take place. A telephone conference was arranged but the court was unable to contact the respondent at the set time despite numerous calls and messages from the court. The applicant now sought additional costs due to the time counsel had taken to prepare for the telephone conference. Affidavit of the respondent struck; applicant entitled to additional costs in the amount of $250. The court was not convinced that the respondent had not received adequate notice of the hearing and because he did not make himself available for cross- examination, his affidavit was struck.","The Court received a letter dated March 25, 2004 in which he stated that he was not served with the Applicant's application and supporting material.

e_2006skqb519.txt,"The Bank presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent corporation respecting assets leased by the respondent to Sweeprite. By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease. This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business.","The Bank of Montreal (the Bank) presented a motion to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent Patchrite (Patchrite) respecting assets leased by Patchrite to the Bank. The Bank had no other business except the ownership and lease to and rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way that it obtained priority to the leased equipment. The business of leasing which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was the only business of Patchrite and thereafter continued to be a significant part of its business. HELD: The Court found that Patchrite was regularly engaged in the leasing of personal property within the meaning of s.2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore it is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s3. The lease in question was a lease for a term of more than 1 year and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the Court concluded that the owner/landlord's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the bank. The issue to be decided by the Court was which of the two companies had priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) Civil Procedure Rule 48.06 and 48.08 provide for interlocutory relief from recovery order and for security for costs. 2) The respondent's interpretation of the contract and that of ABS is precisely the subject matter of the main action. These issues will only be resolved in the context of findings of credibility. Such matters do not readily lend themselves to resolution on an Interlocutory application. It is from that dismissal that ABS appeals. 3) The judge erred in striking the appellant’s affidavit from the record and in failing to consider three further affidavits filed by the appellant.

d_2013skqb59.txt,"The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant. She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse. The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year. The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail. The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time.","FIAT: The mother wants to change her residence and that of the two young children presently. The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this calendar year. HELD: 1) An application to change residence on an interim basis was granted.  2) The father is currently incarcerated. He opposes the move, and in any event wants access. This is an exceptional case. 3) The mother's move with the children would mean nothing to the children in terms of their frequency of contact with their father, or with any increased difficulties in exercising access. There should, however, be some connection maintained. That can be done through telephone access. The parties should explore with corrections authorities the prospect of communication through Skype, FaceTime, or one of the other means of electronic audio/visual communication. The mother is the only available parent for the foreseeable future. When the father is eligible to get out of jail, he will not have close ties to his children for a period approaching 2 years. There is no reasonable basis to have matters resolved in the father's favour. 4) There was a material change of circumstances affecting the children. Their mother's new relationship and her pregnancy means a new sibling will be introduced into their lives. This should be considered. 5) It appears beyond dispute that the mother has always been the primary caregiver to these children. Here, the father has been in jail since September 2012, first on remand, then as serving prisoner. He will be eligible for early release in December 2013. This defies common sense."

He deposited a security deposit and rent in his personal account and used it for personal living expenses. When the owner inquired, he caused a false lease to be provided to her showing the rental commencing two months later than it actually did; he then failed to remit some rent and was late remitting other rent. He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission. At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible. The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000. The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed. Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision. It is patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions; reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible as to set out the reasoning process of the tribunal and demonstrate a consideration of all of the relevant factors.","The applicant sought sanctions for unprofessional conduct, breach of a duty of fairness, and breach of the principles of fairness. The applicant was found guilty of five acts of professional misconduct and was ordered to pay costs of $9,980.08. HELD: The applicant's application was dismissed. The Court found that the Committee's decision was based primarily on the credibility of the witnesses and the absence of any explanation for the failure to remit the rental to the applicant. The Committee also found that since judicial review for jurisdictional error was a constitutionally guaranteed right, it was patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles that natural justice and fair play demanded an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions."
e_2002nssc20.txt,"The applicant operated commercial private billiards club with liquor licence and served bar food. The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation. The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement. The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change. There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed.","This was an application for an order to declare that the Land Use By-law of the respondent permits the operation of a licensed billiard club open to the public. The premises is in an area of the municipality known as the Village of East Hants and is subject to the respondent's land use by-laws. The applicant has operated the club since June 1997 and has had a special premises liquor license granted by the province of Nova Scotia. That license has allowed the sale of liquor, subject to certain restrictions including the following: 4) This license is for the use of members of the club only and not the general public; and 5) The change of the liquor license sought by the applicant will constitute a change in use requiring a development permit. This is against that background that the modern regime of land use controls, with their inherent tension between the owner's desire to put its own property to what it regards as the optimal use and the municipality's interest in having all of the land within its boundaries organized in plan which it thinks will maximize the benefits for all inhabitants. It is unnecessary to consider the ramifications or results of a possible change of non-conforming use."
3_2002nsca152.txt,"A supplier delivered computer books to an educational institution prior to the appointment of a receiver for the institution. Immediately after the appointment of the receiver, the supplier presented a written demand for repossession of the books. The receiver refused, claiming that the books were subject to an agreement for sale to the institution's students and therefore, exempt.  A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed. Appeal allowed; return of books or payment of their value to the supplier ordered. Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time. The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand. The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials. Thus, the books were not subject to any agreement for resale within the meaning of the Act.","This was an appeal by a supplier from the refusal by a receiver to release goods to the supplier pursuant to s. 81.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The supplier intended to use the books which had been supplied for a module starting at the end of August but they had not been distributed to the students and remained on the shelves at ITI as of the date of the receivership and the supplier's written demand in mid-August. The judge held that once ITI had decided what course materials it would use, there was a binding contract to supply those materials. He found that ITI selected the books in issue and that, therefore, the books delivered to ITI were subject to an agreement for sale. The fact that it intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide those materials and the fact that the company acknowledged that changes'may be made during the course of the student's program.' HELD: Appeal allowed per oral reasons. 1)ITI was obliged by its contract with its students '...to provide, at its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program...it is necessary for ITI to change materials from time to time' and that such changes may be made 'during the course' of the program. 2)The single issue was whether the judge erred in finding otherwise. ITI retained discretion under its contract to its students as to what courses it would supply. However, it was not obliged by the contract to provide certain materials. It acknowledged that'materials may be changed from one time to another' and such changes were 'necessary' for the school's program'. 3)The court found that the order was not'subject to an 'agreement for sale' within the meaning of s.81.1(1)(c)(v) and that the judge had not found otherwise."
4_2014skqb177.txt,"Civil Procedure – Pleadings – Statement of Claim – Striking OutCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 7-9 The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants that included three causes of action: a claim against Xtreme Mining and Banga for wrongful dismissal; a claim for defamation brought against Banga; and for inducing breach of contract against Potash Corp. The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial. The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants. Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment. The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation. The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media. HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition. Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time. It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial.","The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants, Xtreme Mining & Demolition Inc., and the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. The plaintiffs brought a claim for wrongful dismissal, defamation, inducing breach of contract, and three causes of action. HELD: 1) Rule 13-8(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules provides that the pleadings must be made in order to prove their allegation that the defendant defamed them and their evidentiary facts contrary to prevailing Canadian jurisprudence. 2) Rule 7-9(2) pleads evidence that should be struck. The facts pleaded in para.50 are material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and any resulting moral damages. 3) The defendants' references to members of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club in paragraph 67 would lead reasonable people to believe that the defendants acted unfairly or in bad faith by terminating the plaintiff's employment while he was suffering from prostate cancer. Further, these facts were material to defamation because they contain indirect quotes attributable to the defendant. 4) The Court was satisfied that the essence and spirit of the current rules do not materially differ from the former rules. 5) The pleadings of media outlets are treated with sufficient certainty, clarity and precision as opposed to actually pleading those material facts. 6) The plaintiffs plead facts which, if proven, would establish a pattern of behaviour on the part of the defendant that raises the presence of bad faith in the defendants' dismissal of the plaintiffs. 7) The application seeks the following relief: 7) Rules 13-9 (1) (c) (d) (e) (f) and (f). The Court is satisfied that these particular aspects of the claim do not directly affect the facts set forth in the statement of claim."
c_2009nssc180.txt,"At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007). Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009. The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years. The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines. She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it. The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands. Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward. The father's hardship arguments rejected. He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income. The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient. Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied. The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses. During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family.","The mother sought an order that would provide parenting provisions as to their son; child maintenance payable to her in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines in the form of table amount and contribution to special or extraordinary expenses and that retroactivity of child maintenance for the period from August 2001 to December 2007. The parties separated in August 2001. Prior to the Consent Order, there was no written agreement or court order dealing with child maintenance. The father's dramatic increase in salary was in and of itself'sufficient notice' his child maintenance obligation had to be increased. He did, on occasion, make additional payments with regard to items put forward by the mother. Hardship Occasioned by Retroactive Award [ edit ]The mother's request for retroactive child maintenance was denied by the father. The court found that the father had 'effective notice' that his current payment was deficient."
e_2017skqb99.txt,"HELD: The application was allowed in part and the balance of images found on the computer were excluded from the evidence at trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The court found that the evidence found through temporary Internet sites was admissible. The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer. The police had no authority to search the computer generally. They were only authorized to look at the Internet history. The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right. The temporary files created as a result of the visits on the Internet was evidence of Internet history, and because of this connection, this evidence was not excluded.","The accused applied to exclude certain evidence discovered by the police during the execution of the search of his computer and cellular phone. The initial determination of whether there had been a violation of the accused's s. Charter rights occurred by the judgment of January 3, 2017. The issue of exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter was not determined at that time. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The accused's computer was seized and the search warrant was abandoned right from the start. The very reason for obtaining the warrant is abandoned. 2)It is difficult to imagine a more intrusive invasion of privacy than a search of one's home and personal computer. Computers often contain our most intimate correspondence. They contain the details of our financial, medical, and personal situations. They even reveal our specific interests, likes, and propensities. This information never found its way into his report. The presence of this potential corroboration evidence obviated the need for the search history information. 3)There is no evidence on this trial that the accused had any discussions with any other officers prior to completing his analysis of the computer. While protocol has changed, in July 2013, he was not required to review the warrant or ITO as part of his analysis. The evidence from the voir dire was forwarded to Cst. Logan for review and determination. In the alternative, the accused seeks to exclude those images not automatically cached by web browser during an internet search. 4)There are several problems with this evidence. The first is the negative impact of admission of the evidence on the repute of the administration of justice, but the impact of failing to admit the evidence. 5)The second problem is the absence of any evidence of the complainant's presence on the accused’s computer. The only evidence of her presence was that of a laptop computer. This is particularly the case where, as here, the computer is used to browse the Web. The Information to Obtain [ITO] in support of the warrant sought only search of the internet history. There is no indication in the evidence that picture or pictures of anyone who might be the complainant would contain those “hash values.” This information was not included in the ITO. 6)The third issue is whether the admission of evidence obtained by a Charter breach would bring the Administration of justice into disrepute."
c_1994canlii4958.txt,"The Plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from the Defendant. He accidentally injected one of his fingers with paint. The finger had to be amputated. He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.  1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type. It operated at 2,500 lbs. pressure. This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user. The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn. 2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor. Where an enterprise or activity is inherently dangerous, the duty to warn can not be delegated. In such a situation the party who retains the independent contractor remains vicariously liable. 3)The waiver in the rental contract was ineffective. It was a standard form agreement signed on its face with the terms of the contract on the reverse. 4)The Plaintiff was awarded general damages of $10,000.00, $5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and recovered $3,789.50 for SHSP. 5)The usual increase in general damages for inflation and pre-judgment interest were both reduced because the Plaintiff had not presecuted his action expeditiously.","At issue is the defendant's potential liability for failure to warn the plaintiff of the danger in using an airless paint sprayer. HELD: The plaintiff's finger was amputated after he injected it with paint from a sprayer rented from the defendant. 1)The plaintiff was bound by term of the rental contract which stipulated that liability for injury caused by the operation of the equipment shall be that of the Lessee. The plaintiff had no reason to be scrupulously careful about the position of his finger because he was unaware of the waiver term. 2)There was no evidence that the delay in the decision made any difference, and in particular, it was not shown that earlier amputation would have saved more of the finger. 3)The defendant was not liable for the damage suffered by the plaintiff as a consequence of the plaintiff's negligence in allowing his finger near the spray nozzle. 4)Costs and pre-judgment interest were limited because the plaintiff ought to have brought the matter on for trial more expeditiously."

6_2011skqb386.txt,"The tenants were given short written notice to vacate their apartment unit. The tenants applied under the Residential Tenancies Act for the return of their security deposit and damages including moving expenses. The landlord was out of country at the time of the hearing but authorized by letter that the caretaker would attend the hearing to represent the landlord. The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment. The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement. The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision. The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable. HELD: The landlord's appeal was dismissed. 1) The tenant gave notice of his claim by two separate documents and the landlord showed no misapprehension of the tenants' position based on his written response. The landlord did not indicate in his letter that the caretaker had a limited role and the landlord could have sought an adjournment but did not.  2) Section 70(6)(c) of the Act empowers the hearing officer to order payment of damages where the hearing officer considers it just and equitable. The wording of this provision is broad and unconstrained excepting that the nature of damages that may be imposed must not be punitive. The decision on rent abatement was principled and to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space. The award for moving costs was intended to compensate for inconvenience, aggravation and related expenses. The awards were reasonable both in fact and law and no reviewable error was made by the hearing officer. Corrigendum released dated November 15, 2011 and added to fulltext.","The landlord appeals a decision rendered by a hearing officer under The Residential Tenancies Act. The issue before the hearing officer concerned the tenants' claim for damages and return of the security deposit arising out of the landlord's notice to vacate. The tenants reluctantly accepted termination even though it was short notice and thereafter applied under the Act for the return of their security deposit and other damages. The landlord contends he was not given opportunity to be heard, or to adequately respond to the tenants’ claim. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)The hearing officer erred by failing to give the landlord an opportunity to respond. The tenant failed to properly identify which area of the unit was unusable, failed to describe the relief sought or the nature of argument they intended to advance. 2)The tenant’s strategic miscalculation does not amount to an error on the part of the Hearing Officer. The decision on rent abatement was made on a principled and logical basis having regard to the facts. The purpose of the award was to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space. The award for moving costs was intended in part to compensate for inconvenience and aggravation, and in part as compensatory loss for related expenses. Both awards were reasonable on both fact and law, accordingly. The hearing officer found no reviewable error by the officer."
9_1998canlii12399.txt,"The issue on appeal was reduced to whether the security holder, Lanson, authorized Nickel to sell the mobile home as contemplated by s28(1) or, if not authorized, did he sell the mobile home in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s30(2). Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.  HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security. 2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer. The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.  6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","The issue on this appeal is the priority of security interest in a mobile home granted by the respondent to the respondent and subsequent purchaser for value, the Credit Union having regard to the operation of s. 28(1) and s. 30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. HELD: The respondent's security interest continued to take priority over the respondent's. The trial judge concluded that Lanson did not authorize the sale of the mobile home within the meaning of the P.P.S.A., and the sale did not occur in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s.30(2). The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor does not invalidate the sale to the buyer. The appellant relied heavily on Canadian Commercial Bank v. Tisdale Farm Equipment Ltd., which was restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor that he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secure party. The fact that the debtor did not pay does not mean the sale is invalidated."

In issue was whether the home was a homestead within the meaning of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act when s.44(17) was proclaimed on September 20, 1992. HELD: The application was adjourned to June 7. 1)The homestead provisions of s.44 had no application in this case. The land was not being put to any farming use prior to August 1992 and the respondent's house at the time fell into the category of 'simply a dwelling in isolation' (Bank of Nova Scotia v. Blair). 2)There was no recent appraisal information available.

The amount owing on the mortgage dates back to 1988. The current certificate of title still shows the Farm Credit Corporation as second mortgagee in the amount of $36,000. HELD: The application is adjourned. 1)There is no recent appraisal information available with respect to the property. The respondent's house on the property fell into the category of what Gerein J. in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Blair referred to as'simply a dwelling in isolation'. 2)Aside from the length of the redemption period and the upset price that should be included in any order for sale, the issue is whether the land was not being put to any farming purpose during that period. The evidence submitted by the respondents to date does not do this. 3)The respondent has not established that the land in the period prior to August of 1992 met the definition of farm land. The farm credit corporation fell into that category. To be homestead, there must be a bona fide farm residence and the land on which such residence sits must be used for 'farming purposes'. 4)HELD: There was no recent appraisals available. 5)The Court considered it reasonable to adjourn the application to June 7, 2001 at a time to be set by the local registrar.

The 1997 income information was not included because the financial evidence was insufficient. 15% of the capital cost allowance was imputed pursuant to s19 for the 1994-96 taxation years. Deducting all of the respondent's capital cost allowance was not a reasonable expense.

No City employees were working on the site. ISSUES: 1)Is the picketing secondary picketing? 2)Is the manner of picketing unlawful in any event? HELD: Application allowed. 1)Picketing of the premises of an employer, where there is no direct dispute between him and the picketers or between him and his employees, is secondary picketing, is per se unlawful and cannot be jusified merely because the picketers are engaged in a legal strike against another employer who has business relations with the employer being picketed. 2)If the court had determined that the subject picketing was not secondary picketing, then, in the particular circumstances it would still have held that the subject picketing was unlawful, and ought to be restrained, as, on the whole of said evidence it was satisfied that the applicant had established that said picketing was not being carried on for the purpose of lawful communication, but, rather, was being carried on in a manner designed to obstruct, impede and interfere with the lawful performance by the applicant of its construction contract on the construction site.","The plaintiff sought an interim and interlocutory injunction restraining the defendants from entering the premises of the plaintiff and prohibiting them from interfering with the plaintiff's lawful use and improvement of the premises.

5_2008nspc12.txt,"A youth was arrested and charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle after the vehicle arrived near the location of a pre-arranged drug transaction. The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear. A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized. The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive. There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search. This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person.","A young person was charged with having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking, crack cocaine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The strip search was lawful and there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter. In the event of a Charter breach, the evidence would nonetheless be ruled admissible. HELD: The evidence sought to be excluded was 17.8 grams of crack cocaine. It was real, non-conscripted evidence which existed irrespective on any Charter breach. The search was conducted as quickly as possible and in a way that ensured the loss or destruction of drugs. Significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person."
9_2014skpc205.txt,"There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility. The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment. The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent. The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister. Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication. It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s.271 of the Criminal Code. The charge arises from sexual activity that occurred between the accused and the complainant in December 2012. The complainant says that she has no memory of the sexual activity due to an alcohol induced blackout. The Crown argues that there was no consent. The accused does not deny that he had sex with the complainant. He claims that the activity was consensual or alternatively, that he lacked the mens rea for sexual assault. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court heard contradictory evidence with respect to the central issue of consent, which is to be assessed in light of all the evidence having regard to the principles established by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Ewanchuk, 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991] 1 SCR 742. While the complainant's testimony is the only source of direct evidence as to her state of mind, credibility must still be assessed. It is open to the accused to claim that the complainant’s words and actions, before and during the incident, raise reasonable doubt against her assertion that she did not want the sexual touching to take place. If the complainant did not consent, did the accused have an honest but mistaken belief in consent?"

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There is a real and substantial connection in this case to both jurisdictions. 2)The plaintiff's primary cause of action revolves around his loss arising from what he was was negligence in the manufacturing and inspection of the aircraft parts. 3)The Court must be taken to have accepted that its product may ultimately cause injury to its customers. The Court must also consider the location of prospective witnesses, location of evidence and the effect those factors will have on the convenience and expense of the trial."
5_1997canlii866.txt,"The plaintiff had an abortion at a Halifax clinic. The plaintiff was in the recovery room for 30 to 45 minutes after the procedure, and then left. On the drive home, she was injured in a motor vehicle accident when she fainted and her car crossed the centre line of the highway and struck another vehicle. She sued three members of the clinic staff, including the doctor who performed the abortion, alleging negligence in letting her drive after the abortion. Awarding the plaintiff $724,000 for past and future loss of income, future loss of pension, and general damages, that based on the evidence of the possible complications from surgery such as an abortion, and considering the emotional impact of an abortion on all women, the defendants breached their standard of care as health care professionals in permitting the plaintiff to drive after the abortion.","HELD: The Court held that the two actions would be heard together because of common issues involved and that the assessment of damages would be held at a later date. The Court found that the defendant did not exist and was simply listed as a defendant by mistake. The plaintiff's evidence on liability was admitted as follows: 1) the defendant was not aware that the plaintiff was permitted to drive home after having an abortion. 2) the plaintiff did not have a babysitter for the night. She was aware that she was driving home alone. 3) The defendant advised against driving after an abortion whether it was done under general anesthesia or regrading occupation hazards following administration of the drug. If there were obvious signs of impairment to the plaintiff's ability to drive, she should have taken the sedative immediately after the abortion. She did not want to be seen by her husband or children. 4) The court found that there was no recognized risk to the health of the plaintiff or her family as a result of the accident. The defendant was negligent in failing to notify the other health care professionals of this fact. The court ordered that the Court consider whether the plaintiff should have been allowed to drive or not."
e_2007skca122.txt,"This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","This was an appeal from a decision of Madam Justice Rothery who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant against the respondents, Bjorkdale Lions Club Inc., and the defendants. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The appellant suffered burns of varying degree to various parts of his body including his hand and arm. He was burned when gasoline from the gas tank located behind the driver's seat of the vehicle he was driving splashed on him and was set on fire shortly afterwards, after he had signalled his desire to have the contest halted and his vehicle had come to stop. The damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2)Had the case been permitted to go to trial, the jury could have concluded that either of the respondents caused or contributed to the extent of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the respondents as on the appellant, and the damage could have been seen to be caused by the respondent. 3)The respondent's failure to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he observed would have resulted in less serious burns than he would have suffered. 4)The evidence was taken for the purposes at hand to have established the damage was caused by both the respondent's actions and the actions of the flagman and the fire department. 5)The court could not rationally have concluded either the respondent caused or caused the damage attributable to the appellant or the respondent, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would not have suffered as serious burns as they turned out to be. 6)The issue was whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence."
b_2011skqb219.txt,"The applicant is a residential unit owner in the condominium corporation. He sought a declaration pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 interpreting the bylaws of the condominium corporation with respect to the voting rights of the commercial unit owners. The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units. The remaining 29 units are residential. The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors. A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders. The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board. HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw. There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners. Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting. The proper interpretation of the bylaws has nothing to do with the principles of contract interpretation. The application was dismissed. The interpretation of the bylaw by the Board of Directors was reasonable and that Court was not prepared to interfere with it.","The applicant, a residential unit owner, brought an application against the Condominium Corporation, its board of directors and the owners of three commercial units seeking relief pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The applicant was entitled to nominate up to three persons for election to the Board and to exercise their right to see them elected but were not entitled to vote on the election of the remaining four positions on the Board. There was no specific provision in the bylaws that would allow such an interpretation resulting in such a restriction on the commercial owners' voting rights. 2)Rule 319 of the Queen’s Bench Rules was applied pursuant to Rule 319. 3)The application was allowed because the applicant had obtained legal opinion as to the interpretation of the voting provisions of the bylaw."

d_2013skpc56.txt,"The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","The accused was convicted of possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, possession of a weapon for the purpose of trafficking and failure to comply with a youth probation order for failing to attend a youth court meeting. The accused was sentenced to six months deferred custody on all three counts. The Court found that with this not being a violent offence and with his limited criminal record, the accused was not subject to custody under either s. 39(1)(d) or s. 38 of the YCJA. HELD: 1) Clearly, his previous sentence of probation as imposed by Judge Tucker on August 20, 2012, based on a conviction of possession for the use of cocaine, had failed to promote his rehabilitation or his reintegration into society. The amount of cocaine that the accused had possession was significant. The role of the accused in the trafficking operation - in this case the evidence would seem to indicate that Mr. L. was the one and only person involved, although one would certainly suspect the driver of the motor vehicle knew what was going on. 2) The accused had a lengthy criminal record and had served time in custody for drug trafficking offences. He had served nine months pre-trial custody and had sold in excess of $10,000 worth of heroin on 13 different occasions. He was only one month into a custodial disposition when he was back in La Ronge selling cocaine. 3) The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the prime motivation behind the drug trafficking operation was financial gain. The most aggravating factor that has the potential to move this offence into the exceptional case category is the fact that the Court was only 1 month into the probation order and had been bound by the terms of that order, which included a mandatory prohibition order, that he was to stay out of the Province unless he had the permission of the Court, and that the Crown did not want the accused coming back to the community to sell narcotics. 4) There was little to no evidence that this activity was designed to feed an addiction to cocaine."
5_1998canlii13934.txt,"Landlord and Tenant - Writ of Possession_____ The landlord applied for an order for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The 41 month lease required a monthly rental of $500 for the first five months and thereafter semi-annual payments of $5,000. The tenants had not paid any rent in 1998 nor had they maintained insurance; they installed alternating stalls in the barn in breach of their covenant not to make any alterations or additions to the premises; breached the express and implied covenants to keep the premises in good condition and tenantable repair by their failure to remove and properly dispose of baler twine, to maintain proper weed control or to remove manure buildup in the calf barn. The tenants admitted the rental payment was due in May but claimed the landlord breached the pre-condition wherein Russell's husband promised to repair the damage caused by a 1995 hail storm. The claims for repair was far in excess of those provided for in the lease which were the tenant's responsibility._____ HELD: 1)The landlord was entitled to a writ of possession since the tenants were in breach of the covenant to pay rent for more than two calendar months. 2)A trial of the issue was ordered to determine whether the tenants were in breach of covenants in the lease. The matter should not be decided summarily where there are questions of fact or law. The hail damage may allow the tenants to claim in damages against the landlord but it could not be construed as a debt due for the purposes of s27 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The remaining alleged breaches could not be determined summarily.  3)Costs of the application were awarded to the landlord in any event of the cause.","The landlord applied for an order for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of The Landlord and Tenant Act. The respondents entered a lease in 1995 with Russell and her now deceased husband with respect to land legally described as Section 30, Range 6, West of the Second Meridian (""the land"") together with the buildings on the land including house, barn and granary and equipment except for the hail damage to the house siding and shingles on the barn addition which shall be replaced by the Lessor. HELD: The application was dismissed. Where there are questions of fact or law the matter should not be decided summarily but should bedecided in an action (Vogelgesang and Kennedy v. Williams, 1981 CanLII 2300) and the Rules of Court generally will govern the conduct of the action. 1)The payment due May 1998 was not made because, they allege, Russell has breached the lease(clause 5.2) and because there was a failure to maintain proper weed control. The MacFarlane's were in arrears of rent by more than 2 months. 2)The hail damage may allow the MacFarlanes to claim in damages against Russell but it cannot be construed as a debt due for the purposes of s27 of the landlord and tenant's lease. 3)The issues with respect the hail damages were far in excess of those provided for in clause 3.1 of the lease."
3_2000skqb75.txt,"The applicant sought to vary the 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing spousal support of $2,500 per month. The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP. Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed. HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.  2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension. 3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions. However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home. She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property. The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge). There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs.","The applicant applied to vary a February 1, 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing his obligation to pay further spousal support. The amount he was required to pay under the 1995 judgment was $2,500 per month. He was unemployed and no longer received the substantial salary that he had enjoyed. The respondent was now over 65 years old and received Canada Pension and Old Age Security benefits. HELD: The applicant met the threshold for a variation application by demonstrating that there had been a material change in circumstances since the 1995 order. The applicant was granted leave to apply for variation application in couple of years when the status of his employment income will be known. There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. Although the parties had separated, the economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account. A trial of the issue was ordered.  1)It is significant that the agreement reached by the parties in 1995 did not provide for a time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in the future financial position of the parties. 2)The parties had three children and the respondent had retired from the matrimonial home. Although she had some employment income during the marriage, she now qualified for Old Age Pension benefits that are currently $417 per month and her retirement savings including those that represent his pension will be depleted by the year 2011. 3)Although it is obviously not the law that appropriate Spousal Support levels are determined by equalizing the incomes of couples who have divorced and their respective needs and means, it is essential that the parties know now what their future obligations will be.  4)The applicant had no employment income at the time the agreement was made. He now earned $9,000 per month from his Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) and his Canada Pension Plan benefits. 5)The respondent was over 65 and received her proportionate share of the applicant's pension benefits. 6)The application was limited to the amount that she now received from her Old Age pension and her Canada Pension. 7)The court found that there was no material change to the circumstances in which the respondent could increase her monthly income by taking in boarders or selling her home and purchasing some form of annuity. 8)The Court found that the respondent was disadvantaged to a greater degree than the applicant. 9)It was significant that both the applicant and respondent were married for almost 29 years. The parties had 3 children."
c_2002skqb47.txt,"FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store. The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43. The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused. The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to. The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party. 2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages. 3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value. Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. Expenses of each was examined separately. In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant. 4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee. A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court. It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant. Costs payable by the plaintiff on an interlocutory application may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs.","FIAT The plaintiff was injured when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the defendant's store. The trial did not commence until November 27, 2000. The defendant served an offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs. The offer was not accepted by the plaintiff. HELD: 1)Taxable court costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. The amount expended by party for investigating or gathering evidence to either advance a claim or defend it may actually exceed the value of the claim. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. A second counsel fee is allowed at 50 percent of the first counsel fee. 2)Costs are in the discretion of the Court and are limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. It is appropriate in this case to reduce by 50 percent the plaintiff's costs taxable under Schedule 1""B"".  3)The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in the first case. There was considerable “down time” between many of the expert medical witnesses. One lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty. That, however, could not have been known in advance. Maximum fees will not be granted to second counsel solely because that person is a senior member of the Bar. Need, rather than experience, forms the basis for fixing the amount of fees."
4_2004skqb516.txt,"The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search. The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid. That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2) The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued. The search was therefore warrantless. 3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair. 4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis. 5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.","Cst. Olberg applied for and obtained two search warrants pursuant to s. 487 of the Criminal Code and s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The search of the accused's residence was the culmination of an investigation that concerned alleged illegal cross-border drug trafficking between the United States and Canada. These investigations were outlined in and the subject matter of two Informations to Obtain the Code and CDSA Warrants. HELD: The evidence satisfied that there was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The Court found that the evidence seized by the search was non-conscriptive within the meaning of s. 24 of the Charter. The absence of any malevolent intention was commented upon because of the bearing that it may have upon any Charter analysis that may need to be undertaken."
5_2011nspc8.txt,"The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea. He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son. The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography. Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed; the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault. The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation.","This was an application by the accused to set aside his guilty plea to count #1, the sexual assault of his son. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The accused was not fully aware of the nature of the allegation to which he plead guilty nor his understanding that he, by his plea, was admitting to it. 2)The fact that this was part of the accused's motivation for pleading guilty does not alter my view of his knowledge and understanding of the alleged offence. He admitted to that allegation. 3)The Court was not persuaded that the accused had not seen the video of the complainant's statement to the police although it had been disclosed to his lawyer. 4)The facts of the offence to which the plea of guilty relates to the impact of the plea on his ability to have contact with his son are not credible. The accused's not having seen the videotape of the statement, nor that a language/communication issue prevented him from having a full understanding of what the allegation of sexual assault is."
b_1998canlii12364.txt,"The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult. The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue. The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult. The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989. The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court. The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision. It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court. Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges. If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth. The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.  2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application. R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.","The accused was charged with two indictable offences over a period of seven years. At that transfer hearing, the entire issue of when the offences occurred can be examined and the choice of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges can be made in the absence of the requirement to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court judge was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court to be heard according to law. The primary issue on this appeal is whether the youth court judge should have assumed jurisdiction after he found the alleged offences could have occurred when the accused was either a young person or an adult. The Court considered the effects of the transition provisions in the Act and in particular s.79(4) in R. v. B.(K). The Court reviewed the circumstances of the case and found that the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, a youth court, as opposed to an ordinary court. It also considered whether the Crown should apply for a transfer hearing under s.16 of the Act to determine whether the accused's alleged offences occurred when he was a young offender or adult. It would appear there are no adverse consequences to applying for an order under s16."
d_2010skqb173.txt,"The petitioner and respondent are the parents of twins. The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order. The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent. The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner. The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children. The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis. The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come. The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children. HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement. The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order. The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased. The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed. The respondent was awarded costs.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to vary the consent parenting judgment and the consent child support order. The respondent opposes the application and says there has been no material change of circumstances since the granting of the parenting judgment in February 2007. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The petitioner has not satisfied the court that a material change has occurred. The original parenting judgment contemplated in detail the parenting arrangement that has been followed. However, the petitioner has failed to meet the onus upon him in this regard and the application should be dismissed. 2) There has not been any material change in the circumstances of the children since the last parenting judgment. The petitioner's 2009 income for child support purposes was $77,060. The court dismissed the petitioner's application to vary. 3) The respondent has not shown material change to the children's welfare in the past 3 years. The child support payment as set out in the February 2, 2007 order at $762 be changed so that the $762 payment would not increase or decrease in the years to come. 4) There was no change of circumstance as the petitioner had increased costs now that he had the children 50% of the time. However the cost of the parties' relocation costs was dealt with in the original order."
7_2001skqb10.txt,"The divorce action was based on separation for more than a year.  In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)Divorce was granted. The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998. 2)They agreed to joint custody of both children. The son was to reside primarily with his father. The daughter resided with her mother. Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends. The children were to be together most weekends. School vacations would be shared. 3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance. Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense. The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance. 4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003. The mother's job advancement was impeded as a result of the marriage, specifically by frequent moves to accommodate her husband's job transfers. She had worked out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing. 5)The parties agreed the matrimonial home would be sold and proceeds divided equally after payment of expenses of the sale. Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale. The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.  6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage. It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000. The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded. The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000. All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition. RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover. 7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75.

The petitioner sought adjustments for some maintenance and repair costs incurred after the marriage and with respect to part of orthodontic treatment expenses. HELD: 1)The respondent was ordered to convey one-half of the commuted value as of the petition (½ of $21,804.38 = $10,902.19) to a locked-in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. This is the maximum amount transferrable in accordance with the Pension Benefits Act, 1992. The difference of $2,764.

The mother was to deliver items to 17, inclusive, in the list of chattels set forth in Exhibit P-3 at Tab H. 4)The father was to convey 1/2 of the amount payable on each and every month commencing January 1, 2001. 5)Each party was to share the children's time during school vacations. 6)Spousal support was to be reviewed in the meantime on the ordinary ground of material change in circumstances, should such occur."
2006nssc158.txt,"The parties, who were the parents of two children, separated after a seven year marriage. For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis. In the divorce proceeding, the mother, who planned to remarry and relocate, sought to become the primary caregiver of the children, with the father to have access only every second weekend. The father sought to vary the parenting time so that both parents would equally share their time with the children. Current parenting arrangement to remain in effect with the parties retaining joint custody of the children; table amount of child support set. The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base.",The mother petitioned for divorce and sought to have the father's parenting time reduced. The father sought to vary his parenting time so that he and the children would equally share their time with the children. The parties lived separate and apart for more than a year prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The mother sought spousal support and the father agreed to become the primary care giver for the children and for the father to have access to take place every second weekend. HELD: The court ordered that the current parenting arrangements remain in effect with the exception of the change regarding Remembrance Day. There was no evidence presented to support a conclusion a change was necessary nor would improve the parent/child relationship.  1)The father's relocation will not create a significant change in the children's schooling or their relationship with the adults in their life. 2)The mother indicated she plans to remarry and relocate and seeks to have time the children spend in Mr. Thomson\'s care reduced.  3)The parents are farther apart on this issue than indicated in the Pre-Trial Memorandum.
2_2009nssc364.txt,"The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008. It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time. At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).","The parties married in 1995 and separated in 2006. They have four children. The parties have effected division of their former matrimonial property. The respondent has suffered a dramatic drop in income and is no longer in a shared parenting arrangement. HELD: The Court will consider the spousal and child support obligations of the respondent and whether they are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgment. The principal basis for the respondent's argument is (1) a significant reduction in his income, and (2) a loss of income tax deductibility for his payment under clause 9 of the separation agreement. The Court found that the respondent had not entered a binding agreement or that the agreement was not binding at the time it was entered."

On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court. The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources. On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004. HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed. 1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months. This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence.",Paddy Lemaigre applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. There was no Charter breach and the application was dismissed. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. 1)The accused suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking he was subject to prevented him from contacting the complainant and it was therefore argued that he was prevented from having access to his children in her care. 2)The Court found no actual or inferred prejudice. The conditions of release he is subject to are not soerous as to result in any significant prejudice to him or to infer that he has suffered prejudice over and above that suffered by others charged with similar offences. 3)There was no evidence of any efforts by the accused to overcome this prejudice. This prejudice is something that the accused could overcome.
c_1996canlii6728.txt,"Issues included the division of a pension, child and spousal support and whether to transfer or have sold the matrimonial home which had a small equity. The petitioner was an undischarged bankrupt and any funds in his possession belonged to the trustee. The only marital asset of any value was the petitioner's pension but lump sum payment was not available for five years as there was a liquidity problem. The parties had been 'spenders' not 'savers'. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support for one child. 2)Spousal support was denied. 3)The matrimonial home was to be sold and proceeds were to be divided equally.  4)Three values were suggested for valuation and distribution of the pension plan. The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method. The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP. The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP. The respondent was to make the choice between the only two options. If she wished to have the funds in her name immediately, she was to provide written notification otherwise there would be an order that the respondent is to receive a portion when the monthly pension benefit commences.","HELD: The court ordered a division of the petitioner's pension, the quantum of child support and spousal support and whether the matrimonial home should be transferred to the respondent or sold and the proceeds divided. 1)The petitioner was an undischarged bankrupt. The husband had already reached the earliest eligible retirement date but had not retired. The parties were'spenders' not'savers'. Through the circumstances of the debts and the husband's bankruptcy, the parties were spending heavily on their car. The wife's primary asset was the respondent's pension. She was employed throughout the marriage and contributed the income earned to support the family. Although the husband had a car available, the wife was unable to make any payments on it due to a previous back injury. 2)The court ordered the husband to pay child support of $260 per month for the 21 years of marriage and $350 per month thereafter for so long as the child was a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 3)The wife was to pay the husband child support as child support for the husband for 21 years.

c_2013skqb180.txt,"The parties had a shared parenting arrangement since separation where each party parented their four-year-old child for equal times in a two-week cycle, the petitioner parenting in her home in Moose Jaw and the respondent parenting in his parent's home in Regina. The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school. Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent. The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application. The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents. The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child. The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make. HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child. The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent. The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents. The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's. Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan. The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain. The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina. The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime. The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend. The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays. The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two. The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year. Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days. The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement.","HELD: The court held that the parents could not resolve the issue and defer to the court to determine where the child's primary residence was and where she would attend school. The court found that there was no prospect of reconciling between the parties as the child was already pre-school aged and the parents had separated when she was only four years old. The child was to commence school on September 1, 2013. The inevitable decision was imminent. The parents had regard only for the best interests of the child and for that purpose, the court applied the same law as it did in making an order for custody of a child under the age of four."

The plaintiff claims that the spreader was entirely unfit for spreading compost and did not meet the warranties imposed by The Agricultural Implements Act. The plaintiff claimed judgment for the purchase price and damages for repairs to the spreader. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The plaintiff did not establish that the spreader was not fit for the purpose of spreading compost or that it was not manufactured in compliance with the warranties in the Act. 1) Other than the fact of a chain breakage on two separate occasions, there was no evidence produced by the plaintiff addressing the cause of breakage. 2) If deficiencies did exist in the spreader, the dealer or distributor are expressly entitled to an opportunity to repair or correct the deficiencies, upon receipt of notice in writing.

d_2011skqb62.txt,"The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon. The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon. The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed. The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon. The Crown appeal was dismissed.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the accused on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon on the grounds that the learned trial judge misapprehended the evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. The Crown submits that the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence and seeks conviction. HELD: The Crown's appeal is dismissed. 1) There was no evidence upon which the Crown had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to use the sword as a weapon, or that the sword was a novelty sword. No attempt was made by the Crown to call evidence to contradict his testimony. 2) The trial judge relied on the accused's evidence that he had just purchased the sword and was taking it home to display in his room or on his television. On this basis, she concluded that the evidence was relevant to the trial judge's determination with respect to the usual use of this type of item.  3) The Crown must start with the premise that a knife, being an instrument that is universally used for utilitarian, peaceful purposes is not prima facie a weapon. A knife, like a multitude of other things (e.g. baseball bats, hatchets, pipe wrenches and ice picks) can on occasion be used effectively in fighting offensively or defensively. There is nothing to show that the knife in question was designed to be used by a weapon: when it is closed, it is as innocuous as any other type of weapon. The judge properly placed Mr. Maguire's evidence in the context of the issues she had to address. 4) The accused testified that he bought the sword from someone named 'Froggy'. As he had no bag or back pack in which to carry it, he tucked it into his shorts. He cannot recall whether he was alone or with someone. The officer drew his firearm and instructed the accused to place his hands on his head. He slowly lay on his stomach, with his hands out to his sides. He had a strong odour of liquor on his breath and slurred his speech. Under cross-examination, the accused gave further evidence about the sword. He was aware that it was readily available in novelty stores and that it had been of interest to people as decorative item. The accused was not testifying as to his eye witness perceptions but about where it could be purchased."
b_2006skqb183.txt,"The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years. The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","The plaintiffs sued for damages arising from alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the golf course and for a permanent injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: The plaintiffs were awarded injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which had been ongoing for the past nine years. The Town was ordered to pay $18,000 for loss of use and enjoyment of their property for 7 months of the year and $6,000 to settle the claim by Bosenberg and Strassburg who continue to have the same problem. 1) The plaintiffs refused to accept either of the recommendations in the report. 2) The defendant optionor could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiff's claim for damages against the defendant was dismissed. 4) It would appear that the defendants have advanced no expert evidence to support the proposition that the golf balls hitting from the adjacent golf course are a nuisance and continue to be a nuisance. 5) There is no doubt that the present operation of Emerald Park Golf and Country Club is a nuisance, and continues to be so. 6) The defendants' failure to comply with the plaintiff’s recommendations did not constitute a continuing nuisance. 7) There was no evidence that the plaintiff anticipated the extent of the existing problem. The plaintiff was not prepared to rely on expert evidence or the recommendations of the various course managers as to how this would affect his or her property."

The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years. The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal. The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision. HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted. 1)The application was premature. The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months. The Court of Appeal was not satisfied the appeal as a whole was not frivolous having regard for the requirements of s.679(3)(a) and (c). Some grounds for appeal would clearly fail such as the ground the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess on the basis of the incomplete material before the court. 2)His continued detention was necessary in the public interest having regard for the whole of the circumstances.

In 1998, this Court dismissed his appeal against his conviction and allowed the Crown's appeal, increasing the sentence from 5 to 10 years. In the meantime the applicant wanted to be released from custody. HELD: The application for release was premature. The Court was not satisfied that the prospective appeal as a whole was not frivolous and that the applicant's continued detention for the time being was not necessary in the public interest. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess in their entirety given the material before me. On the basis of that material, which is incomplete, I am not convinced the grounds relied upon have sufficient merit to satisfy the requirements of clause (a) of the section. Moreover, the Supreme Court is not satisfied the prospective appeals as a package are not frivolous. The prospective appeal is likely to be determined in the next 3 or 4 months. The present release of the applicant would be inimical to public confidence in the administration of justice given the history of the past proceedings, the current state of the present proceedings and the potential for the applicant to succeed either in having all of the convictions set aside or in having the sentence reduced to the time already served."

It is alleged that the erection of the sign violates the Town's Municipal Planning Strategy and Land Use By-law. The limiting measures of the by-law are rationally connected to the objective and it effectively addresses unrestricted use of available space in a way that maximizes the effective use of signs.

The restrictions regulate how and where the signs can be placed and does not prevent advertising, but only limits it. The Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. Costs will be awarded at $1,500 against all respondents. 1)It is clear from Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec A.G. (1989) 1 S.C.R. 927 that advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of s.2(b) of the Charter. 2)Limits on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter are demonstrably justified pursuant to ss.2 and s.3. The town conceded that the bylaw limited freedom of expression, and described the infringement of certification as a'minimal intrusion'. 3)The Town was also ordered to issue an order directing the respondents to remove their ground sign if not removed within 15 days. 4)The town's objectives were to develop and maintain a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown core zone, minimize adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reduce safety concerns such as distractions that affect both pedestrian and vehicular traffic."

The applicants challenged the decision of the Labour Relations Board as being patently unreasonable and that the word removal as found in s43(1)(c) read separately or in conjunction with the remainer of the section could not reasonably be interpreted to include closure of a business or part thereof so as to constitute a technological change within the meaning of s43.

The matter was remitted to the Labour Relations Board to be dealt with having regard to the finding that the closure of the vacuum division is not a 'technological change' within the meaning of s43(1)(c) of the Trade Union Act. 1)The Board made a patently unreasonable error. The issue had been settled by the decision in Regina Exhibition.

The court allowed certain of the amounts claimed, essentially legitimate cost items relating to the sale amounting to $7,522.95, but allowed a number of items of damage, including all legal costs and fees incurred in the Maclnnes et al action, to be considered.

6_2003skqb61.txt,"FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate. Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not. To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).","FIAT: This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year-old mother is opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of a bond. HELD: 1) This is a routine application by siblings, who are most usually the applicants, and to consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for a bond contained in s.55(1) of the Act. The court has heard submissions that some bonding companies are requiring five-year premium payable in advance on the basis the risk is too great for a one year premium. In many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets which equal or exceed the value of the estate to be administered. The four children who are not applicants consent to the application without a necessity of bond. 2) The application to be appointed personal decision makers is in order and an order may issue with the authorities identified in the draft order submitted. There have been enough defalcations by previous property guardians, which is why it was given a larger role to play in the new legislation. Leave is granted to the applicants to supplement the existing material should they see fit to do so. If the applicant is from out of province, or was not beneficiary under the dependent adult's will, or if there was opposition within the family to the appointment, then the court application may be brought. 3) There is a cost associated with involving the public trustee as a property guardian in the estate of the subject adult. The onus is on the person making an application for property guardianship without the necessary of bond to persuade the court that it is appropriate, bearing in mind the object of the legislation which is to ensure that the money in this estate is always available for the adult's ongoing care. The public trustee should be consulted in advance of the court's application being served as to whether there is any common ground on the type of surety that would be acceptable, including the financial disclosure required to support the same, or to determine if the court is prepared to consent to it. Leave to consult with the Public trustee in advance will certainly eliminate significant costs for the applicants in having to litigate every application with the trustee."
6_1999canlii12377.txt,"A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second. Two passengers were knocked unconscious. One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty. His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances. The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield. The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision. It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.  1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3). The right of way, however, is not absolute. As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor. It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on. Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor. Alcohol was not a factor. Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights. 3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","This was a charge of failing to yield contrary to s. 50(3) of The Highway Traffic Act. The defendant was proceeding north on 15th Avenue when he stopped at an intersection for several south-bound vehicles to go by. Before turning left, he saw another vehicle approaching from the opposite direction, this one a 1987 Ford Tempo driven by Adrianna Wormworth. HELD: 1)The defendant was entitled to assume that it was safe to do so, as there did not appear to be any other vehicles close enough to the intersection to present a hazard. 2)The court found that the defendant did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary drivers faced with similar circumstances, and that with respect to the failure to yield, the defence of due diligence was established. 3)The evidence of the drivers and their passengers and to all of the circumstances did not suggest a reasonable amount of skill in the handling of a vehicle which is a potential source of danger to other users of the road. The vehicle probably approached and entered the intersection too fast for the defendant to take appropriate evasive action. It means that if vehicle has the right to proceed, then it must be allowed to proceed first."
c_2007skqb269.txt,"FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school. They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed. HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case. 1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case. The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity. There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council. There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided. No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election. The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding. The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made. To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process. 2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair. A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter.","FIAT. The applicants sought an interlocutory injunction preventing and restraining the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution passed by the Wilcox school community council on May 7, 2007 that the school be closed effective August 15, 2007. HELD: 1) The respondents failed to comply with the requirements of procedural fairness in the manner in which they proceeded to pass the resolution closing the school. There was no evidence or suggestion a different school council would have been elected if the extra two days notice had been provided. 2) A preliminary review of the facts and law do not suggest a strong prima facie case."

HELD: The application was dismissed with costs in the amount of $500 to the petitioner. Neither the petitioner's father nor the petitioner's husband was a party to the proceedings. To require them to produce their financial records, in the absence of even the slightest evidence such production would disclose anything which would in any manner assist in determining the amount of child maintenance payable by the petitioner, would be totally unjust.","FIAT The issue of child maintenance was adjourned pending fulfilment of the requirement that the mother produce all information relating to her ability to pay maintenance and for her examination by the respondent to determine her income. The examination was completed and the questions to be resolved were whether the mother had produced all relevant financial information, and whether a trial should be directed as to the amount of maintenance payable by her. HELD: Both applications were dismissed with costs of $500 to the petitioner. The mother had not provided any evidence to support her assertions that she earned more income than the amount revealed in her income tax returns. Neither the father nor the petitioner had canvassed the financial records of the trucking corporation owned by the mother's husband to determine their income. Neither would they have canvassed their father's books of account to assist in establishing that his income was more then the amount disclosed in her tax return."

Prior to the commencement of the hearing, defence counsel was aware that the Crown did not intend to call this person as part of its case. One month prior to the preliminary hearing, defence counsel requested that the accident reconstructionist be made available as witness. The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission. The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing. HELD: The defence request for an adjournment was granted. The Court could not be satisfied that the officer was not a material witness to the preliminary inquiry. The Court was not satisfied that defence was guilty of neglect in failing to procure the officer's attendance when they had been advised by the Crown that he was out of the country. The length of the adjournment would not be lengthy.","The accused was charged with committing an offence under s.254(5) of the Criminal Code and knew or ought to have known that his operation of the motor vehicle caused an accident resulting in bodily harm to another person. After the Crown called all of their witnesses on the preliminary inquiry, asked Defence Counsel if they had any witnesses to call on behalf of the accused. Defence Counsel advised that they had one witness they wished to call but required an adjournment as that witness was not available to testify on this date. HELD: 1)The accused's charges were first laid in 2009 and shortly thereafter he was elected trial by Queen's Bench Judge without jury. The inquiry was set to July 26, 2010 and Case Management hearing was set for May 4, 2010. 2)There is a reasonable expectation that he can be procured on the adjournment date and that such adjournment is relatively short in duration. 3)The defence was not guilty of neglect in procuring the attendance of Sergeant Barbar. He was present at the accident scene and took measurements, made notes and did some calculations. The questions and answers from that meeting may be very material to the accused's state of mind or knowledge at the time he refused to comply with the Intoxilyzer demand or speak to whether there is a casual connection between his alleged impairment and the bodily harm."
e_2014skpc35.txt,"The Crown found the accused not guilty. With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address. The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary. Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence. There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 259(4) of the Criminal Code. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The officer observed an individual operating a motor vehicle and observed that the person was the registered owner of the vehicle and that the officer warned him that if he lied about his identity, he could be charged with obstructing a peace officer. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1)Although there was no identification of the accused in court, the officer identified himself as the accused and admitted that he was prohibited from driving. This constitutes prima facie proof of identity and the Court has no doubt whatsoever that the Tyler D. Hoover named on the Appearance Notice is the same person who has stood trial. 2)The Certificate of Disqualification or Prohibition was not admissible in evidence. The Court could not rely on s. 260(5) to establish that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel."
e_1999skqb106.txt,"FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","The plaintiffs allege that one or more of the above defendants carried on a negligent and reckless helicopter shuttle operation to and from the work site. The plaintiffs allege the defendants knew the helicopter transportation was unsafe, and allege that the Cameco group of defendants cannot avoid liability by reason of having hired an independent contractor. Questions related to the e-mail system are properly answerable. HELD: The applications to be considered seek better discovery both testimonial and documentary. Questions directed at when the project was over-budget are relevant with respect to the issue of transportation. Questions on the availability of alternative forms of transportation, the cost of such alternatives, the dependability of the alternatives and the safety of the airliners are all relevant. Answers to all of these questions are logically relevant to the choice made by one of the defendants because they are factors one would expect any decision maker to take into account in deciding a specific form of transportation and are also relevant to test the credibility of answers that may be provided by the corporate officers with regard to the reasons for the choices made. If the plaintiffs wish to know when the helicopter shuttle service was performed, such information is broadly relevant. If not, leave is granted to reapply for direction. The Court found that the plaintiffs were entitled to know the date the helicopter was put on the air and the time it was placed on board, but not the date it became operational. Further, the Court allowed questions on the topography of the area between the base camp and the mine site, and the location of the road between the two sites are relevant not only as background information to the scene of the accident, but also in support of the plaintiffs' allegation that the helicopter is inherently dangerous. The questions directed at the E-mail System are properly answered."

She also sought a division of assets under the Matrimonial Property Act. HELD: The Court had jurisdiction to vary the consent order upon the grounds of fraud, duress and unconscionability notwithstanding that s.29 of the Act does not specifically provide the Court with jurisdiction. The Court found that the Court had the jurisdiction in this matter to vary a consent order made pursuant to Part 1 of the Order. Since the Ontario court order purported to finalize a property division between the parties, the plaintiff, who claims a portion of the defendant's pension entitlement, seeks to set aside the agreement she made with the defendant.

In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck. HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.  2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears. Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997. The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997. Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times. Upon payment of $5,000 the balance of arrears accrued prior to December 31/98 would be extinguished. 3)The father was to pay child support of $325 per month for the two children. Garnishment of his wages by the Maintenance Enforcement Office were to be limited to $175 per month for arrears plus the current maintenance due. 4)The parties agreed the father should have access not less than one full weekend per month upon two weeks prior notice plus when he was available to attend at the city in a manner consistent with the children's best interests and their need to be available for school.","The respondent sought an order varying the child maintenance payable by the respondent by reducing the monthly monthly rate from $250 to $250 with the view of providing him with greater access to the children. HELD: 1) The respondent was not prepared to hear her application and advised her to apply by notice motion with appropriate supporting affidavits. 2) Both parties were restrained from removing the children of the relationship from the Province of Saskatchewan without the written consent of the other party or an order of this Court. The respondent's gross annual income for the years 1996 to 1997 was sufficient to enable him to pay child support under the order. However, he was not in a position to pay the full monthly maintenance provided by the Order and therefore was not able to reduce the arrears accrued during such period. 3) The petitioner's gross income was $22,993. It was agreed that the respondent should have access not less than 1 full weekend per month between 6:00 p.m. on Friday to 6:30 p. m. on Sunday upon two weeks prior notice together plus other periods of time when he is available to attend at Saskatoon for the purpose of exercising access in a manner consistent with the best interest of the children including their need to be available for school. 4) The parties agreed that 1) the child support should be reduced to $325 per month based on his 1998 income and would have been $437 per month for the year 1998. Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to the variation of maintenance payable prior to 1996. 5) There was no evidence the petitioner had access during any of the years 1993 to 1997. 6) It was not appropriate for the respondent to have access on the terms heretofore stated. 7) The terms of the Family Maintenance Act s.10 (the Act) did not deal with the issue of access. 8) It is not appropriate to impose conditions on the access of the respondent. 9) The father was not available to answer the court's questions as to access. 10) The mother's income in the years 1997 to 1998 was $21,974. The father earned the following gross annual incomes: 1993 $10,552. 00 1994 $11,685. 00 1997 $33,494. 1998 $30,548. 1999 $22993."
d_2001nssc18.txt,"The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave. The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.","This was an application for judicial review of the decision of a labour arbitrator released on July 21, 2000 in respect of a grievance arbitration heard in Sydney, Nova Scotia on May 10, 2000. The arbitrator found that the wording of Article 9:01 is wide enough to encompass this situation. The person with the less hotel seniority was the one who should have their hours reduced, not me. HELD: The appeal was granted. 1)The arbitrator’s conclusion was patently unreasonable. It was as indefinite as if there was a reduction of hours overall within the department. This interpretation also adheres to the long held principle that “the purpose of seniority is to afford preference to senior employees in recognition of length of service” and preserves the purpose of departmental seniority. 2)The respondent union had a grievance against the hotel based on its interpretation of certain seniority provisions of collective agreement between the parties. It argued that the interpretation of the arbitrator was not even argued before her. 3)The arbitration concluded that any reduction in work hours should instead have been predicated on hotel level. This was not a layoff situation. Rather, it was an indefinite reduction in hours within a department which was not the situation here at all. 4)The appellant was the first to experience reduction of work hours in the front desk department where she placed fourth on the departmental list behind the other three employees. The appellant had the benefit of working additional hours in her department during the maternity leave. She therefore filed a grievance on February 17, 2000 seeking to have the hotel set aside under s15(2) of the Arbitration Act."
b_2014skca82.txt,"The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed. The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony. The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed. The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous. The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial. The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial. The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial. Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondent from a charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to s. 249(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown was tried on this charge before judge alone and was acquitted on October 10, 2013. For the reasons that follow, the Crown would dismiss the appeal. HELD: 1) The Crown failed to overcome the heavy onus required to overturn appeals from acquittals under s. 676(1)(a). 2) The trial judge did not confuse the factual issue of the appellant's speed with either the actus reus or the mens rea of the offence. 3) It was an error of law for the trial judge to confuse an issue of fact—Mr. Alves' speed—with either of the actuses reus.  4) The evidence of several witnesses who testified that they were walking their dog near Circle Drive at the time of the accident showed that the appellant was travelling at a much faster speed than he was. The trial trial judge correctly stated that speed is not an essential element of the criminal offence. It was not a matter of fact that the accused's speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. He simply misunderstood the issue.  5) It is not necessary to prove a significant fault element is required in order to establish dangerous driving for the purposes of the imposition of criminal punishment. 6) The Court of Appeal was not satisfied that the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that the manner of driving of the accused was dangerous to the public in all the circumstances."
2001skqb148.txt,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","The defendants brought a motion pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188 to have the plaintiff's claim dismissed. They also sought an order extending a limitation period nunc pro tunc. The plaintiff had a prima facie case and had commenced this action fifteen months after the stay of proceedings was entered. Dismissing the motion, that the Court of Appeal rule provides for a determination of a point of law and that the limitation period should only run after the application for leave has been made. Even though the applications are grounded in a limitation time, there still is a factual component and absent an agreed statement of facts there should not be an order granted under Rule 188. The remaining substantive issues were whether the action was barred by a statutory limitation period, whether any limitation period was extended, whether there was an allegation of malice, whether the plaintiff had commenced an action in tort against the defendants because there was no evidence of malice and whether a portion of the claim failed to disclose a cause of action. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The court found that the limitations period was not an insurmountable obstacle in the way of making a nunc-tunc order. 2)The Court found that when a statute-barred action is entered, it must be addressed fairly. 3)Rule 188 of the Public Officers' Protection Act was struck down. The Court did not find that the provisions of s.2(1)(a) of The Public Officers Protection Act (PSPA) applied to this action. The provisions of the PSPA do not apply here. Rather, they provide a mechanism for the Court to determine whether a particular action is barred by statute or not. 4)The application for an order, if necessary, extending the limitation time was not addressed in this case."
b_1996canlii5058.txt,"The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act. The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David. First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity. When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate. Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application. The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due. Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas. The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment. Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due. 5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose. It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation. There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.","Whether money owed under a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) is a debt 'accruing due' under the Attachment of Debts Act or subject to garnishment cannot be determined by reference only to garnishability of promissory notes not yet due. Other cases pertaining to similar debts must also be rationalized. In the case of the garnishee summons, the court found that the debt owing under the GIC was not a conditional one and made so by reason of the possibility of assignment. The court also held that garnishment was prevented because the debt was a conditional debt and made 'a conditional one' within the meaning of s. 5(1) of the Act."
e_2007skqb174.txt,"The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","The father applied to vary the original Custody Judgment to allow him to have sole custody of the child. The mother opposed the father's application to be allowed to change the child's primary residence to Whitehorse. HELD: The father was granted sole custody and the mother was granted less restrictive access. The court reviewed each of the seven factors listed in Gordon v. Goertz and found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances at the time the father applied for joint custody. The father had been granted interim custody in June 2006 and requested an order allowing him to relocate with the child for residential purposes. While the mother had opposed both applications at trial, she now indicated that she was willing to work towards joint custody and shared parenting once she demonstrated that she could be trusted not to attempt to abduct her child. There was no evidence that the father had changed his residence in Yukon since the mother's return to Saskatoon, although she had indicated that he had made the necessary inquiries and that his employment prospects there were good."
9_2004skqb324.txt,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","Walgreens applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing the orders of the Board made on May 21, 2004 and June 24, 2004. These orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in a subpoena duces tecum, and to make disclosure and production orders in the manner in which it has done. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)A review of the transcript is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must, in this case, be considered part of the record. The fact that the Board conceded that two exceptions must be made indicates that this is a case where the exceptions to the general rule apply. 2)The Board acted without jurisdiction by compelling the applicant to discover documents in contravention of the previous rulings of the Saskatchewan courts. The Board did not address the necessity of reviewing the transcript to consider each aspect of the breach of Charter allegations. 3)The application was brought by the interests of the parties. The parties were seeking to have the applicant's application for discovery and production dismissed. 4)The applicant was seeking the production of documents that were irrelevant to the issues that were properly before the Board. The applicant was also seeking the discovery of documents referred to by the respondent in the subpoenas tecum. The respondent had refused to supply the respondent with copies of the affidavits. 5)The respondent failed to comply with all of the conditions set out in the order. 6)It is not possible, without the proper information and context provided by the transcript, to consider the respondent's request for discovery or production. 7)The court found that the respondent did not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure or production orders. 8)It was not possible to determine the relevance of the respondent’s affidavit evidence in light of the numerous other affidavits filed by the applicant and the fact that it was not available to the Court at the time the order was issued. It was beyond the scope of this judgment to review and comment on the relevancy of the affidavit evidence."
b_1996canlii5628.txt,"The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years. As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation. The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages. He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages. Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months. Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified. Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears. Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.","The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent with Allstate Insurance. He had been with the company for 26 years. Allstate had not, at any time, sought to justify the termination of his employment by arguing that since compensation is calculated in part on the basis of the prior month's sales, the length of service of the contract did not constitute a failure by the plaintiff to mitigate his damages. HELD: 1)The plaintiff's termination was not unreasonable. His course of conduct was not reasonable. His employment contract with the defendant incorporated a two year 'non-competition' clause which effectively increased the level of compensation on new policies written and at the same time reduced the level on renewals. 2)Had the plaintiff not acted reasonably in determining the appropriate period of notice, the plaintiff would have been entitled to compensation in the amount of $1,800 to $3,000 per month. There was no month of employment for which he was not paid. 3)Had Allstate failed to mitigate its damages in the circumstances?"
4_2010nssc85.txt,"The parties were separated and had difficulty communicating. They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three). The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50). She alleged the husband was abusive. The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children. Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times). The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded. If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that. Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan. Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation. A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.",The wife requested an equal time shared parenting arrangement. The husband requested sole custody with the children in the wife's care every second weekend. The wife alleged the husband was abusive of her. The parties had little face to face communication and the wife frequently did not respond to the husband's reasonable requests involving the children. HELD: The children were placed in the primary care of the husband. The court found that the wife was not a credible witness and a further example of this was her allegation that the husband when deployed would not allot funds from his pay directly to her while he was gone. The nature and cause of conflict between the parties must be analysed to determine if joint custody is in child's best interest.

The hotel was convicted on one charge and the remaining charges were held in abeyance pending its appeal. The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges. Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court.

e_2008skqb84.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred. There was no unfairness in the trial process. The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer. 2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case. He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen. The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v.

HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape started with Mr. Borden and was discussed and personally approved by Mr. Dubelt. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case and did not have confidence in them. He did not want to adjourn the criminal trial as he wished to have the criminal charges resolved before the family matters proceeded to hearing. 2) The appellant did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide, that came as a result of the decisions he freely made.  3) The Court found no procedural unfairness to the appellant, nor did it find that the appellant had the opportunity to change his mind. 4) In the circumstances, the appellant was entitled to have his lawyer represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. The Court concluded that the tactical decision was not based on procedural fairness but rather on the fact that the trial judge accepted the fact situation described by the complainant, and there was nothing in any of the evidence led either by the Crown or defence that he found to detract from her evidence. The objective fairness of the trial was not diminished because of the tactics of the appellant and his lawyer."

HELD: The appeal was allowed and the following ordered: a restitution order payable directly to the employer in the amount of $8,528; the six month conditional sentence was affirmed with the conditions as originally ordered plus restitution was to be paid in full at a rate of $200 per month; the period of probation was decreased to three years following the expiration of the six month conditional sentence. The maximum allowable probation period is three years and the sentence imposed was therefore unenforceable.","The Crown appeals the imposition of a 6 month conditional sentence with 45 months probation and a restitution order against the respondent for the offence of stealing money in excess of $5,000 contrary to s. 334(a). Clearly the maximum allowable probation period is 3 years and therefore the sentence imposed below is unenforceable. HELD: The Crown appeals. The sentence imposed in s.334(a) is set to expire in June 1997. The terms of the probation order are affirmed save and except condition which is amended to read: Pay restitution in the amount of $8,518 directly to the respondent.

The respondent raised a preliminary objection, arguing that the matter should not proceed by way of judicial review but that the applicant should be restricted to an appeal of the Rentalsman's decision under s.49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, and that the applicant had failed to do so within the prescribed 30 day limit. The applicant argued that she never received any notice of proceedings making it impossible for her to appeal within 30 days. HELD: Preliminary objection dismissed. The court ordered that the application be returned to the Chamber's list for a hearing on the merits. Since there is nothing in the Act that allows the court to extend the time for filing an appeal, to deny the application for judicial review would deny the applicant an opportunity to pursue her only remedy in the circumstances.","This was an application pursuant to Rules 664(1) and 674 of the Queen's Bench Rules for an order quashing a decision of the Office of the Rentalsman.

e_2006nssc364.txt,"The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle.","HELD: The plaintiff was awarded an all inclusive sum of $162,500. The figure agreed upon was the all-inclusive sum. What remains for the court to decide is whether that sum is to be paid by Allstate or by ING. The facts in this case are very much in dispute which necessitates number of credibility findings to be made. The factual disputes essentially pertain to the issues of the identity of the vehicle which struck the plaintiff, the driver of that vehicle and whether the driver had the owner's consent to operate it. The plaintiff's version of events began to unravel. His evidence was replete with inconsistencies, contradictions, admitted poor memory and admitted lies in his earlier discovery evidence. Prior to trial, counsel for the plaintiff and ING reached an agreement on the quantum of damages which shortened the trial considerably. HELD: 1) The plaintiff had no documentation whatsoever in proof of the sale of the van to Ms. Marsh. He retained lawyer to prepare a Statutory Declaration to enable him to register the ownership of another vehicle in August. What remained for the Court to decide in this unusual fact situation is whether it is To be Paid or By ING or Allstate.  2) The facts were complex and there were a number of inconsistencies in the plaintiff's evidence. The first issue was whether the plaintiff was entitled to the sum agreed upon by the parties. The second issue was the credibility of the plaintiff’s claim that he was the owner of a van that had been involved in a hit and run incident and that he had no contact with the person who owned the van at the time of the incident. He had no idea that the van was being used as the getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist and was being driven by a second individual. He did not recognize the driver from the police photo line up entered in evidence as part of the police investigation file and he did not allow or authorize him to drive his van once he was alerted to it by the squeal of tires."

At the onset of her trial, the accused took the position that her s. 8, s. 9 and s. 10 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all the evidence obtained after the stop should be excluded. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached. 1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest. 2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there. 3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.","The accused was charged with two counts of possession of a controlled substance contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and one count of assault with a weapon. The accused had been at large on her undertaking entered in before Justice and was being bound to comply with condition that she produce the necessary papers and not when the constable first approached her vehicle. At the outset of the trial, counsel for the accused took the position that the accused's rights pursuant to ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all evidence obtained after the initial stop should be excluded. HELD: The accused's right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure was infringed. The Court found that the officer, upon smelling the marijuana, then had reasonable and probable grounds to conduct a warrantless search. The evidence was excluded because it did not raise suspicions of impairment."
4_1996canlii6648.txt,The applicant sought to have the law firm barred from acting for the plaintiff because a member of that firm had been active in representing the defendant prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change in government. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors. The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff. This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.  2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern. 4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme. It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists. Also such policies may well have changed since 1992.,"The applicant seeks to have the solicitor barred from acting for the plaintiff by reason of being consistent with a previous ruling involving a similar attempt to displace the applicant's present solicitors from certain litigation then existing following the 1982 change of government. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the Respondent in any event of the cause. Much is made by the applicant of the confidential nature of its adjusting and analyzing of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. The applicant's strategy and procedures of confidential nature that is, one which could not be deduced from the pleadings and examinations for discovery by any competent lawyer. The only identifiable strategy adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications, including this one, to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation."
b_2008skpc104.txt,"The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act. There was a complaint to police concerning the accused. He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment. He smelled of alcohol. He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police. Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol. He was causing a disturbance to others. Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place. No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused. The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication. The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go. In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest. There was no such person in this case. The arrest was, on these facts, lawful.","The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code.

2_2011nsca89.txt,"The defendant, who was in a very small apartment with two other individuals, got up from the couch and proceeded through a doorway behind the complainant, purportedly to use the bathroom. A few minutes later, the complainant found something wrapped around his neck and he was choked until he passed out. When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him. She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back. The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat. Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door. Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay. When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked. She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. Appeal dismissed;  it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility. Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence. The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony.","The appellant was convicted of robbery and sentenced to four years' imprisonment. She now appeals her conviction on the single ground that the trial judge erred in law by treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not refer to the principles set out in R. v. W.(D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742. Rather, he recognized that the ultimate issue was not credibility but proof to criminal standard. The appellant's culpability for the robbery and assault had been established beyond a reasonable doubt."
b_2012nssc225.txt,",  motion denied. The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions. The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation. The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation. The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions. The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court. The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants. The court dismissed the motion.","This was a motion brought by the Respondents seeking to consolidate their claim against the Defendants, with three other actions, all involving the same defendants and allegations regarding the improper negligent conduct of an investment advisor. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1) It is not possible at this juncture to determine the degree of commonality, in what the pleadings disclose as being four relatively complex actions. 2) The pleadings clearly state each plaintiff had their own investment accounts which are subject matter of their litigation. There is no evidence before the Court to establish that the series of transactions are all part of the same transaction as contemplated by the Rule. 3) The Court is not at this stage sufficiently furnished with information about the claims to be able to make a reasonable assessment of which issues could be tried in common and which issues have to be set to be tried individually."

He challenged the admissibility of that evidence on a voir dire before an empaneling jury. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The evidence was ruled admissible for the trial. 1)The accused had consented to the analysis of a blood sample taken from a suspect for comparison purposes with a bodily substance 'found' in circumstances described in s. 487.05 (b) and that because, in this case, no such bodily substance was 'found', the evidence was admissible. 2)There was no violation of the accused's Charter rights. The blood sample was obtained reasonably and lawfully pursuant to a duly authorized and lawfully executed warrant. The Crown relied on the warrant and in the alternative, the consent of a person, for the authority to draw the blood. The manner in which the warrant was executed was perfectly reasonable.

Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim. The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents. HELD: 1) This application is based on the proposition that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applies to the plaintiffs' amended claim.

The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga. The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands. The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages. In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act. HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1.

With that, the Attorney General applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for leave to appeal on the ground the judge misconstrued and misapplied the Act and the provisions of s.19.1. 2) The court found the operation of the Weyakwin facility by the defendants without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to the Act as a whole."

The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that questions of evidence were of sufficient importance to grant leave. The applicant’s third ground was that the Chambers judge failed to take into account the interests of the public, particularly, the need to deter the public and the need to remove profit from crime to compensate victims. The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground. The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account. The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days. The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal.","The Director of the Seizure of Criminal Property Act seeks leave to appeal a Queen's Bench Chambers decision which denied his application for the forfeiture of a vehicle registered to the respondent.

HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) With respect to issues (a) and (b), the Director was not persuaded that in the context of this case, questions of evidence are of sufficient importance to engage the Court.  2) The Chambers judge was not at all sure that the Chambers judge overlooked the interests of the public or failed to consider the need to deter crime, undercut the profitability of crime and so forth. He conducted a relatively thorough review of the relevant case law in the course of establishing the framework governing his decision-making. This included Saskatchewan Director v. Mihalyko, 2009. Paragraph of his decision would suggest that the judge did consider matters relating to the deterrence of crime. To do so would narrowly cross the threshold of being draconian and manifestly unjust. 3) The Director submits that the Judge erred by considering certain information about the circumstances of the respondent and Ms. Brinkman even though that information had been submitted by those two individuals as part of their arguments rather than formally by affidavit. He was characterizing the evidence of Sgt. Pfeil as having been made on information and belief. The chambers judge was also at pains to emphasize the importance of taking into account the fact the vehicle was held for 90 days."

Although the accused was lawfully stopped, the roadside demand was valid and the accused declined to exercise his right to counsel on two occasions following his arrest, the observation period at the detachment was not conducted properly. The officer was sometimes focused on other things. As the observation period comprised part and parcel of a breath test, the breathalyzer test was not properly administered and the Crown could not rely on the accuracy of the readings.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood, and failing to call a lawyer on two occasions. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2, over.08. The evidence did not support a finding of guilt on count #1. The observations at the detachment were not properly conducted. The police officer was attending to other tasks and not focussed on the accused. The observation period was not conducted properly. The officer was actually absent for a period of time from the accused's presence. The Crown cannot rely on the presumption of accuracy and rely on accuracy of the readings on the Certificate of Qualified Technician."
b_1997canlii11437.txt,"A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis. She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her. The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics. 2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part. The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted. The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage. ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4: The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes.","Following the birth of her daughter, the plaintiff was admitted to the Victoria Union Hospital on an emergency basis as a result of a sudden onset of profuse vaginal bleeding. She was subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit where she was monitored and followed for half an hour. The plaintiff's allegations of negligence on the part of the defendant were that the likely cause of the bleeding on and after September 29, 1992 was the'retained products of conception' which the defendant failed to remove from her uterus by a dilation and curettage procedure ('D & C') which the plaintiff alleged would have remedied the bleeding which in turn would have obviated the necessity of performing the hysterectomy. HELD: The Court held that there was no evidence to support the plaintiff's allegation that the operating room nurses' notes were a fabrication of something that did not happen. The Court found that the medical records established conclusively that the hemorrhage in this case was caused by the failure of the physician to perform the D & C procedure."
d_2002skpc138.txt,"The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. He should not drink and drive.","The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand made to him by a Peace Officer pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code requiring him to provide then or a soon thereafter as is practicable such samples of his breath as in the opinion of a qualified technician are necessary to enable a proper analysis to be made in order to determine the concentration, if any, of alcohol in his blood. The accused was aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, a hard night of drinking the night before and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction, that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. On the evidence, the accused was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not blowing properly into the mouthpiece."
b_1996canlii6726.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production. If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys. A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing. The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act. The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times. On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a). 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value. It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do. If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent. There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan. The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.","FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from certain oil production properties, those proceeds now being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta, and a further order preserving the proceeds from future proceeds from those properties. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The plaintiffs had not established a'very strong probability' that grave damage would accrue to them in the future. 2)If the order should be granted, the risk to the respondents would be far greater than that to the appellants if the order was not granted. 3)The applicants failed to meet the first and second tests of prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience, but with more stringent requirements for the mandatory injunction. The applicants suggest that if the preservation order issue is made, the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable damage because the fruits of any successful litigation will be no longer available at the time the litigation comes to an end, and they suggest the liened lands will not have enough value in them to satisfy judgment."
7_2016skpc104.txt,"Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08 The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)). As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house. The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD. He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired. He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him. He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples. The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal. The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face. The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to do so was impaired and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08 and, lastly, with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in the circumstances. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The accused's blood alcohol content was over 80 mg% at the time he got out of his vehicle and approached Cst. Cobbledick. The officer noted approximately ten to twelve beer cans on the coffee table, which got his attention because the accused had told him that he had only drank six beer throughout the day. Although the officer did not specifically count the beer cans and put them in his notes, he was adamant that there were more than six beer cans. Based on the evidence, there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police officer who had engaged his emergency lights for a stop or that Mr. Lehman did not stop. The Court was satisfied the accused was drinking alcohol steadily over the hours before he drove and that his memory, and/or version of what he drank this evening and night, and when he drank it, had changed over time. Given that finding, the Court rejected the accused's contention that he was not trying to evade the officer and accepted the evidence of the RCMP officer."
2_2011nssc500.txt,"The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction. After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation. Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.","The accused was charged with two counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act for possession of crack cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The accused was arrested within minutes of the alleged events near and at the trafficking location. He was observed from an observation post less than 130 feet from the incident and from position of some elevation. Constable Marriott testified that he observed the accused stashing the drugs in the rock wall after the transaction and did so minutes before his arrest. His possession is constructive, done knowingly by him for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. HELD: Accused found guilty on both counts. 1)The evidence of the Crown was accepted. The Crown's evidence on the practices and encounters between the accused and the seller were consistent with drug trafficking practices and not consistent with any other possible explanations. 2)The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant stashed these drugs in a rock wall shortly after his arrest and that he had control of them. It was his stash that he placed in that rock wall in the minute following the transaction with the accused. The appellant's evidence respecting the cutting substances in crack cocaine as an explanation for the absence of the agent benedryl in the Burke stone was not supported by the evidence. 3)The Crown's motion for observation post privilege was valid. The Court was also satisfied that the evidence concerning what he observed of this alleged street level drug transaction was common practice in the area."
5_2013skqb237.txt,"The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety. There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop. The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device. The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer. At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood. A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings. A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them. The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused. The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook. The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one. The accused did not recall this waiver. The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty. The accused's readings were .11 and .04. The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results. HELD: The appeal was not successful. Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b). The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure. The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned. The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective. The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached. The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with exceeding 80 milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood contrary to ss. 10(b) and s. 24(2)(a). The trial was held in January 2012 and in March 2012, the accused was found not guilty of both charges. The Crown did not pursue the first count but did launch an appeal as to the second count. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge addressed the factors and correctly applied the test. The accused was not given an opportunity to consult counsel of his choice and the trial judge committed no error in finding and finding a breach of s.10(b). There was no error of law."
9_2009skqb313.txt,"The appellant appeals a demolition order pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act issued against his property. Issues on appeal was whether the board erred by considering material which had not been before city council, whether the board committed a jurisdictional error by failing to disclose evidence to the appellant prior to considering the appeal, and whether the board was biased against the appellant. HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order. The applicant is granted a 6 month period to remedy the problems identified. 1) The board complied with the directions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure had been made to the appellant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. The board has ensured that the appellant knew the case he had to meet. No error of law has been committed. 2) The appellant had all the information considered by the board disclosed to him. 3) There is no evidence of bias. Oppositely, the evidence supports the board's conclusion that the situation in the building constituted a nuisance related to the activities around the building, including the safety of the residents and surrounding neighbours. There is no evidence of bias against the appellant personally.","The registered owner of the property brought an appeal against the City of Prince Albert's demolition order. The respondent had refused to grant the respondent an adjournment to prepare his appeal on the basis that the board had not received complete disclosure of the case. HELD: The appeal was dismissed on all grounds. 1)The respondent had complied with the direction of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure had been made to the respondent of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. In this way, the board ensured that Markwart knew the case he had to meet and that no error of law had been committed. 2)The board acted in good faith by confirming the demolition order and by permitting the respondent to bring forth his written proposal. The Board acted in a reasonable and prudent manner. 3)The evidence showed that the respondent knew the situation in the apartment block constituted a nuisance relating to the use and activities surrounding the building, including the safety, health and welfare of the residents and surrounding neighbours. The board acted reasonably in confirming the order. 4)The Board acted with a reasonable intention to rectify the situation. It was not appropriate to restrict the respondent's access to relevant evidence which would have led him to the conclusion that the situation was a nuisance."
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","This is an application by the Director under the The Seizure of Criminal Property Act for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 to the Crown in Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from William Ross Butler in 2008. Since Mr. Butler filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for forfeiture order pursuant to Part II. HELD: 1) The application is dismissed. The Court found no retroactivity problem. 2) There is no evidence that the current legislative mandate reflected in the 2009 Act is prospective in operational effect and not retroactive. The Director's authority to pursue a forfeiture order must be assessed from that perspective alone. 3) The definition of 'property' and 'proceeds of unlawful activity' is defined in s. 35.1 of the Act. Both statutes contemplate an application to this court for forfeiture of such property. Both apply the same legal test and standard of proof."
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The father of one child was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support. He applied to reduce his support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under his previous order. HELD: 1) The father's decision to work only 3 months of the year and return to school is not a reasonable decision when he has a continuing obligation to provide support for his child. 2) On all of the evidence, it is the father's choice to work a minimum amount each year and, if he should return, it will be his choice to attend school and severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. 3) The court found that the father was underemployed and made a difficult decision. It was also found that his child support should be based on his imputed income of $40,000 and that he should pay the net sum of $328.00 as and for the support of his child, Stephanie. 4) It was found that Mr. Pilat had not acted unreasonably or had acted in bad faith during the family law proceeding."

At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This appeal is from an order which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board.

Whether one approaches the question from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s. 5.3, or from the context of the entire statute or from a purposive approach, the result is the same. The chambers judge arrived at a correct conclusion. Whatever the scope of the s. 42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the Board to act in respect of such matters.

1993canlii3448.txt,"The applicant sought an order for certiorari quashing a decision of the trial judge granting an adjournment and a prohibition from hearing the trial. In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial. The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify. Due to the delay in obtaining authority to serve an out of town subpoena in New Brunswick, the Crown was unable to serve the victim until three days before trial. The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction. Dismissing the application. It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code. Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment. There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.","The applicant sought an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that judge Archibald and any other provincial court judge cannot hear the Queen v. Jessome trial. The judge granted the adjournment on the basis that he had not met the requirements set out in the decision of the Queen's Bench Chambers.

9_1994canlii4844.txt,"This decision is supplementary to [1993]TWL QB93506. Applications to further divide matrimonial property and to vary spousal maintenance. The husband had declared personal bankruptcy since the date of the original orders obtained under the Matrimonial Property Act and Divorce Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to pay maintenance was reduced to $1 per month and the arrears accruing after the date of his assignment into bankruptcy were cancelled.  2)The wife's counsel requested that the court value and divide all of the matrimonial property equally notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because she might pursue a constructive trust claim for her 1/2 share as against the husband's trustee. 3)The court valued all of the matrimonial property and determined that 56% of this value should be paid to the wife, and only 44% to the husband, given amounts he had spent since the separation.  4)The court left unresolved the issue of which matrimonial assets might be exempt under the Bankruptcy Act and therefore available to the wife.","In November 1993 following trial involving the divorce of the parties, including corollary relief on such questions as spousal maintenance and the division of matrimonial property, the Court granted the respondent wife 56% of the estimated asset value and the respondent husband 44%. In addition, the petitioner filed a motion seeking a variation of the Spousal Maintenance Order made in November in light of his bankrupt financial situation and his inability to earn any income at this time. HELD: 1)The respondent's claim for set-off was allowed. The Court granted him 56% and 44% of his estimated assets. 2)The petitioner did pay the respondent $2,300 by way of maintenance out of certain barley he sold privately. The respondent claims this was in violation of the original order prohibiting the sale of any assets of the marriage without consent of the other party or the Court. The evidence supports this position so the Court awarded the respondent's share of the value of the barley to the respondent. 3)Division of property was based on asset values which were at this stage problematical and indeed by including some assets which may not be exempt in whole or in part from the bankruptcy proceedings. The petitioner required income to live on and the balance of the remaining farm lands, the parties equity in Saskatchewan Wheat Pool and grain on hand would normally go to satisfy the unsecured creditors of the respondent under his bankruptcy. When all of the assets have been liquidated and it is determined what amount is actually available for division then it shall be divided based on the foregoing analysis 56% for the respondent and 44 percent to the wife. 4)Each side shall bear their own costs."

HELD: The conditional provision was removed as time spent on electronic monitoring and post sentence efforts were considered. A conditional sentence was not available in the circumstances. The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions. The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public. The respondent had no sooner finished parole than he began to commit these crimes.","The Crown appeals a conditional sentence of two years less one day imposed on the respondent after he pled guilty to the following charges: breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing theft. The sentencing judge noted the respondent's alcohol problem, his three and one-half years of sobriety and that the respondent did so well on probation he was released early at his own request in December of 1999. She further considered a positive pre-sentence report and the fact the respondent spent time on remand. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. 1)When one reviews the record it is easy to understand the position taken by the Crown which is for penitentiary sentence. The Court noted the community support for the respondent, his education, and technical trade training. 2)The community disposition was likely to be more effective than the one that was presented to the Crown. However, the Court failed to consider the community's need for rehabilitation. 3)The respondent is 38 years old with 49 prior convictions.

SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The defendant sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 requiring the plaintiffs to post security for costs in this action on the ground that Wind Power Inc. was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan and Dove Industries, Inc. while a corporation was incorporated specifically for a wind power demonstration project which did not proceed (and which is related to the subject matter of this action) and accordingly had little or little assets in Saskatchewan. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants had not proceeded with an application at an earlier stage of the proceedings as it wished to provide an opportunity at the pre-trial conference stage for the matter to be resolved. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)There are appropriate circumstances to deny the defendant an order for costs at this stage. In the exercise of his discretionary discretion, the Court would dismiss SaskPower's motion. 2)The plaintiff shall have one set of costs of the application in any event of this kind. 3)The court was not advised of the plaintiffs position and held the matter in suspense before resorting to the present application. 4)Rule 547 is not code which confines the court's jurisdiction to those areas particularly mentioned in the rule. The common law has not been supplanted entirely by the rule and the court is still permitted to invoke its inherent jurisdiction to regulate its own procedure.

The notice arrived at the post office on a Friday, the day after the period expired and was picked up by the administrator the following Monday.

HELD: The appeal was allowed. The board of revision was directed to hear and determine the assessment appeal. 1)The Committee did not err in deciding the prescribed time period for an appeal could not be extended.  2)The less formal expression 'to give notice to' as used in the Act is a less exacting term than 'to serve notice upon'. Wascana Energy exercised its right of appeal properly, or at least effectively, requiring the board of revision to entertain the appeal.","The question in this case is whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly, or at least effectively, having regard for the governing provisions of the statute and the fact of how and when notice of appeal was given. HELD: The appeal from the decision of the Committee will be allowed with costs as usual and there will be an order directing the board of revisions to hear and determine the appeal. 1)The legislature said nothing of the possible effects of timely posting but untimely receipt of notice. That being so, and since the period could not be extended in the absence of power of enlargement in the statute, the Court held that the appeal could not possibly be entertained. 2)The phrase'may give notice in writing' must be taken by implication to allow for notice to be given by means of registered mail. Were it otherwise, an administrator, having received notice by registered mail within the allotted time, could lawfully decline to act upon it on the footing the property owner had failed to give notice."
3_2002skca102.txt,"The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure. In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible. She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself.","This appeal is from an order made by a Queen's Bench judge prohibiting McMurtry from continuing as trial judge in respect of criminal charges against the respondent Herzberg. The respondent was charged with impaired driving, driving with a blood-alcohol level exceeding.08 and dangerous driving. He moved for a stay of proceedings on the ground that the Crown had failed to provide adequate disclosure. In response, the Crown filed an affidavit to show that disclosure had been made. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The appeal must be allowed. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court, whether composed of judge and jury or a jury alone, does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the grounds of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. 2)The Crown did not have to disclose to the trial judge any indication of a criminal record. 3)There is no law which guarantees that inadvertent, inadmissible evidence will not be introduced.

The plaintiff sues the defendant, claiming a bonus for the 2004-2005 year and the 2005-2006 year. HELD: The claim is dismissed. In law an agreement to come to an agreement is not enforceable. This is especially true where an essential term regarding remuneration has not been agreed to. The parties agreed that they would settle on the bonus amount later on but they never did. The plaintiff believes he is still entitled to a bonus. The Court cannot make the agreement for the parties.","The parties signed a handwritten agreement on the 20th day of October, 2004. The contract was to cover feeding and maintenance of one hundred and one cows to be boarded at the plaintiff's farm.

He sent monthly invoices to the plaintiff who paid them as they got to pasture. No bonus was paid for the 2004-2005 year or the 2005-2006 year. Benson testified that the reason the amount was left blank in the contract was because neither of them were sure what it should be. He testified that later on we were going to set the price but it never happened. He had heard that some people were charging seventy dollars per calf but he felt he couldn't charge that much. He never sent a bill to Dobson because he didn't know what to charge. He also testified that people in our community don't send bills, we go over to people's places and settle up."

The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of. HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted. The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party. There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer.

6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. 25 of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. The respondent granted a residential mortgage to the respondent in January 2011, securing a loan in the amount of $460,000. This loan was consolidation of existing debt. Part of the debt was the balance of $373,089.00 owed on an original loan, which had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. At that time, the balance owed had grown to $536,186.72. However, the net sale proceeds were not sufficient to satisfy the loan and the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of the LCRA and held that the amount owed should be $162,675.99. Hrynewich Holdings accords with the policy behind the legislation as set out in this judgment. The decision in Andrew (CA) is also instructive when interpreting the spirit and intent of the s. of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; the respondent is entitled to take out the deficiency judgment against the bank; the issue is the proper amount of the judgment.  1) The appeal is allowed because the respondent was the controlling authority in this case. It is instructive to determine how the proceeds of the sale be applied against the mortgage balance, and b) what is the correct amount of deficiency judgment. 2) The respondent was correct in its previous decision that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to the purchase money and non-purchase money portions. It was not followed that the proceeds from the judicial sale must be distributed pro rata between the purchase, non, and purchase money balances. The court considered the principles set out by the Chambers judge in Andrew. This amount was calculated as follows: The portion of the loan attributable to purchase of the land was 64.03% ($93,700.48). The remaining $87,711.00 (approximately 19.03%) represented purchase money debt. The purchase money portion of this amount was $536k. At the time of the Chambers hearing, the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sales proceeds were paid to the applicant. The applicant was entitled to recover the balance owing on the purchase and to sue for the balance.  3) The Chambers Judge considered s2 of the ss.25 and the right of a mortgagee to bring action against a mortgagor only"

Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home. HELD: 1)Relocation was neither foreseen nor reasonably contemplated by the judge making the original order. The threshold criteria was thus satisfied. 2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence. The child had a close relationship with both parents. The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed. 3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied. If the mother proceeded with her move a revision of the access provision would be appropriate. 4)The child's best interest is the proper test to be applied (Cote) having regard to the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon. 5)The applicant became aware in early June of the mother's intention to move to British Columbia and did not object.

In the alternative the applicant sought an order preventing the respondent from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. HELD: 1)While there is no legal presumption in favour of the custodial parent, her views are entitled to great respect. There has been an existing custody arrangement for almost three years. The applicant concedes the respondent is a good mother and there is nothing to suggest relocation was either foreseen or would have been reasonably contemplated by the judge who made the initial order. However, there was nothing in the affidavit evidence that suggested relocation was likely either pre-judgment or contemplated. As a result the trial of an issue will be required. 2)The applicant was prepared to embark on fresh inquiry into what is in the best interests of the child. The threshold criteria is satisfied. 3)The child has a close relationship with both parents, however that only scratches the surface in terms of the relationship between the child and each parent. There was no evidence the applicant raised an objection to the move and indeed his affidavit suggests he did so. 4)The threshold criteria are satisfied. It is clear from the material that the child became aware in early June of the respondent's intention to move to British Columbia. The inquiry does not begin with legal presumption but rather a determination of the effect of a disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal from the community. The question is whether the inquiry can be conducted on the basis of affidavit evidence before the Court."

The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","The plaintiff/defendant sought reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it says were required because of the failure of Roper Ltd. to perform the contract.

The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases. The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale. The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata. As at November 1, 2017, the principal and interest owing on the non-purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,250. The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment. It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage. The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro rata calculation for the nonpurchase portion of the mortgage, that is, 8 percent of the total costs incurred.  HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to a deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested. It was also entitled to judgment against the mortgagee for eight percent of the solicitor-client costs, condominium fees and property management charges.","FIAT.

e_2016skca29.txt,"HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal the decision of the summary conviction appeal court pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. HELD: Leave was granted, the appeal was allowed and the conviction of Constable Power entered in the Provincial Court is reinstated. 1) The Court reviewed the jurisprudence regarding s. 25(1) and 34(1), and found that the force used by the respondent in the execution of his duty was excessive on an objective basis. His reasons for this decision were to disregard the evidence of the appellant and to err by applying the wrong standard of reasonableness. 2) The trial judge did not err in his assessment of the evidence and the trial judge's reasons for his decision. Rather, he did err in considering the nature and extent of the assault, the harm sought to avoid, and the characteristics of the parties involved in terms of size, strength, age and other immutable characteristics. In assessing whether there is an air of reality to the proportionality requirement, that is whether the responsive force was no more than necessary in all of the circumstances, the judge must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. He should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force use with exactitude. The Court in Nasogaluak also stated that the appeal court judge fell into error and misinterpreted s. 34 of the Code. 3) In determining whether force is reasonable in all the circumstances a judge must first consider the nature, extent, and impact of the impact the force had on the victim. In this case, the appellant's belief must also be reasonable on the basis of the situation he or she perceives. It necessarily follows that verdict of not guilty must be entered. 4) The court found that it was common ground that the principles set out in the Code governing the use of force for defensive purposes or the exercise of powers of arrest apply to police officers."

The police arrested the accused and found a fob that operated the locks on the doors of the vehicle and the engine hood of the accused's vehicle was warm. The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges. The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous. The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.","HELD: The accused was found not guilty of both charges. The court excluded evidence that was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied the accused's right to be free from an unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence of the fob and keys further weakens the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.

d_2013skqb90.txt,"The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","This is an appeal from a Small Claims Court judgment dated August 20, 2012. HELD: This appeal is dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 1) The trial judge's comments and interventions did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the court and was of sufficient clarity so that the trial judge could understand it. As Hancock was self-represented, more questions of him were required than may have been appropriate or necessary in a traditional civil trial. The proper test is whether his conduct denied the defendant a fair trial or gave rise to reasonable apprehension of bias. 2) There is no palpable and overriding error regarding the calculation of damages and the Court would therefore dismiss this ground of appeal as well. 3) In this case, had the state of the foundation and/or the wooden beam not been covered by the interior wall built by the Richardsons, the defect in the foundation, which included not only the rotten condition of the beam but also the cracks in it, could have been discovered by Hancock or his property inspector. While there was uncertainty about the timing of the broken concrete grade beam, Mr. Aubin testified that rotten triple-ply beam had been problem for over ten years. There was no evidence that the amount of work done was not necessary to repair the damage done when the foundation caved in and water entered the basement.  4) In the case of Kitzul v. Ungar (1991), 1991 CanLII 7678 (SK QB), 90 Sask.R. 239, [1991] S.J. No. 24 (QL) (Q.B.), the Court reviewed the law regarding trial unfairness in the civil context. It is clear from the case law that trial judges do not rest mute. They are entitled to, and must, seek appropriate clarification and give direction and, in certain cases disclose tentative conclusions as means of ensuring proper understanding of the case."
4_1994canlii4625.txt,"At trial in Provincial Court, the accuseds called no evidence and were convicted. They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance. 2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds. 3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.","The Crown and the appellants argued that the evidence adduced by the Crown was insufficient to such a degree that the trial judge's verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Court either unreasonable or one that cannot be supported by the evidence and, on the basis of Yebes v. The Queen, 1987 CanLII 17 (3d) 417 (S.C.C.). HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)Circumstantial evidence of opportunity was sufficient to sustain a finding of identity beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The Court of Appeal did not make a substantive error in law. The procedural point raised was not supported by substantive evidence. In either case, the Circumstantial Evidence of Opportunity is sufficient to support a conclusion respecting the cause of the injuries beyond reasonable doubt without resorting to medical opinion.  3)In either case the procedural point was supported in part by the fact that the appellant had failed to present an argument first when there was no evidence called by them."

Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L.(3d) 345 (S.C.C.) and found that marriage and child care responsibilities hinder a wife's role in the workplace. The court awarded $4500 per month as spousal and child support, plus an additional $500 while the wife retrained. The court considered this an appropriate case for an unequal division of matrimonial assets in the respondent's favour.

HELD: The Court held that the Court was satisfied that the ground had been proven and granted the petition for divorce. The Court found that there was no possibility of reconciliation as the respondent sought to have her share of the assets and debts be removed. The court also found that the 'needs and means' test is not exclusive to the 1985 Divorce Act and that it is not appropriate to require the respondent to perform more than she has agreed to do."

8_1994canlii4691.txt,"The landlord applied for possession of residential premises after his tenants refused to vacate in response to a written notice to vacate. The deputy rentalsman ordered that the landlord should have possession, but also ordered that the last two months rent would abate in order to assist the tenants with their moving costs. The landlord appealed the abatement of rent and a chambers judge reversed the deputy rentalsman. The tenants sought and were granted leave to appeal the chambers judge and this appeal resulted. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The chambers judge could only reverse the deputy rentalsman if he exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law. 2)The deputy rentalsman had jurisdiction to order an abatement of rent pursuant to S.47(4) of the Act. 3)The jurisdiction is a discretionary one. The court will therefore show some deference to a decision of the rentalsman involving this jurisdiction. In this case the deputy rentalsman made no reversible error.","The issues in this case began long before the notice of termination of tenancy (which ultimately prompted this Court's involvement) and stem from a number of complaints made by both the tenants and the landlord. The landlord began leasing his premises to the tenants. The tenants applied first to the Rentalsman's Office early in 1994 for an order directing the landlord to do certain repairs and maintenance. On the same day the landlord served the tenants with a notice of the termination of rent, the deputy rentalsman heard them in two separate hearings and had access to Matheson J.'s written judgment. The Deputy rentalsman's decision on the landlord's application for possession was rendered May 13, 1994. This decision displays the animosity which continued to exist between the landlord and tenant. There is no longer a full re-hearing on an appeal from the landlordsman's decisions. On this basis, some deference must be shown to those aspects of the landlord’s decisions which reflect an exercise of discretion. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the rentalsman was restored. 1)The Deputy Rentalman had a discretion to determine those cases where an abatement of rent is appropriate. 2)The Court was restricted to finding an error of law or jurisdiction.  3)Where the application is made to the landlord, the appellatejurisdiction of the Queen's Bench is restricted to a finding that the Court of Appeal did not err in law. The jurisdiction previously given to Rent Appeal Commission has not been given to the Queen”s Bench. 4)The court reviewed the various differences between the landlords and tenants over the course of two hearings. The differences arose, in part, from the tenants’ reasonable complaints, they must have arisen in part from such complaints. The Court was not able to find precisely the reason why the landlord wanted to remove a particular clause in the tenancy agreement but chose instead to refer the parties to the appropriate provisions in the Residential Tenancies Act."

Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head. In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration. Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment. In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment.

Shares in joint names were divided equally. Other assets were divided equally. 4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits. The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date. The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner. 5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income. $600.00 per month per child was awarded.  6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse. The petitioner's future plans were realistic. $800 per month until June 1, 2001 was awarded for spousal support.  7)Costs including one-half of the cost of preparing reports and pension valuations were awarded to the petitioner.","The parties agreed on the divorce based on their separation in excess of one year and that Mary be granted custody of the children with reasonable access to John upon reasonable notice. While the liability of the respondent to pay maintenance for the children was not disputed, the parties were not fully agreed as to the quantum of the maintenance and the division of matrimonial property. HELD: The amount of maintenance was to be based on the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Guidelines and the respondent's gross yearly income as determined by the court was $53,000.00. 1)The respondent was to pay $600 per month per child. This amount was in the ballpark and while somewhat below, is close to the amount recommended by the Guidelines. 2)The parties had investments valued at approximately $15,000 at the date the action was commenced. The parties were to have a marriage of an approximate duration of 15 years. The respondent indicated during his testimony that even if Mary had received more than he did, he did not intend to pursue his claim for equalization of household goods. 3)There was no consistent approach as to which valuation method should be used, presumably because of the varied factual circumstances in the cases presented to the Court. 4)The Court was persuaded that somewhere in between (preferably the midpoint) the termination and retirement method is the route to go."

3_1999canlii12362.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction of sexual assault causing bodily harm on the ground the trial judge erred in preventing cross-examination of the complainant. The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother. The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter. The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her. The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment. The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person. The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history. HELD: Appeal allowed. The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex. The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred. The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant in respect of the same assault is obvious. That question has a direct bearing on her credibility.","The appellant was found guilty of having sexually assaulted the complainant contrary to s. 272(c) of the Criminal Code. He appealed the conviction on the ground that the trial judge erroneously interpreted s. 276 of the Code to prevent proper cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered.  1)The trial judge failed to allow this cross-examining to take place. The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant is obvious. It does not raise the issue of whether the complainant has 'engaged in sexual activity'. This being so, N.M. should have simply been directed to respond to the question, not so as to permit an assessment of the respondent's previous sexual conduct, but to clarify what previous complaint she may have made about this alleged assault. That question had a direct bearing on her credibility. 2)The failure of the trial court to allow the cross examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence.  3)The respondent was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather about a previous complaint of a sexual assault which had not been acted upon. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not resulted in the dismissal of the charge.

The date was found to be earlier than November 26, 1992, one of the Act's transitional provisions which deals with injuries between March 23, 1990 and February 1, 1996. HELD: Appeal dismissed. Section 228 does not restrict the retroactive payment of pain benefits stemming from injury stemming from this window period and s. 228 has no application under s. 9 of the Chronic Pain Regulations restricted to an effective date.

6_2001canlii365.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving (Criminal Code ss.255(1) and 253(a)) and with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08 (Criminal Code ss.253(b) and 255(1)). Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary? HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08). Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.  1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed. The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case. In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence. It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.  5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings. Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded. 6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test. Both the subjective and objective tests were met. The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test). Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes. However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence. The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle. While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied. There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel. He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver. Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable. It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city. The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there. It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant. On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied. There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected. The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(b) and 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused had consumed alcohol in a concentration exceeding 80 milligrams in 100 millilitres of blood. The roadside screening was performed and the accused failed the breathalyzer test. The officer made a demand that the accused provide a breath sample for analysis pursuant to s254(3). The accused was not qualified to give expert testimony concerning the absorption and elimination of alcohol as well as the calculation of blood/alcohol concentration and the effect of alcohol on human brain function. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were breached and the only remedy was stay of proceedings and award costs.  1) The Court of Appeal reviewed the decision of the Chief Justice of Queen's Bench written at the first level of appeal and found that R. v. Bourget concerned the requested production of ampoules representative of those used in analyzing the breath samples of the accused. The request was made in timely fashion, not for purposes of delay and with genuine desire to have the appropriate tests conducted. The failure of the Crown to produce the standard alcohol solution as requested by the Defence constituted a violation of s. of the Charter of Rights. 2) It is the Court's practice to wait minutes to insure that there is no mouth alcohol to dissipate before administering the roadside screening. However, it does not follow that its accuracy is immune from attack. An integral component of any analysis is the solution contained in the ampoule. If the solution is deficient it will produce an inaccurate reading. The only way in which the defence can satisfy itself as to the suitability of the solution and be sure of its truth is to conduct a breath analysis. There is no such thing as a 'live issue' as the accused was denied his right to counsel."
3_1991canlii4569.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years. The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena. The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial. He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued. The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial. The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear. He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial. Dismissing the appeal, (1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences.","The appellant was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s.253.2 of the Criminal Code. He applied for leave to appeal against the sentence of 8 years imprisonment and a firearms prohibition order. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's evidence would be reasonably capable of belief and in addition, his evidence could reasonably be expected to affect the result of the trial. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The appellant had not been advised by his counsel of the provisions of Code s.598(1)(a) that he could avoid trial by jury if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear for his trial. 2)There was nothing, either by affidavit evidence or otherwise, to show that he would give relevant evidence bearing on a decisive or potentially decisive issue. The burden on the appellant was to demonstrate that R.B.'s evidence was reasonably capable, in addition to that of his evidence, could reasonably possibly affect the trial when considered together with all the other evidence."
b_1995canlii6027.txt,"The accused appealed her conviction on a charge of impaired driving. The grounds of her appeal were that the trial judge erred in determining that she was impaired, and that the trial judge otherwise misconstrued and misapplied the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Both grounds of appeal raised questions of fact. Findings of fact are not to be reversed on appeal unless it can be established that the trial judge has made some palpable and overriding error which affected her assessment of the facts. 2)The Court's task is not to retry the case or substitute its own decision. A trial judge's findings of fact can only be overturned if they are so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable. 3)The Court was unable to say that an error of that kind was made by the trial judge in this case.",The appellant appeals from the conviction of driving while over.08 contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)The trial judge made an error in law in determining the degree of impairment by alcohol or drug required before a conviction could be entered. The appellant has not shown an error by the trial judge on question of law as provided in s. 686(1)(a)(ii). 2)There was no evidence of impairment beyond a reasonable doubt on the first ground of appeal.

4_2009skca44.txt,"The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners. Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian. It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","The appellant prepared a HomePak Application on behalf of the Homeowners for the purpose of obtaining policy of insurance for their home, including coverage for their Swarovski collection. The appellant prepared the HomePak application for cancellation of the prior home insurance policy issued by SGI, which had been placed by McCallum Hill in 1992. Unknown to the appellant, the appellant had arranged for coverage outside of that which is usually provided for in the policy. SGI issued the standard 'comprehensive perils' home coverage policy with Fine Arts Rider, which contained an exclusion for accidental damage to and breakage of fragile items. The trial judge concluded that SGI was negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the homeowners, which he assessed at $7,739 (U.S.), pre-judgment interest and GST, if payable. He also concluded SGI contributed equally to the loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The appellant was found liable for failing to provide coverage beyond what is understood by, and applied for by, SGI. 2) SGI did not publish the availability of this special insurance coverage in any of the materials distributed to its agents. The defendant was not liable to the insurer where the broker failed to convey information relating to changes in the risk or amended conditions to the applicant, or for the application for renewal coverage that he completed for the applicant that he preferred to obtain. His actions constituted negligence at law. 3) There is no general duty on the insurer to issue coverage in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by the appellant. There are no special circumstances which warrant the creation of a 'new duty' to be imposed on it."
8_2010skqb467.txt,"Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year. This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates. In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration. The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme. The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed. While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case. While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages. It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations. It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation. The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","HELD: The motion was dismissed. The court found that it was not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendants to make the required retroactive adjustment payments before the end of the 2010 calendar year. The plaintiff union submitted that the essential character of the issue raised concerns the terms and conditions of employment which, in accordance with the CBA, were beyond the jurisdiction of the court. The defendants responded with motions to strike and dismiss the statement of claim pursuant to Rules 99 and 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules on the ground the essential issue raised concern the terms of employment. The plaintiffs also submitted that there might be irreparable harm for some employees, an example of which was provided to the plaintiffs in the evidence submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs. HELD: 1)The court was without jurisdiction to determine the issue pleaded based on the principles of CBA and the Weber principle. 2)It is not appropriate for the court to issue an order requiring the defendant to make retroactive adjustments before the beginning of 2010. Neither do I see any reasonable prospect of a solution to the problem by making payments on a 'best approximation' of entitlement. That is a viable solution. In the long run the results of such a solution are likely to be troublesome and chaotic. 3)As to the alternative of directing an expedited arbitration and appointing an arbitrator to conduct it, I am of the view that I am without jurisdiction. As the court was not satisfied with the pleadings and the evidence before me to meet the applicable test, the court must consider the essential issues in the context of this case. There may well be a serious issue to be arbitrated but for the purposes of the present application I find that it is not adequately framed in pleadings, evidence before the court, to meet that applicable test. 4)The plaintiffs have provided abundant evidence that in practical terms the imposition of a deadline less than two weeks from now cannot conceivably be met. Nothing is necessary in the meantime to meet this test."

The RCMP had to execute a Feeney warrant to locate the complainant in the accused basement. The Crown sought an order declaring the accused a dangerous offender. HELD: The accused was designated a dangerous offender and was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period on the conviction pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and received time served on the remaining eight charges. The evidence is conclusive that the offence for which the accused was convicted was a serious personal injury offence. The evidence was conclusive that the accused constitutes a threat to other persons because of his pattern of repetitive behaviour and persistent aggressive behaviour. The accused's First Nation would provide support for the accused but its support system is presently non-existent. The Court rejected the expert opinions recommending a long term offender order as being appropriate.","HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and two related offences stemming from breaches of no-contact conditions with L.A. and from his obstructing justice by dissuading or attempting to dissuade her from testifying against him. The accused was found not to be a dangerous offender under s. 753(1)(a)(i) and the principles articulated in R. v.

HELD: 1) Because the offence of assault is a serious personal injury offence as defined in Part XXIV of the Code, the Crown applied for an order that JR.S. be declared a 'dangerous offender'. 2) The Court reviewed the principles of sentencing and found that the accused was neither dangerous nor long-term offender. 3) The court found that it had the discretion not to designate the offender as dangerous or to impose an indeterminate sentence, even in circumstances where the less restrictive sanction under the provisions of s.753.1 may be imposed. 4) The accused had a history of breaching no contact conditions and was found to be in breach of the terms of his probation. 5) Because of the serious nature of the offences which bring about dangerous offender application, incarceration will generally be the result for both aboriginal and non-aboriginal offenders alike.  6) The Crown was not required to be satisfied on the basis of all the evidence that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the offender's risk in the community. The court was able to find that the offences that brought about the danger to the community were those committed by the accused and the offences committed by him."

He claimed for pain and suffering, loss of income and loss of earning capacity. Plaintiff was found 60% responsible for injuries and defendant 40% responsible. Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks. The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury. However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door. He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously. The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path. The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial.

The plaintiff operated a sole proprietorship known as Markham Contracting which is involved in house renovations through the winter period and landscaping in the summer. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $5,000.00 by way of general damages.  1)Given the circumstances, the realization that some of the loss can be attributed to this accident and recognizing the need to provide fair and reasonable compensation, even where proof of actual amounts may be difficult or impossible, the plaintiff did not use reasonable care for his own safety. 2)The presence of a cart or dolly out of view would also be an 'unusual danger' notwithstanding knowledge of the presence of such dollies within the premises.  3)The plaintiff's knee was swollen with infection and he had to endure considerable pain and discomfort for a substantial period following the accident.  4)The defendant's premises were described as commercial warehouse from which building supplies were sold. These circumstances were known to the plaintiff and as such he should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path as he proceeded towards the glass doors.  5) Recognizing the defendant has not used reasonable care in these circumstances to prevent injury or damage to persons in the position of the plaintiff, the court awarded the sum of $8,500.00."

The Court held that the test must be such that the public represented by the reasonably informed person would be satisfied that no use of confidential information would occur.

The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises. The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial. Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration.","HELD: The Court dismissed the application for a permanent injunction against Sobeys on the ground that the disputed questions of fact and law were beyond the scope of a summary proceeding. The Court would not automatically engage in a prolonged examination of the merits just because a breach of a negative covenant is alleged. It would be inappropriate to dismiss the application on the basis that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant have established irreparable harm. There was no evidence to support the plaintiff's claim that he will suffer permanent loss of good will, the operation may well be made unprofitable and the plaintiff may go out of business. The evidence did not establish grounds for an interim injunction at the required threshold and neither the defendant nor the plaintiff had established that they would suffer harm not compensable in damages if their claim was right and if interim relief was not given, and the balance of convenience favoured by other tenants outweighed the plaintiff."

HELD: A sentence of 5 years of imprisonment was imposed. The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent. The accused pled guilty, had no criminal record, did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victim who died from the wounds or of the other victim; she intervened to stop the beating although only after being satisfied the alleged the drug dealer had nothing to give the robbers.  The accused appeared to be doing well in the prison programs. The sentence of the co-accused who had a record of 40 previous convictions had been increased to the equivalent of more than 10 years imprisonment.","The 18 year old pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter in respect of the death of Milan Kulas. She had no criminal record but was at large on bail awaiting trial on other charges. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence on the grounds that it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of the law in terms of deterrence, denunciation and separation. HELD: The sentence of 2½ years was set aside and a sentence of 5 years imprisonment was imposed in lieu of the sentence. 1)The appellant did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victims and intervened to stop the beating of the robbers. Nor did the sentence achieve the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The appellant was doing well in all programs in prison. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was increased by this Court to the equivalent of more than ten years imprisonment. The following factors mandate a lesser sentence for Ms. Thorne: (a) she had no prior record; (b) she did not contribute in any physical beating, stabbing of Prodanovic and Kulas, albeit only after she seemed satisfied that he had nothing to give the robbers; and (c) she seems to be doing well. The Court was of the view that the sentence imposed was five years imprisonment and five years was in lieu thereof."
5_2010nspc18.txt,"The on-site supervisor was convicted of two offences under the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter of the work area and failing to ensure that an intermediate or 'mid' guardrail was installed) after a mason was killed when he fell from scaffolding on the job site. Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell. The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew. In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations. The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard. Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall.","The defendant was found guilty of breaching two provisions of the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act. He failed to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter or open side where a person was exposed to a hazard of falling contrary to s. 7(1) and 9(1)(b) of the Act and in both cases, he thereby committed an offence contrary to S. 74. HELD: The Court found that the defendant did not create or negligently leave in place a hidden hazard, which caused the defendant to fall off the work platform. The defendant was fined $8,050. The Court reviewed other cases in occupational health and safety prosecutions and found that considerable degree of restraint was required to achieve a measured response for an appropriate sentence.  1) The defendant had a duty to properly supervise the labourer and to inspect the guardrails before work was commenced in that area. He made an error in believing that the steel I-beam supporting the roof overhang could substitute as a top-rail in the circumstances of this case. 2) Looking at those cases compared to this case and bearing in mind principles of proportionality and parity, the defendant was negligent in his inspection of the work area before work commenced and for some reason that worker did not do so. The failure of the worker to do as he was directed to do and the error in judgment in believing the steel was sufficient for that purpose went to increase the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the defendant. He died as a result of those injuries."
b_2018skca65.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial. Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial. It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge's refusal to grant an adjournment was based on reasons not well-founded in law and whether the decision affected the accused's right to make full answer and defence or his right to fair trial. In the circumstances of this case, the appeal and the new trial order were granted. The Court applied the framework for review from Barrette The Queen to Ironchild, where the accused had argued that he had failed to act diligently and honestly in attempting to obtain counsel and that his spouse was in the hospital. The trial proceeded for the morning session with the Crown leading witness in the examination-in-chief. After the trial, the accused’s counsel had justifiably withdrawn as his counsel and there was no evidence to suggest that the absence of counsel was a deliberate plot to delay the trial. The appeal court reviewed what occurred in the trial to see whether there was in fact a miscarriage of justice or if the decision was based upon reasons that were not well founded in law."
5_2005nssc172.txt,"The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children. Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard. The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency. Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders. Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed. Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling","The applicants applied for leave to terminate an order for permanent care and custody respecting their three children. The applicant had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Prior to January 2005 prospective adoptive parents for R and E.C.S. gave notice of proposed adoption. Counsel for the applicants indicated that they intended to proceed with the application for leave rather than the application to terminate. HELD: The application was granted. The Court found that the applicants had not made sufficient progress to justify granting leave to apply to terminate the order. There was no evidence of parenting courses, marriage counselling, parenting courses or parenting counselling. The applicants' parenting was abysmal. Although other parenting services are available, it is unlikely that these services will benefit them sufficiently."

The defendant did not file affidavit evidence but opposed the application solely on the basis that recent amendments to the Queen's Bench Act precludes reference to minutes of settlement. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to enter judgment for $15,000 plus costs of this application. A settlement agreement reduced to writing in no way offends the confidentiality required under s.28.1. The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to them in his affidavit. Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to this situation. If a party to an action is unable to enforce a concluded settlement, the pre-trial process becomes meaningless. The legislation never intended such a result. There was no suggestion that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settlement. Nor was it suggested the minutes were unclear or ambiguous. The defendant did not allege the settlement was amended or altered or that the balance of $15,000 does not remain owing.","This is an application by the plaintiff for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 184A(1)(a) and/or s29 of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998, c.

The defendant did not allege that the settlement was amended or altered at that time. Nor did he suggest that the balance of $15,000.00 did not remain owing. Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to the situation before me.  1) Once an agreement has been finalized and executed by parties there is no further requirement for such confidentiality with respect to the concluded agreement. If the parties had not reached a settlement agreement any reference to such discussions, admissions, disclosures, concessions, negotiations or evidence arising from anything said in the course of a course of litigation would be lost. 2) There is no suggestion by the defendant that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of the settlement."
c_2003skqb46.txt,"The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA. The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949. The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19. A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application. HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck. The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.  LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","The Attorney General applies to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes, or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. HELD: 1) The claim is based on events said to have occurred over 50 years ago, the two year limitation period must be calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability.  2) Even if the time limitation period in s. 2(1)(d)(i) of the LAA applies to claims arising from the conduct of two deceased employees of the Residential School, the plaintiffs are exempt from this limitation period. 3) The 12 month limitation period under s. 3(1(d)(h) of The LAA does not apply to the claim of negligence, breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duty arising from acts committed by the Crown servants, agents, and employees. The limitation period explicitly begins to run '... from the discovery of the cause of the action'. 4) The Attorney General argues that the twelve-month limitation period is the only vehicle available for bringing an action against the Crown in right of Canada in provincial court. 5) Counsel for the Attorney General argued the twelve month limitation should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the Act. The same argument was rejected in [R.J.G.] v. Attorney General of Canada and Missionary Oblates-Grandin Province.  6) The only matter that is before the Court is the bare question of law and in any event conclude that the Crown is generally liable in tort.  7) Although the plaintiff cannot pursue a claim against the Federal Government for the intentional tort of trespass, assault and battery of its officers and servants occurring prior to the date the Act was signed into law, the fact that the plaintiff was physically assaulted while he was in a relationship of dependency with the perpetrators of the assaults is a factual matter to be dealt with at trial.  8) The twelve month limit period in the POPA is set aside by s3(3.2) for actions which fall within the scope of s.3(1). 9) The parties agree that Helen Greyeyes was one of the employees alleged to have abused the plaintiff.  10) The evidence shows that the evidence of the alleged perpetrators is insufficient to determine whether the plaintiff can satisfy the requirements of discoveryability."
c_1996canlii6986.txt,"A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division. The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'. The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500. At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach. The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law. None were found in either case. The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.  2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format. The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case. 3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified. Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct. The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee. They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act. If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case. In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220. The concluding paragraph was amended to read: Subject to what has been stated in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the respondent will be entitled to recover its costs of, and incidental to this appeal, from the appellant, to be taxed on Column 3.","This was an appeal pursuant to s. 51 of the League of Educational Administrators, Directors and Superintendents Act from the decisions of the Discipline Committee, the Executive Committee and the LEADS. The issues raised by this application were: 1) Did the discipline committee err in its finding of fact as set forth in s. 62(3) of the Act or in its application of the burden of proof as alleged in ground number 7 of the notice of appeal? 2) Did it err in applying the onus of proof to the conduct of the appellant when he misrepresented the school improvement process report involving the appellant and of threatening the appellant that if he did not submit his transfer request and resignation from the principalship that the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly' if the appellant did not comply with his terms of the agreement. 3) The discipline committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the School Effectiveness Process report involving said appellant. The Discipline Committee recommended that the appellant be reprimanded (to be placed on his file for a period of 5 years) and fined $2,500. 4) If the facts as found by the disciplinary committee are in fact true, do they constitute unprofessional conduct as set out in the grounds of s. 2 and s. 5 of the Notice of Appeal? 5)Did the discipline Committee err in application of burden of evidence as alleged by ground number 6 of this charge? 6) Was the penalty imposed by the executive committee excessive as an allegation of professional misconduct? 7) In order to establish the allegations by fair and reasonable testimony with the standard of proof being 'the highest possible standard applicable to a civil case' the Committee must first consider the evidence before making its decision."

Only six months rather than the whole year should have been counted. 2)Given the appellant's record these offences demanded more than the three year minimum generally imposed.","This was a Crown appeal against two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently.

c_2012nssc46.txt,"The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered. As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates. The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays. While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot. The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion. The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief. The motion was heard over approximately one-half day. Motion granted. The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs. The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process. It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike. The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to. Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response. Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism.","The defendant filed a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to the defendant's witnesses. The motion was allowed and the order granted included a direction as to the manner of discovery. The defendant argued that the issuance of the subpoenas was an abuse of process and that the plaintiff's counsel had made unwarranted attacks against its counsel. Defendant seeks an award of costs on a solicitor/client basis against the defendant. HELD: The defendant was successful on the motion. Normally the successful party is entitled to costs in the amount of $1,000. The Defendant has in its submission on costs stated that the actions of the defendant constituted an improper use of discovery subpoena. The Plaintiff should have made this motion to determine the order of discovery, without excluding the Defendant's representative as was suggested by the Plaintiff during negotiations to reach an agreement on Discovery. Further, the Plaintiff's counsel's actions were not about exclusion of witnesses, as that was not what it was seeking. The Court must show it's dissatisfaction with this approach by the Defendant’s counsel in strong terms."
4_2016skqb136.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage. They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012. The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","The parties separated in July 2010. Since then they have had ongoing disputes about the parenting of their children, child and spousal support, exclusive possession of the family home and division of family property. The respondent has engaged in parental alienation. The petitioner applied for an order abridging the time for the hearing of this application. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The Court found that the application was not an application for a restraining order under s. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children's Law Act and/or the order of Kraus J. of November 22, 20112. 2)The court found that it was at the time of an interim disposition that one should not lightly disturb de facto arrangements. 3)The interim parenting time was to be on Wednesdays from 3:20 until 7:00 pm and alternating weekends from Friday until Sunday at 7:30 pm. 4)The children were to continue to have their interim primary residence with the respondent. 5)The respondent had not brought a formal application to change the previous interim order. He had little opportunity to do so. 6)There was no evidence to support the petitioner's belief that the respondent was attempting to 'alienate' the children."

Dismissing the appeal, that the police officers were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion when they detained the appellant, and had a reasonable basis for stopping his vehicle. The appellant's contention he consumed only two small bottles (1-1/2 ounces each) of rum, plus some cough syrup and mints, did not constitute evidence to the contrary to rebut the presumption of the breathalyzer offence. On Appeal.","The accused was arrested for impaired driving, read a breathalyser demand, and gave him the usual warning. At trial, the accused was convicted of impaired driving. Included in the accused's evidence was his statement that he had had two drinks of rum at another location prior to going to the alleged after hours club. He advised the court he had taken some mints and cough drops while at the police station and before he took the two breather tests. The accused appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the Court of Appeal applied the proper principles of law to the facts of the particular case in excluding evidence.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was clear from the trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the two paramedics who had noted the car parked in an unusual place and police officer who came along later, that he rejected the theory advanced by the appellant's counsel.

The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature. The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders. The Court found the sentences must be set aside. The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment. HELD: The total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served.","The respondents all worked as street level cocaine dealers, selling crack cocaine in gram, gram and gram amounts for a criminal gang based in Edmonton known as the Crazy Dragons. During the last 60 days of their release, the police recorded on wiretaps in excess of 600 drug deals made by the respondents. This would have involved a minimum of 300 grams and a maximum of 2.1 kilograms for proceeds of between $36,000 and $180,000. The respondents worked 12 hours a day and rotated their shifts so that the phone and delivery car were being operated twenty four hours per day, seven days per week. The noted high volume of sales was made possible by practices defined by the organization and established to ensure that they worked as an efficient team to ensure delivery of cocaine on a 24 hour day basis while reducing the risk of discovery. The offences were carried on in furtherance of criminal organization. An appropriate sentence for each respondent, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of these offences, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, for a total of 30 months imprisonment, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. The sentences imposed in these cases must be set aside. HELD: The sentence of one year was demonstrably unfit, in light of the serious offences, even after considering the mitigating factors of the offenders.  1) The respondents had already served 5 months of the conditional sentence imposed by the sentencing judge, for which they should be given credit.  2) The sentence in each case was 30 months, 5 months having already been served.  3) The Court of Appeal was of the view that the range of sentencing for trafficking in cocaine is 18 months to 4 years and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party.  4) Considerations of parity alone would have warranted a sentence of years on the trafficking charge alone in the circumstances of this case.  5) The sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of the offence, particularly in light the volume of trafficking and lengthy period of time over which it had taken place, the highly dangerous nature of the substances sold, which included crack cocaine, the fact that their motivation was financial gain.  6) The court of appeal allowed the appeal from the bench, substituting a more lengthy period for the conditional sentences originally imposed, with more extensive reasons to follow."
d_1995canlii5746.txt,"When Davidson, Sr. sold his farm to his son he retained the right to continue receiving the rentals arising from four surface leases which he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells. The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases. There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title. HELD: Declaration denied. Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs. 1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.  2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him. His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego. This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years.","The plaintiff sold his farm to his son in 1968 and retained the right to continue receiving rentals arising from four surface leases he had granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells.

It was apparent in this case that there was an intention that, inter alia, caveats protecting surface leases were merged since they were recognized and allowed to continue. 4)It was apparent that the lease agreement was not in any way a defence against the owner's right to a rental interest. 5)The Court was not obliged to intervene in this matter because the plaintiff's action had been dismissed. 6)There were no errors in law."
d_1995canlii3966.txt,The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of assaulting his 8 year old stepdaughter by slapping her and striking her with a small paddle. The Crown and counsel for the accused agreed that a fine and probation would be appropriate. The trial judge sentenced him to 1 year in prison and 1 year's probation. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The force applied was minimal and the child was not injured physically. 2)The sentence imposed would result in the accused losing his employment which would harm his dependents. 3)The Court reduced his sentence to 60 days intermittent.,"The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment and one year's probation. The evidence indicated that the assault consisted of cuffing the eight year old stepdaughter rather frequently as a disciplinary measure. The trial judge must have been influenced to substantial degree by the lack of parenting skills displayed by the appellant in the way he mistreated and verbally abused the young girl in a manner which was demeaning and destructive of her self image. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a sentence of 60 days intermittent be substituted for the sentence of 1 year. The probation order was to remain unchanged except to substitute the word 'approved' for'supervised' in the first condition. The sentence of one year under these circumstances, even with the record of the appellant, is excessive. In addition, the appellant would lose his current employment upon which the family is reliant."
6_1997canlii9876.txt,"The respondent was hired as an account manager by the appellant. She did not reach her planned sales goals during her employment, and became depressed. She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor. When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job. She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed. The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress. The appellant appealed the award for mental distress. Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal, that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice. Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment. However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises.","The appellant Healthvision Corporation, which sells computer systems including hardware and software to hospitals and other health care facilities, appealed a jury award of $60,000 damages for mental distress brought by the respondent. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)While aggravated damages may be awarded in actions for breach of contract in appropriate cases, this is not case where they should be given. 2)The court found that mental suffering would not have been in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the employment contract was entered into as flowing from the appellant's unjust dismissal. 3)The Court found that the conduct of Healthvision Corp. was high handed and callous. It was not appropriate to award damages based upon the provisions of the employment agreement. 4)The principles of contract law were well established and their broad application would appear preferable to decision-making based on priori and inflexible categories of damages."
e_1999skqb268.txt,"The defendant manufactured solarium in Saskatoon which it sold to the plaintiffs in Minnesota. The plaintiffs alleged the solarium was defective, sued and obtained judgment in the Minnesota Court which it now sought to enforce in Saskatchewan. The defendant argued the Minnesota court did not have jurisdiction because at the time the action was commenced he was not 'ordinarily resident' in the state of Minnesota. The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act. 2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there. The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address. It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state. The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'.","The plaintiffs sought to enforce payment by the defendant of judgment for $23,396.03 in US currency awarded them by Carver County District Court, First Judicial District, in the State of Minnesota. The defendant advertised its business in the state of Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that it was a business address. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs to be taxed.  1) The court in Minnesota did not have jurisdiction over the defendant because at the time the action was commenced the defendant was not 'ordinarily resident' in Minnesota and did not appear and surrender to its jurisdiction. 2) Because of the activities of the defendant in Minnesota the logical conclusion, so it seems to me, is that it is a Business address."
4_2000canlii3136.txt,"In a trial of liability only, jury found defendants to be entirely responsible for causing motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff. Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages. Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied. Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount. The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced. There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment. Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition. In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered. Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application. The evidence in support of the spouse's application was far too incomplete and had yet to be tested by defendants in discovery. Court could not form opinion on what damages spouse was likely to recover.","The plaintiff was seriously injured in a motor vehicle head-on collision. He brought an action for the recovery of damages from his employer, Schneider National Carriers. The issues of liability and damages were severed following a civil jury trial. The issue of liability only was tried in April 2000 as result of which it was found that the accident was caused by the negligence of the defendants. With a judicial assessment of damages several months away, the plaintiffs have now brought an application under Civil Procedure Rule 33.01(A)(1) seeking an interim payment of damages. HELD: The court found that $250,000 represents a just amount of interim payment that ought to be made to the plaintiff. Even though this medical evidence has not yet been tested by the defendants and the evidence is not complete enough at this stage for the court to be able to form an opinion as to the likelihood of recovery of either of these heads of damages, it is not appropriate to order an interim payments be made for her benefit.  1) The evidence to support the validity of this claim is far from complete at this time and that which is before the defendants in further pre-hearing procedures is yet to be tested. However, the assumptions underlying these claims have not yet even form part of the pleadings. 2) The assumptions underlying the damages claim are not complete. At this stage the court is unable to form a opinion of what damages are likely to be recovered by the plaintiff at a final assessment of the damages and is not able to formulate an opinion of the likelihood that she will recover some measure of compensation for loss of future earnings.  3) There is no evidence of a pre-existing medical condition which would warrant immediate payment of this amount.  4) The court is not aware that the defendants have yet availed themselves of the opportunity to discover any of Mr. Fowler's medical doctors or to conduct an independent medical examination or to retain other experts as they see fit. 5) Even though the Medical Report also quantifies the loss of valuable services incurred to date (which are nearing the $300,000 mark), there is a much higher degree of certainty that the plaintiff will recover substantial amount of special damages which are acknowledged to be nearing the value of the plaintiff's current earnings. 6) The defendants did not yet have an opportunity to examine any of the plaintiffs' physicians on discovery nor to obtain independent medical examinations or other expert reports."
2003skqb248.txt,"An appeal from conviction and sentence for theft of an electricity generator valued at under $5,000 contrary to Criminal Code s.334(b). On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction. The appellant pled not guilty. Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction. Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began. Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.  1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2). 2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods. The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft. Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly. There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.  3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge. However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines. If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed. There was nothing in the decision that convinces the Court that the learned judge in reviewing the conviction misconstrued or misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offence alleged and found him guilty as charged.  1)There was nothing to suggest the learned trial judge in weighing the evidence committed any palpable and manifest or overriding error.  2)The appellant was an employee of SaskPower and had access to the storage shed. He was one of six owners of the fishing camp. Two of the other owners were also SaskPower employees. 3)All SaskPower storage sheds at the time could be accessed by single key, so all SaskPower operating employees would have been able to enter the shed at Colonsay. The appellant however was somewhat more closely connected to the owner of the camp. There were various valuable and portable items such as chainsaws in the shed but the only thing missing other than the generator was an electrical cord especially made to use with the generator.  4)The Court reviewed the case of R. v. Sheppard, 2002 SCC 26 (CanLII), [2002] S.C.R. 869, decision of the Supreme Court delivered by Binnie J. Re Parkin and the Queen. The procedural irregularity is not subject to s. 822(7) pertaining to defect."

They were not habitually resident in Saskatchewan and had been here only 3 months. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. The uncontradicted evidence that the mother never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home was accepted.

The father was directed to forthwith file an undertaking to not disturb the status quo until court authorization has been obtained.","The petitioner sought interim custody, or primary residence of the children, pursuant to s. 6 of The Children's Law Act. The respondent sought a declaration declining jurisdiction or an order of joint custody pursuant to the Act.

The children have a real and substantial connection with British Columbia, and the substantial evidence concerning their best interests is available in that jurisdiction.  2)The parties were married in 1994. They are both university graduates and teachers. The petitioner was employed as substitute teacher at Richmond until the time of the birth of their son when she became full-time homemaker. The mother continues to be employed as full time homemaker in Richmond. The parties have two children: their son will be six years of age in June and their daughter will four years in May. The father delayed in bringing an application for custody in British Columbia because of his mistaken belief that the petitioner was considering reconciliation, although he learned when he received her affidavit in support of her custody application that she never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home. The evidence, which is uncontradicted, leads to the conclusion that the father did not impliedly consent, nor acquiesce, to the children living with their mother in Regina."

In an action initiated in the Supreme Court, Twin Mountain Construction (the respondent) has claimed that Norma and Murray Tweedie 'negligently or fraudulently' misrepresented the boundaries of a parcel of property that they sold to the respondent. Alternatively, the respondent claimed breach of contract. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The absence of the particulars sought was not a serious issue.  2)Rule 14.24 provides that particulars of damages need only be pleaded where the demand is liquidated. An expectation claim which depends upon variable factors (here, factors such as the state of the economy, the price of sand, the cost of excavation) need not be particularized in the pleadings. 3)Rule 18, 19 and 20 can be used to discover the underlying details of the damages claim. It is difficult to conceive of what additional information they need at this stage. The respondent has specified the type of damages that it seeks. 4)The necessity for particulars must be evaluated taking into account the nature of the action and the timing of the demand in the context of the Civil Procedure Rules as whole.

d_2000nsca117.txt,"Liability was admitted for a very mild rear end collision. The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health. It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem. The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000. The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment. Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs. Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages.","The respondent admitted liability for driving his truck into the back of the appellant's motor vehicle. The trial judge described the rear end of the vehicle as a very mild rear end collision. The appellant cross appeals claiming that the trial judge's award of $25,000, as general damages, is excessive and should be reduced. The appeal and cross appeal both dismissed without costs as per oral reasons. HELD: Appeal and cross appeals both dismissed. 1) There was ample medical evidence to support that the accident did not contribute, in a material way, to the appellant’s present medical problems. No such reasons were advanced by the appellant in this case.  2) While recognizing the particular pain and anxiety which the respondent was found to have caused to him and at the same time, recognizing that a pre-existing condition was the major aggravation of his present problems and his present health problems, the trial Judge assessed the appellant`s general damages at $25.000. In our opinion, and in the circumstances of this case, that award cannot be said to be so far outside the range of damages for like cases as to be considered a wholly erroneous estimate of damages. 3) The appeal was both dismissed and the cross appeal was also dismissed. 4) The appellant is essentially asking this court to set aside the credibility findings against him, to take a different view of the medical evidence than did the judge and, ultimately, to attribute a larger percentage of appellant's present health issues to the accident in question, with correspondingly higher assessment of damages against the respondent."
1999skqb142.txt,"FIAT. The former registered representative of TFPG was terminated for selling unapproved investments in breach of a Shareholder Advisor Agreement which permitted the sale of TFPG's financial products and services only. TFPG sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the respondent to return all materials and files respecting TFPG's clients, to cease any contact with its clients, and to make no attempt to solicit any current or prospective client. HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG. The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services. 1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.  2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration. It was not unconscionable nor against public policy. The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement. The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor. The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm.","FIAT.

b_2011nssc75.txt,"After a piece of family property was divided into two parcels, one of the brothers continued to use a driveway and maintain a garden on the other parcel. When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times. When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription. He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission. Judgment for the defendants; there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway. Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission.","This is a dispute about the use of property. The plaintiff wants to continue to garden on the Keel property and use the Borden driveway. By this action he claims he has the right to do both. HELD: 1) The plaintiff has not shown that the reservation contained in the 1942 Eldard deed to Borden's property is or incorporates the Bordens driveway. There is no expressed reservation shown by the plaintiff herein.  2) The Defendants have shut off the 'Borden driveway' to the plaintiff and do not consent to his continued use of the garden on their property.  3) There is considerable and convincing evidence that Eldred and Roy Longard in combination used 'the Borden Road' in a continuous, uninterrupted, open, and peaceful manner for many years prior to it being blocked off by the Defendants. This permission extended by Borden and then to Roy precludes the creation of any right to cross the Bordene driveway created by a prescription or lost modern grant. 4) The nature of the enjoyment necessary to establish a right is not in dispute."

The accused was charged as the owner of the vehicle, not necessarily the driver. The offence was the result of a speed monitoring camera and the Act allows the Crown to complete their case without calling any witnesses. The accused testified that he did not speed past any highway workers or equipment. He said that he was following a pilot vehicle when he passed the workers and equipment and only sped up after the pilot vehicle turned around when there were no more workers or equipment. The picture of the accused’s vehicle from the speed monitoring camera did not show any highway workers or equipment. HELD: The person who tested and deployed the speed monitoring camera provided affidavit evidence that the picture was taken within a marked construction area but it did not say that the accused was speeding as he was passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment. Section 203(1) specifies that there is only an offence for travelling at a speed greater than 60 km/h when passing highway workers or operating equipment. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused was charged with the offence of driving faster than 60 km per hour when passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone. The offence under s. 203(1) of The Traffice Safety Act is a strict liability offence and its documentary evidence proves every element of the offence. The only aspect of the Crown's case that the accused disputes is that he passed highway workers in a marked construction area, or when passed highway equipment actually on the highway and with its warning lights operating. The accused was not charged as the driver of the vehicle but as its registered owner. Section 273 of The Traffic Safety Act makes the registered owner liable for the driver's misconduct when the vehicle is driven by anyone who has the owner's actual or implied consent to do so. HELD: The accused is not guilty.  1) The offence is driving at 60 km/hr.  2) The evidence consisted of the following documents: 1) a speed monitoring camera showing the date and time the photograph was taken, the speedometer and the vehicle's speed immediately after it passed the workers or equipment, or 3) affidavits of service confirming service of the Summary Offence Notice, the photograph, Mr. Christensen's affidavit and the SGI Motor Vehicle Division certified search.  4) The accused did not ask for an order requiring the judge to attend for the purpose of cross-examination."

This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will.",This was an application for the interpretation of the Last Will and Testament of the Testator and specifically to determine the entitlement of the Estate of Jane Mitchell under the Will pursuant to s. 31 of the Wills Act. HELD: The testator intended to make a separate bequest to each individual child rather than make the gift personae designatae rather than a class gift. The Court was unable to discern a 'contrary intention' in the testator's Will.
2_1999canlii12398.txt,"The parties were involved in an accident. The defendant stopped at a stop sign 39 feet from the intersection and rolled forward while yielding. The plaintiff locked his brakes and skidded into the defendant, attempting to avoid an accident. Damage to both vehicles exceeded the insurance deductibles and both parties claim damages against each other for the amount of the deductibles. HELD: The plaintiff will have judgment against the defendant in the amount of $50. The defendant will have judgment against the plaintiff in the amount of $450 plus costs. Fault for this accident was attributed 10% to the defendant and 90% to the plaintiff. The defendant had indeed yielded properly but could have been more prudent in insuring that other motorist were aware that she yielded. The plaintiff should have taken more appropriate measures to avoid the accident","The plaintiff, who was travelling west on Highway 306 near Grey, Saskatchewan, saw car driven by Margaret Henry approach from his right, stop at the stop sign, and then proceed forward toward the highway. He applied his brakes with such force that his truck entered skid, left the highway, and struck the side of the car. The damages to both the truck and the car exceeded the $500 insurance deductible. The plaintiff brought an action against the car's owner, Vernon Henry, and the Henrys for his $500 deductible and counterclaim for the same. The defendant counterclaimed for $500."
b_2007skqb1.txt,"This is an appeal pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act, 1997. The appellant asserts a palpable and overriding error by the learned trial judge in accepting, and finding as fact, part of the testimony of a witness but not accepting the further testimony of the witness that an amount was also owing to the appellant by the respondent. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The trial judge was not required to accept the entirety of the witness's testimony, despite having accepted most of it, particularly in light of the contradictory evidence of the respondent denying the sum claimed by the appellant. The denial by the respondent of the appellant's claim, accepted by the trial judge, was fatal to the appellant's onus of proving a mutual understanding and absolute acknowledgement of the alleged debt between the parties.","This is an appeal pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act from judgment given January 19, 2006. The appeal is dismissed. There is no order as to costs. The trial judge accepted most of the testimony of the witness, including her evidence as it related to an implied admission by the respondent of some existing indebtedness owing to the appellant. Nor did he expressly reject her testimony as to the amount, $1,900. The transcript clearly shows that the respondent unequivocally denied any loan made to him by the appellant in 2005. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The standard of appellate review is that of palpable and overriding error and its functional equivalents, including 'clearly wrong, 'unreasonable' and 'not reasonably supported by the evidence' (the principle of law and case authorities were not before the trial judge nor argued on this appeal)."
d_1999canlii12581.txt,"In issue was whether the Bank breached its lending contract, its fiduciary duty or duty of confidentiality; and if so, what damages, if any, should be awarded. The defendant's bank loans fell into default after SGI disability benefits were terminated. The Bank reported the particulars of the loan defaults to a credit reporting agency (Equifax). The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans. The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement. The bank commenced this action for payment. The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract. HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims. The bank's claim was admitted at trial. 1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement. The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate. Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case. 3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business.","The plaintiff banked with the defendant, Royal Bank of Canada, and at the time of the accident the Compain's were indebted to the Royal Bank under Royal Bank Credit Line and Visa credit card account (the ""Bank Loans""). The Royal Bank agreed to defer commencement of any action with respect to the defaulted Bank Loans until such time as Mr. Compain received an accident injury settlement from SGI. Royal Bank requested a written assignment of the settlement proceeds, however, the respondent declined to give an assignment. The plaintiff's counter-claim against the bank for general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages was dismissed. There was no evidence that the characterization of the loans as collection accounts was out of the normal course of business."
2_2011skpc5.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over. 08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop. The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time. The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar. The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up. The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle. The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count. The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date. The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability. The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward. The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door. The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.08. The defence admitted all of the essential elements of each charge; the only issue was whether or not the accused was the person operating the vehicle. The accused was found guilty on count 1, the charge of impaired operation of a motor vehicle. HELD: The defence evidence lacked reliability. 1)The defence evidence lacks reliability. 2)At the time the individuals got into the truck, Ms. Neigel was behind the wheel; the police officers were aware that there were five or six people in the vehicle at the time of the incident. The police officer was adamant and unshaken in his evidence that the keys were in the ignition when the police arrived at the vehicle and had been in the truck since the time they left the bar. The evidence of the complainant was severely hampered by her alcohol intake on December 4 and 5. The court found the accused guilty of impaired driving on both counts. 3)Although there were a number of inconsistencies in the evidence, the defence evidence was absolutely satisfied of the facts. The officer was polite and cooperative both in examination-in-chief and cross-examination, and the ability to observe what occurred on December 5, and accurately recall it almost one year later at trial, was severely hindered by the alcohol intake."
b_2006skqb218.txt,"The respondent applies to vary the consent joint custody order granted in October 2004. His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson. The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson. HELD: 1) The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent. This also requires a change in access arrangements. These are changes in circumstances that are material.  2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson. The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey. After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child. Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis. Even telephone access has been sporadic. Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3) The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation. The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support. 4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson. It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to. The petitioner has always been Tyson's primary caregiver. The petitioner is the psychological parent.","HELD: The application was granted. The sole issue on this variation application is determining the primary residence of Tyson. That entails deciding what is in his best interests. The law relating to the mobility rights of divorced parents was clearly defined in Gordon v. Goertz. Before a custodial/primary parent is permitted to relocate a child where there is an existing custody order or agreement, there must be material change in circumstances affecting the child since the making of that order. The move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed prior to the relocation. The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support. They had not bothered to rectify the error."

The appellant had done everything required of it pursuant to the Act. The provisions of s. 39 did not require the appellant to follow up with the local registrar’s office to see if the transcript had been filed.

The transcript was not filed within the six month period set forth in ss.39(5). The appellant argued it did nothing wrong here and it would be an affront to the administration of justice to simply determine the appeal to be dismissed.

Steps were not taken to ensure that no disclosure of information would occur for a month after the firm was put on notice. At issue was whether the screening measures taken ensured that no disclosure would occur and satisfied the evidentiary burden imposed on the law firm. HELD: The solicitor and the law firm were disqualified from acting for the petitioner in the action. Because two years had lapsed further examinations were appropriate and an order issued for the petitioner to attend a further examination. If the updated information is not necessary for trial the petitioner may request costs at that time. The application for an order with respect to without prejudice offers of settlement was dismissed as matters of evidence were to be determined by the trial judge.  1)Since the decision in Martin v. Gray the Law Society amended the code of conduct to provide for rules where a member transfers from one law firm to another. 2)The difficulty in this case was that no measures were taken prior to or at the time the solicitor joined the firm to ensure confidentiality. The time period before taking appropriate steps was completely inadequate.  3)The second question, whether there was a risk that the confidential information will be used to the prejudice of the client, Martin v.

The difficulty in the instant case is that no measures were taking prior to the respondent joining the firm as there is a risk of a breach of confidentiality and to have the motion and documents related to this motion sealed are dismissed.

In an action for professional negligence against a solicitor for failing to obtain specific security requested in written instructions, the plaintiff renegotiated the deal and no longer insisted upon receiving the specific security. That the plaintiff was estopped from exercising any rights against the solicitor under the original instructions.","This was an action by Farm Credit Corporation (FCC) against the defendant, a barrister and solicitor practising in Middleton, Nova Scotia. It is a claim in professional negligence for the losses sustained by the defendant for the alleged negligence of the defendant. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed. 1)The defendant had been engaged by the Langilles over the years as their solicitor and he continued to act for them on their behalf in this transaction. 2)The defendants had made a loan to be secured by a mortgage on real estate known as the 'Phinney farm'. The defendant had renegotiated the deal with the Langilles and gave up the original security. There was a serious question that some of the surrendered security was of substantially greater value than that taken up. The actions were taken without any regard to the impact on the legal rights of the plaintiff. It would be patently unfair for the defendant in this action to lull the plaintiff into a sense of security by renegotiating the deal, several years later, hold Gillis responsible under the original deal. 3)There were other circumstances which militated against the defendants. Between the time the mortgage deal was made in 1979 and the foreclosure action several things occurred. FCC renegotiated new security for the mortgage, gave up an original security, and then several years after the default, held the defendant responsible for the breach of the loan package. 4)The plaintiffs were then, and are now, estopped from exercising any of their rights against Gillis or R.

7_2014skqb116.txt,"Tax Law – Contract for Services – Payment of PST The plaintiff has the onus of proving it is not liable for the payment of PST on a balance of probabilities. Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit. The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties. There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay. The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced. In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials. In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided. The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky. On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act. Husky was the user or consumer of the cement. The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well. Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts. Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property. Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law. Husky has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that it is entitled to a refund of the PST it paid on well cementing contracts between itself and third parties. The claim is dismissed.","HELD: The plaintiff sought a refund of the Saskatchewan Provincial Sales Tax it had paid on well cementing contracts it had with third parties. The Government of Saskatchewan, pursuant to s.50(2) of The Revenue and Financial Services Act, imposed PST on the contracts. The third parties brought an application to be allowed to defend the liability of the Government at trial. An order was made and the third parties were allowed to do so. The plaintiff was awarded $419,964.69 plus interest as claimed in the third party's statement of defence. The court found that the amount to be refunded to the plaintiff was not subject to the limitation period set forth in s.56 of The Education and Health Tax Act. HELD: Even if the Government was entitled to refund of PST from the plaintiff, the payment of the PST from third parties would not be reduced by virtue of the limitation time. 1)The plaintiff was the final user and consumer of the materials provided pursuant to the contracts between the plaintiff and third party contractors. 2)The third party was not liable to pay the PST on any of the contracts it entered into with the plaintiff. 3)The Government was not responsible to refund the PST. 4)The court held that even if the government was liable to refund PST, the parties who entered into the contracts did so in undetermined amounts on materials they consumed in the performance of their contracts with Husky. The fact that the plaintiff had not remitted some or all of the PST on the materials and that the parties properly levied and collected tax on the amount of PST allegedly owing was without merit. 5)The Court found that there was no mistake of law in payment of PST by the plaintiff to the Saskatchewan Government. 6)The claim against the plaintiff for refunding the PST was barred by s.55(4) of the Revenue and Finance Act and the Limitation of Actions Act. 7)The amount of the refund was reduced by the limitation of time between the claim and the trial date. 8)The defendant was not entitled to the refund of its PST for the period 1996 to 2001."

The two terms of closed custody, having been ordered to be served concurrently with the remainder of the previous term, did not constitute a fit sentence having regard for the seriousness of the offenses, the need for deterrence and the need to uphold public confidence in the administration of justice."

HELD: 1)Section 258(7) has been judicially amended to mean 'true copy' which presumably, though not logically, means something more than 'copy'. It has grown to the point that an affidavit may be disregarded if the police do not provide supplemental evidence when challenged as to the manner in which they assured the accuracy of the copy. 2)The trial judge further advanced the law to a point where, even when not challenged, there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit. This is an error of law. A challenge under s258(7) should be based upon a discovered difference as between the copy and the original. Otherwise the refusal to admit the certificate becomes merely a prize in a procedural game which can only bring the justice system into disrepute. 3)A new trial was ordered to determine whether the stop was justified.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code.

P. Weber was tendered in evidence establishing that a true copy of the certificate had been served upon the accused. HELD: The appellant was entitled to a new trial. 1)It would not be unreasonable to require that if there was a challenge under this subsection of the affidavit or of the copy supplied, it should be based upon a discovereddifference as between the copy and the original. Otherwise the refusal to admit the certificate becomes merely the prize in procedural game which can only bring the justice system into disrepute. The validity of the stop is one of fact and the stop was not a fact. 2)The appellant was asked notwithstanding the above finding of error of law to consider whether, in the circumstances the police officer was justified in stopping the respondent's vehicle.

B-3, as a result of the sheriff's return of nulla bona to the respondent's writ of execution against the debtor.

[4] As for the first, the debtor did not satisfy Justice Koch that he was able to pay his debts or that there existed other sufficient cause to dismiss the petition. Based on the evidence adduced by the debtor, we are of the view there is no basis to conclude that Mr. Justice Koch should have been satisfied of these matters. [5] As for second, concerning ss. 43(11), we note that the subsection contains discretionary power to stay proceedings. That, of course, serves to narrow the basis for intervention on appeal.

3_1999canlii12358.txt,"Two female employees filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination contrary to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. The unionized employer applied for judicial review in the nature of prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s.25 of the Trade Union with the result that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship and granted an order prohibiting the Board of Inquiry from hearing and determining the matter. Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount. HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment. 2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect. 3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account. It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.  4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff. No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25] This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator. The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction. The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement. To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.","HELD: The order of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter remitted to the Board of Inquiry established under the Act in accordance with the provisions of the Act. 1)Human rights are more than just statutory rights. They are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. While it is true that the employees' employment rights were inferentially affected because the alleged act of discrimination was addressed by the collective agreement, the mere fact that an alleged violation of the Code occurred in place of employment rather than in some other setting is not determinative. 2)The Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship of the employees. The Act provides that all disputes between the parties to collective agreement concerning employment rights covered in the agreement must be resolved by binding arbitration. 3)While human rights legislation is not constitutional in nature, it is of such a special nature that it cannot be contracted out of, altered, amended or repealed nor may exceptions be created to its provisions except by clear legislative intent and pronouncement. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights it seeks to protect. 4)The fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on a basis of the grounds set out in the Code does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach. 5)A board of inquiry appointed pursuant to s. 25 of the Human Rights Code would have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve the matter. 6)The Board of inquiry was appointed by the Minister of Justice pursuant to Rules 664 and 663 of the Queen’s Bench Rules of Court with the result that the appellant was entitled to costs on double column in this Court and on the appropriate tariff in the court below."
e_2005skqb51.txt,"The plaintiff seeks damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp. He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning. The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount. It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements. 1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge. The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty. The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. 4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention. The plaintiff experienced headaches for several weeks. He also had stiff neck and sleep disturbance. There were no long term effects. Corrigendum received January 25, 2005 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff sought damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages, arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction in the early morning of May 16, 2001.

The plaintiff was convicted of remaining in licensed premises after being required to leave contrary to s. 122(2)(a) of The Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act, 1997.

She also claimed that periodic maintenance was not appropriate because of the difficulty of enforcement when she is living abroad and referenced two occasions when the husband was paying periodic support that she had to seek the assistance of Maintenance Enforcement. The husband opposed paying any more spousal support but expressed a preference for lump sum support if he was required to pay more, as it would allow him to move on with his life with his new family. Husband ordered to pay a lump sum award of $10,000 to wife; when the parties moved to Nova Scotia, the husband was able to improve his financial situation, while the wife's position deteriorated.","The parties were married in 1996 having previously been married in Sweden and then divorced in 1993. There are no children of their relationship and the only contested issue on this hearing is the respondent's claim for lump sum spousal support. HELD: The respondent was to pay the respondent $10,000.00.  1) The Court was to properly address the competing factors of compensation, need and self-sufficiency within the framework established by Section 15 of the Act. 2) The respondent's ability to pay must be measured in accordance with his or her actual income at the trial and not by some historical standard. 3) There is a great diversity of marriages and the need to deal with support entitlement and quantum on a case-by-case basis. The Court found that the respondent was able to improve her financial position, while the respondent had effectively seen her position deteriorate."

Issues included (i)whether there had been a valid renewal of the head lease; (ii)whether there had been valid renewals of sub-leases; (iii)assuming valid renewals, did s4 of the Statute of Frauds bar enforcement against Bennett; (iv)whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear an application for relief under s11 brought solely by notice of motion; (v)are the applicants entitled to such relief; (vi)whether Bennett was bound by the sub-leases by virtue of taking the assignment from VIP. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application. Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits. 2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion. There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises. The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry. Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle. grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion. They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine. In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically. The applciants could obtain other office space including that offered by Bennett.

5_2009nspc10.txt,"The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation. Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana. When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse. He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him. After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment. The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs. Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon. The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search. He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied. The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached. While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary. Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning. After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case. Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable. The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana. The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge. Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful. The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable. In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. The accused was arrested for possession of cannabis. The defence sought an order excluding the admission of the accused's statement to the police and exclusion of the results of the search of his person. HELD: The Court held that the accused had reasonable and probable grounds to be arrested. The Court also contested the voluntariness of a statement given by the accused to the RCMP. Although there was no police caution, the Court found that his statement had been proven to be free and voluntary."
9_1994canlii4283.txt,"The respondent had undertaken the residential development of certain lands bordering the appellant's property and constructed roadways which it proposed to convey to the Department of Transportation, who agreed to accept with the consent of owners of property where water would drain from the road. When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement. The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer. The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions. In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act. Allowing the appeal, that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost. However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch. Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems.","The applicant submitted that the applicant was entitled to build a ditch and drain on the Haverstock Estate subject to certain requirements. The applicant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the scope of appeal in this matter was limited to the applicant's application and the parties' respective rights to proceed with the project. Application allowed; the applicant had failed to provide the necessary technical details of the ditch or drain. The respondent was entitled, however, to pay the engineer's fees."
b_2001skca85.txt,"The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease. In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959. The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993. After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner. The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V. The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench. 1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule. The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive. The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society. The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times. Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae. Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule. Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.  2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease. The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed. The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general. The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property. A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough. The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision. The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease. As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971. The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future. The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.","The trial judge held that the lease was void because it breached the rule against perpetuities. He allowed the counterclaim by the appellant Tarragon against the respondent Maxx Petroleum Ltd. for breach of confidence with consequent directions for an accounting and assessment of damages. The principal question on this appeal is whether the appellants' oil and gas 'top lease' with the late Harry Herbert Taylor should be rendered void. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The principle question is whether this 1950 Freeholders agreement is void under the common law rule. It is only after the time of vesting has been ascertained that a determination can be made about whether that time is too remote and therefore in contravention of the rule. The policy behind the rule is not offended. 2) The Court reviewed the history of the Freeholders lease and found that it was in the public domain and could be the subject of a breach of a perpetuity rule. There were hundreds of such leases in this province. The trial judge found that the phrase 'upon' and 'in the event', connote time and condition and not property or an interest in property. 3) There was no law of remoteness in the original lease. To ascribe to those words definition equivalent to way of describing reversionary interest is to distort the words beyond recognition. 4) In some jurisdictions the concept of 'top leases' is not unique or unusual in the Oil and Gas industry. The law of perpetuity plays no role in that process. It would not be contrary to the public interest to remove such leases from the ambit of the Rule against perpetuity. 5) In this case the Court found for the appellant that the 'top leasing' programme of Freeholders and Imperial Oil Ltd. did not infringe on the 'rules of construction'. Rather, it was a matter for the Court to determine whether the lease breached the rules of construction. 6) The court found that there was no evidence that the term 'offence' in the lease could be used to refer to the term of the lease. 7) In the context of the present situation, it is clear and unambiguous that the test for whether there has been a breach is not seriously disputed by the parties."

HELD: A trial of the issue was directed, as it could not be decided on the material filed whether he was intentionally unemployed or underemployed. The father's circumstances had changed since the consent order. The fact he no longer resided with a girlfriend and was making payments on a truck did not justify any reduction.

The real issue is whether there is a possible connection between the respondent's circumstances and the consent order as he purchased a one-half ton truck on which he has been making payments of $624 per month.

c_2012nsca78.txt,", motion denied. While the province has an arguable appeal, it does not concern a summary judgment motion that would result in the claims being dismissed outright. If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims. The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding. There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved. The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file. To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost.","The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for breach of fiduciary duty, coke ovens and steel plant. The defendants sought certification of the class proceeding under s. 7(1), naming of two classes of persons who owned property within stated radius (Property Owner Class) and (2) persons who resided within that radius for minimum period after January 5, 1968 (Residential Class). The defendants had not filed notice of defence until 45 days after the certification order was issued, and the court dismissed the motion seeking earlier filing. The motion was dismissed with costs of $1,000 in the cause of the appeal. HELD: This appeal does not involve a summary judgment motion that would dismiss the claims outright, in any form, against the defendant. Rather, the appeal seeks to strike the Certification Order for common issues trial in class proceeding. If the certification is struck, the defendant will still face individual claims, first filed in 2004, involving similar issues. The expense of defending individual claims whether litigated serially or jointly, might exceed the expense defending one common issue trial. One purpose of class proceeding is to try common issues once, instead of repeatedly, which delivers an expense efficiency to both sides. In this case, that efficiency may be sacrificed. The Court accepted that the Province's grounds of appeal were arguable on their face. There was no evidence on the point that establishing how defending individual actions would cost the defendant less than defending a common issues court trial."

The respondent contended that it should be on a full-time basis, and applied to the Supreme Court in chambers for an order quashing the appellant's decision. The chambers judge found that the appellant had ignored the clear words of s.37 of the Workers' Compensation Act in reaching its decision, and thus had exceeded its jurisdiction; the decision was quashed and the matter remitted back to the Board. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the order to quash, that s.37 of the Act was not a section limiting the Board's jurisdiction and that, considering s.37 and s.53 of the Act, the decision of the Board was not patently erroneous.","This was an appeal from a decision in Chambers allowing an application for certiorari to quash a decision of the Workers' Compensation Board and remitting the matter to the Board to determine the rate of compensation payable to the respondent.

b_1999canlii12407.txt,"The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations. It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability. The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances. The essential facts were not in dispute. HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.  1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met. This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site. Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available. Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced. The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching. No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision. The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups. 2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible. There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor. The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship. The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","The defendant was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 being Chapter 0-1.1 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan and Regulations made pursuant to the Act. The defendant had obtained a contract from the Hamlet of St. George's Hill to install sewer and water lines on four lots. He arranged to do this by using an individual he knew as a 'employer' to do the backhoe work on the excavation. As a matter of fact no inexperienced person ought to be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specificguidance and supervision. HELD: The defendant was guilty as charged on all offences. 1)The defendant had no obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers at the excavation site. He chose not to supervise the work site because he was extremely busy with other business matters which had taken him to Laloche and then to Saskatoon when the trenching was being done at StGeorge's Hill. 2)The evidence was clear that the relationship between the defendant and the workers was one of master and servant or employer and employee. The fact that the defendant arranged for his nephew to work with him does not make the defendant an employer since the relationship was akin to that of a'self-employed person' acting as a sub-contractor which have specifically adjudged that he was not in the circumstances of this case.  3)The court found that once one finds that there was a legal duty on the defendant as an employer under the Act, then his obligations under the law are to take active steps to ensure that all work at the place of employment was sufficiently and competently supervised, and did not fail to provide and maintain for work site readily accessible first aid station containing required supplies and equipment, contrary to S. 57(b). 4)The principles of the case were not in dispute and they were fairly straight-forward. The evidence was not inconsistent with the defendant's failure to take any reasonable precautions to prevent death or injury to the two workers."
c_2008nssm39.txt,"The applicant law firm applied for a taxation of accounts in a complicated family law matter. The client contended that there was obvious overbilling and that the solicitor was negligent in failing to specify in an interim Order the actual time at which she had to leave the matrimonial home. Accounts as presented are certified; there was no indication whatsoever of overbilling, whether with respect to legal fees or disbursements, and there was no negligence on the part of the solicitor as she had acted reasonably in relying on the representations of the husband's lawyer as to when the Order would be enforced. It is not always necessary to examine every single entry in detail on a line-by-line basis; an overall view of the entries contained in an account can be taken when assessing reasonableness. The temporal limitation of cross-examination is within the Small Claims Court's scope of discretion in special circumstances.","The Applicant sought a taxation of the accounts issued to the Respondent. The Respondent argued that the respondent was negligent in the execution of an order that granted interim exclusive possession of the matrimonial home to the respondent's estranged spouse. HELD: 1) The respondent firmly believed that this was an obvious overbilling. The respondent was unrepentant and did not keep her informed of all actions taken on her behalf and acted without instructions. 2) There was a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the respondent, who was clearly articulate and capable of representing herself, but, as required, went on to assess the reasonableness of Mr. Miller's legal accounts and some reductions were made. 3) There is very little in the Small Claims Court Act, supra, which specifically sets out the procedure to be followed in the Court. There is a strong presumption in favour of judicial impartiality and the presumption is that such an oath as that made by an Adjudicator at the outset of his or her appointment will be respected by that adjudicator. However, in some judicial districts in Nova Scotia, there may only be a roster of one or two Adjudicators who hear a small Claims Court case. In this case, Ms. Stephen firmly believes that this is an obvious underbilling and the respondent is negligent in this regard. 4) In both civil law and criminal law contexts, courts have repeatedly found that decision-makers' participation in earlier proceedings involving the same party or parties who are again before the decision-maker in fresh, new proceedings does not, and should not, invariably lead to disqualification. Such prior participation as basis for disqualification, without something more, appears to be the exact type of shortcut in reasoning that is inappropriate in such cases of alleged apprehension."

Palmer, 1979 CanLII (SCC), [1980] S.C.R. 759; R. vs. Stolar, 1988 CanLIII 65 (Sask C.A.). 2)The court was not persuaded in the circumstances of this case that the trial judge either misapprehended or failed to take into account evidence which was before him in arriving at his conclusion concerning the causation of the fire. There was evidence which, if accepted, would permit the judge to make the findings of fact that he did and to award the damages based on those findings."

Changes in circumstances included the fact that the child was developmentally delayed and required a special program. A pediatrician testified that inconsistency in parenting approaches would further delay the child's development. HELD: Custody was awarded to the father. 1)Each parent was a capable caregiver. However, the father was available to provide full-time care due to an employment disability and exhibited a strong desire to do so. The past physical abuse of his former spouse was not considered relevant as it did not affect his ability to parent the child. 2)The mother was to have weekly access on two non-consecutive days for eight hours and two hours on a third day. The child was to sleep in the same bed every night.","HELD: The Custody Order was granted. The Court reviewed all of the evidence presented during the five-day trial. 1)Each parent was a capable caregiver. Each parent was awarded joint custody with the child living with each parent during alternative weeks. 2)Because of his employment disability, he remains available to provide full-time care for the child and exhibits a very strong desire to do so. 3)The Court was of the view that each parent was the capable parent of the child. The issues before me arose in the context of divorce action. Consequently, the provisions of ss. 1(1), (8), (9) and (10) of the Divorce Act apply."

HELD: 1) The petitioner's income is $73,000 versus $29,000 for the respondent. The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2) The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law. At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law. What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents? Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support? 2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.  3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse. These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI. These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case. However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future.","FIAT. The respondent moves for an order granting joint custody and primary care (residence) of the child with access to her former spouse. The parties agree that the established status quo of shared parenting shall also be included in this order.

9_2001canlii390.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over.08 contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The evidence of a strong smell of alcohol and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot was not sufficient to establish a breach of the accused's s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained. The accused was not guilty of the offence of impaired driving. The Court held that the Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which on balance would not have otherwise been discovered by alternative non-conscriptive means. The admission of it into evidence might well render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  1) In the absence of the certificate of analysis, the evidence is not sufficient for the accused to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence is impaired. 2) The Court concluded that the evidence was not reliable enough to establish that the accused was overtired, rather than being impaired by alcohol or drug. As well, the admission of the evidence would well render a remedy under s. 24(2) of The Charter. In this case, the accused is not guilty. 3) The Certificate of Analyses was not necessary to prove the offence under s253(a). The Court also concluded that there was no evidence of slurred speech. 4) The officer observed the accused sleeping through the two green traffic lights, activated the emergency lights on his vehicle, and went to check on the driver, with concern that he might be in some nature of physical distress. He identified the accused seated upright behind the wheel, wearing a bathing suit. He appeared to be sound asleep, or passed out. He was aware of the smell and alcohol coming from the accused. He grabbed him by the wrist, and the co-accused woke up immediately. Shortly thereafter, he was able to comprehend what was happening. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. He walked him back to the police vehicle and he did not observe any problems with balance or manner of walk.  5) The evidence was reliable and the accused did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand, which were read to him from a printed card. 6) The accused's eyes were somewhat bloodshot or glassy and his speech was slightly slurred. 7) Although the officer noted that the signs of impairment were quite obvious and visible"

An assessment recommended that the children live with the father and have access with the mother. Father granted interim sole care, custody and control of the children. The serious concerns raised by the assessment satisfied the threshold requirement of a material change in circumstances; the urgency of the concerns required immediate action.",This was an interim application to vary the terms of the 2001 Corollary Relief Judgment respecting parenting arrangements. The parties shared custody of the children. The respondent applied to vary seeking sole custody. He alleged ongoing conflict which adversely impacted on the children and sought to have the children placed in the primary care and custody of their father. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The urgency of these concerns required immediate action.  2)The evidence disclosed that the children's stress represents a developmental impediment. Both parents are capable parents. Individually they could be good parents. Together they have failed to act in the best interests of their children. They refuse to put aside their personal hurt and anger so as to benefit these distressed children. 3)The Court ordered an assessment and a report were completed in 2004. The report was completed in 2005. The children's present stress would be greater than the stress they would experience from scaling back the time they spent with the father. 4)The children's best interests were best served by a shared parenting arrangement.
b_2018skca27.txt,"HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed. The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced. The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one. She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence. The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony;  2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference. He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA. The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016. Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice. To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation.","The appellant was convicted after trial of sexually assaulting his 11-year-old niece contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to an 18 month custody and supervision order. The sentence appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was varied to 12 months probation. The appellant appealed the conviction appeal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The verdict in this case came down to a question of credibility. The trial judge failed to adhere to and properly apply the principles and purposes of sentencing pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, [YCJA], as the guiding legal principle in such circumstances. 2) The appellant had identified certain inconsistent statements in respect of which his counsel did not cross-examine the complainant. He has failed to establish these omissions amount to unreasonable professional judgment that reach the threshold of incompetence. 3) The evidence must meet the criteria for the admission of fresh evidence as set forth in Palmer (1979), 1979 CanLII (SCC), [1979) and [1980] SCR 827. 4) It is well understood that an appellate court must show 'great deference' to a trial judge's assessment of witness credibility. An appellate court may only interfere with sentence simply because it would have imposed a different sentence. However, this ground of appeal must be dismissed."
1997canlii11078.txt,"The applicant sought to be appointed as property guardian for his uncle pursuant to s19 of the Dependent Adults Act. The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years. The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs. He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951. Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew. There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property. However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit. His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest. 2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.  3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand. One half of the proceeds were to be provided directly to Hand to be dealt with as he chooses and the remaining half were to be administered by the Public Trustee in his longer term best interests according to the normal powers and procedures of that office.","The applicant sought the appointment of a property guardian pursuant to s. 19 of The Dependent Adults Act. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The applicant met the criteria set forth in s. 18 for appointment as property guardian for the applicant. 2)The application was in the best interests of the applicant and his immediate and recent memory. The family members were of the opinion that the applicant was incapable of prudently handling money or property, was functionally illiterate and was concerned that if the land was transferred to the applicant he would lose the benefit of the land in very short time. The applicant was entitled to manage his affairs unless he was not competent to do so. 3)The court reviewed the applicant's medical record and concluded that he was capable of managing his affairs and that some of the proceeds from the land sale should be placed directly into his control to pursue his financial commitments and hisdreams. The Public Trustee was to act as his property guardian in the longer term best interests."

The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report. HELD: Leave denied. Even if there was a scintilla of merit to the argument, the Court would not grant leave to appeal on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on an extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case.

The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995 seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable. In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations. In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice? This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues. The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer? 2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice. When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice. The applicant is entitled to a portion of the relief he seeks. The referendum held by the USSU on the issue of whether it should join the CFS is of no force or effect.","FIAT The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995, S.S. 1995, c. N-4.2 (“Act”) seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) In October 2005, the referendum was held within the student body of the University of Saskatchewan to determine if the university should join the Canadian Federation of Students and its related corporation, The CFS-S. The result favoured joining the federation. 2) In the interim, the respondent applied under s. 135(2)(b) of the Act to provide an expansive definition of election so as to encompass a referendum by a non-profit corporation seeking membership in a third party. The applicant applied under the non-profit corporation provisions of the 1995 Act. The net result was set aside. 3) The respondent was given the task of ratifying the CFS membership referendum results. In this case, it would be counterintuitive not to add CFS as a party to the application. 4) There was no question CFS had an interest in the subject matter and could be adversely affected by the judgment. 5) The respondents also referred to Leroux v. Molgat, 1985 CanLII 229 (BC SC), [1985] B.C. J. No. 45 (QL), where Justice McLachlin (as she then was) summarized the relevant legal principles with respect to the setting aside of the results of an election. 6) In this jurisdiction such relief is discretionary.

Baker and Smishek (1902), 18 M.P.L.R. 27 (Sask. C.A.), the court reviewed the issues in cases dealing with controverted elections for elected office and concluded that it was not necessary to address those complaints. 8) The applicant was awarded prospective membership and advised that in order to achieve full membership in CFS it was necessary for the USSU to conduct referendum within its student body. If the applicant does have standing, is he entitled to the relief sought? 9) The conduct complained of by the applicant falls within the ambit of s. 225(1).

6_1999skqb124.txt,"The plaintiff who had been employed by the defendant's predecessor for 23 years as office manager and bookkeeper until 1997, brought an action for damages against her new employers for dismissal without adequate notice. The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998. The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period. Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause. Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time. Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. She remained entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at the time of termination and to medical expenses that would have been covered but without bonuses or extra payments for sick pay. 2)The defendant did not establish the plaintiff ought to have done more to mitigate her loss. There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.  3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment. Amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant were to be deducted. 4)The plaintiff was entitled to interest in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 5)The defendant could make no deduction for insurance benefit payments. Sections 45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act was drawn to their attention. 6)The plaintiff was awarded costs. Fees were to be taxed on column 2. 7)The plaintiff was to deliver a copy of the calculation of the judgment. Either could issue judgment with the other's consent as to form and content.

The plaintiff had been employed by Saxby Welding for 23 years and had become the office manager, bookkeeper and, generally, the key office person. Her role included decision making, especially in matters relating to the accounts. The defendants were involved in a relationship that was cool and doomed to termination. The conduct to which she refers may be viewed as constructive dismissal and was accepted as such by the plaintiff by letter on May 25, 1998. But her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. The employer is entitled to the benefit of the services of its employee during the period of notice but acts of the employee during this period constitute bad feelings. The defendant can therefore make no deduction for any such insurance payments made to the plaintiff. If the parties do not agree on the amount thereof the matter may be referred to me by application for further directions."

The evidence before the chambers judge was meagre but showed that the father had not seen the child for the past four years. The mother appealed., appeal dismissed; the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act. He did not place too much emphasis on the child's loss of a potential relationship with and support from the father on the facts of this case.","The single mother appealed the November 2004 decision of the Children and Family Services Court refusing to grant her the adoption she sought with respect to her four year old daughter. She argued the chambers judge erred in placing too much emphasis on the child's loss of her possible relationship with and support from her father. The chambers judge did not err when he balanced the neutral impact the child would have on the appellant's relationship with her father against the loss of possible contact, support and inheritance. He agreed that the father was not entitled to notice and was not required to consent to the adoption as result of the interplay between s. 67(1)(f) of the Act and the extended families of either parent. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The facts are scant, as acknowledged by the appellant, because the only evidence before the Chambers judge was the usual documentation provided to court with an application for an uncontested adoption. 2) Without the adoption the child will continue to be in exactly the same position in terms of her relationship with the appellant whether the adoption is granted or not. The adoption will not change that relationship.  3) The appellant did not satisfy on the meagre facts available to him that he failed to take into account the applicable enumerated factors set out in s3(2)(n) in determining whether the proposed adoption was in the best interests of the child.  4) The Chamber judge refused to grant the adoption on the basis that it was not in the child’s best interests to do so even though he found all of the technical requirements for the adoption had been complied with. 5) There was no evidence as to why there had been no contact between the child and her father since November 2000 or whether he was or is presently able to provide financial support for her and whether the appellant ever sought child support. It is not known if the appellant and the child have lived with the father or anyone else or if there is contact between them and their extended families. We do not know how the child was supported from November 2000 when the father ceased support until February 2003 when the appellant started her present job."
2_2003skpc44.txt,"The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b). Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600. The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'. The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on. The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement. Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair. The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts. At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven. 1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA. If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group. Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive. It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so. The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation. It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time). 3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character. 4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period. The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product. The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed.","This issue largely involved Part III of The Consumer Protection Act and inter alia, the question of whether or not a consignee is a'retail seller' as defined in that Part. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $1542.35 plus costs of $20 for a total of $1563.35. 1)The plaintiff did not reject the goods within a reasonable period. He was entitled to recover the purchase price of $1600 plus foreseeable damages. The costs incurred for repairs and inspection were foreseeable and properly recoverable.  2)The vehicle was driven almost 5,000 kilometres before the seriousness of the problem was discovered. The remuneration to Triple was to be 10% of the selling price. 3)In the circumstances, the plaintiff was a retail seller within the meaning of the Act and accordingly that Triple R is deemed to have given to the plaintiff the warranties set out in the Act. 4)The court found support for the notion that persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in the Latin phrase Expressio Unius.

The court ordered that the property be sold and the proceeds of sale take into account the amount necessary to protect the respondent father’s claim. The Partition Act, 1868 applies in the province. It did not allow the equitable principles of unjust enrichment and constructive trust to operate to create a proprietary interest. The court found that s. 4 of the Act applied, which provides a monetary remedy so that if the respondent father could establish entitlement to some amount for his maintenance and improvement costs, he would be protected for that amount for his costs.","HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the parties had a prima facie right to partition and sale of the lake front recreational property owned by them together with their brother and sister. The parties had an undivided one quarter interest as tenants in common in the property. The property was located next door to another that until recently was the permanent residence of the Applicants' parents. They are now separated. The Court reviewed the circumstances of each case and found that, in seeking partition, the court may make all just allowances and should give such directions as will do complete equity between the parties. It was also found that there was a de facto burden of proof placed on the defendant to show the reason why the enrichment should be retained. This was a category of residual defence in which courts can look to all of the circumstances in order to determine whether there is another reason to deny recovery."

e_2005skqb549.txt,"There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor-client basis. There was no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue was whether the plaintiff was entitled to the summary relief which she now sought. HELD: The plaintiff's motion does not require the defendant to'make any payment to purchase' or to'redeem any redeemable shares'. The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s34(2) of the Business Corporations Act.  1) There is no dispute that the defendants, and particularly Peak Enterprises Inc., have failed to present reasonable grounds for believing that the corporation is or would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or otherwise. The defendants have not provided any professional analysis or affidavit evidence in support of their proposition that s34 is applicable. 2) The affidavit of Donald Beveridge, sworn on July 15, 2005, did not require Peak to make any payments to purchase or redeem the shares issued by it. The cross-examination of the defendant on his affidavit disclosed that Peak is a profitable company and that the realizable value of Peak's assets would be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and the amount that would be required to be paid to other shareholders who have right to be compensated on redemption or in liquidation, rateably with or prior to the holders of the shares to be purchased or redeemed. 3) Peak does not have possession of any share certificates in Ascent and the Court may direct judgment under subrule (1) to be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. 4) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff in the amount of $8,500 is $214,600. It is this amount which she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment application. 5) The Court is of the view that s.34(1) does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the Court. The Act does not prevent the defendant from making a payment to redeem shares, in essence, but rather, following judgment however and whenever it is necessary to be a shareholder of Peak in conjunction with its claim for the unpaid Dividends against Peak. Peak is prohibited by s. 34(2). 6) The court is not in the position to determine if the plaintiff is entitled"

The appellants appealed. They argued that the trial judge, by measuring the respondent's loss on the basis that he should be put in the position he would have been if the financial statements had been accurate, had applied the wrong test. Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600, that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages. The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company. The damages are the amount by which the actual value of the company was less than what the respondent paid at the time of purchase.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages flowing from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business. The appellant was a businessman living in Port Hawkesbury and the numbered company was owned by him and the respondent numbered. The respondent numbered company sold and serviced cash registers and point of sale equipment. It required a large inventory of parts and equipment to operate. The company had performed well in the Atlantic Provinces but had suffered from severe cash flow problems. The trial judge found that the appellant never would have purchased ABM had he known the true financial condition of the company. The exercise therefore was to fix the damages so as to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been had he not invested in ABM. The damages were prima facie the amount by which the actual value of ABM was less than what the respondent paid for it. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part as it was the test for measuring damages for breach of a contractual warranty.  1)The trial judge had measured the loss on the footing that the respondent should be put in. This, being the test, was not the correct test. 2)The Court was not satisfied that the trial judge's assessment of the loss was correct. The Court was unable to determine the exact extent of the respondent's loss as a result of the misrepresentations made by the financial statements. 3)It was impossible to perform that reconstruction. There are too many variables, many of which were not addressed in the evidence, presumably because the parties were satisfied that an attempt to unravel the transaction and establish the clients' position on the assumption the transaction had not occurred was so complicated as to defy performance."

HELD: 1) There shall be an order directing a trial to prove the last will of Roland Linkert.  2) There is a general principle of probate law emanating from the case of Barry v. Butlin (1838), 12 E.R. 1089. It is not necessary to have the viva voce evidence of Violet Beaudry on this application. 3) The testator was not induced by undue influence to sign the will but the court must scrutinize the evidence closely in light of the suspicion to determine whether undue influence ought to be drawn.  4) Yvonne Tyler asks that the will be proven in a solemn form.

The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently.","HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused had two previous convictions of sexual interference on children, one for assault and one for sexual interference.

The Court of Appeal reduced the sentence to 30 months imprisonment, with a conditional sentence order for a'serious personal injury offence' which carried a maximum penalty of 10 years, when that offence was prosecuted by indictment. The court found that the accused was at a low risk to re-offend as there had been 14 years since the accused's last conviction for sexual assault."

HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter. The obligation to disclose is not absolute. The Corwn's obligation to protect the privacy of the complainants is fulfuilled by providing the statements and videotapes to counsel for the accused on trust condition that counsel retain them in his possession. The information contained therein is available to the accused and retained experts for use in preparing his defence. Since the accused knows the sustance of the complaints and, therefore, the case he has to meet, there is no danger to the fairness of the trial by virtue of the trust condition attached to disclosure. The public interest is served and the integrity of the criminal justice system is maintained when complainants are assured that staements and videotapes will not be reproduced. Application dismissed.","FIAT The accused applied for a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter and s. 650(3) of The Criminal Code compelling the respondent to provide full and complete disclosure to him.

The trust conditions attached to disclosure by the Crown in this case were reasonable and strike a balance between the right to disclosure and the rights of alleged victims, it being recognized that a right to fair trial is paramount. 4)The only issue for determination was whether the imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of the victims' statements would prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence."
e_2013skqb434.txt,HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.,"The sole issue presented by this application is whether the lawyers with Phillips Co. should be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff because of a conflict of interest. At its core, the action between Pearce-Ell and the Holgates pertains to the terms of the agreement for sale, which is the same matter, or at the very least, a related matter to the original retainer. That alone is sufficient to justify their disqualification. The same result is achieved by applying the Martin principles and presumptions. As Mr. Phillips possessed relevant confidential information from a former client which could prejudice them in the within action, disqualification is generally automatic. HELD: 1) There is no evidence that a solicitor-client relationship exists between the law firm and the plaintiffs. The law firm has failed to rebut the presumption that confidential information was imparted to the lawyers in that law firm. There is a risk the confidential information will be used to prejudice that client. 2) It is not the job of this Court to pass upon lawyer's adherence to the Code, nor to punish or discipline lawyers. It must be recalled that the duty to avoid conflicts is simply an adjunct to a lawyer's underlying duty to refrain from using confidential information received from former clients. In practice, Rule 2.04(10) operates to prevent situations from arising which carry a heightened risk of breach of confidentiality. 3) The law is clear that it is to be viewed from the vantage point of the client not the lawyer. The former client need only satisfy the court of its broad relevance to the proceedings at hand and of the risk posed if it passed into the hands of the other party. The Court should not require client to disclose what information or types of information it seeks to protect or to explain how such information may be relevant to proceedings. 4) The Court must consider the matter with an eye to and concern for the administration of justice and any appearance of impropriety."

The complainant swore she tried to flee several times after the melee in the hotel room, but the defendant physically prevented her from doing so. The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The Crown had proven each required element of this offence beyond a reasonable doubt. During the events at the Coachman Hotel in Regina, the defendant threatened to kill the complainant, and the defendant was guilty of this charge. The Court found that the defendant knew the complainant was trying to leave the hotel, and that she was in a 'cocaine psychosis' (his term), and that he was going to kill her.

d_1996canlii7113.txt,"The question was whether a corporate board could breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government sponsored community bond program in order to establish its business. The Shareholders' Agreement obliged all shareholders to vote their shares so as to confirm the nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard for its performance. As a result the board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though the Government of Saskatchewan and Bondco were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the company, they could not change the board and did not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes. Members of Bondco were concerned that jobs were being obtained in Saskatoon at the expense of Rosetown jobs and the economic spin-offs expected from their $800,000 investment were not being realized in Rosetown due to the opening of the Saskatoon facility.

The purpose of the order now made is to place him on notice that the will of the shareholders and the contracts under which the company was formed are not to be brushed aside. 2)The shareholders' agreement was amended by de-deleting paragraph 3. Board of Directors and substituting the words 'therefor'. This was an unusual restriction. The board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though Bondco and eventually the Government of Saskatchewan are entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the board, they cannot change the board and if they try to dictate policy they do not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes. 3)The Court was directed to make an order to rectify the matters complained of."

The bankrupt supported four children and had been discharged from the military due to illness arising from her active service. The bankrupt will be entitled to an absolute discharge once certain conditions are met, including the payment of one month's rent, the value of the horses and surplus income for nine months to the Trustee. The bankrupt's disability pension from Veterans' Affairs was not included in the calculation of surplus income as the public policy reason behind the exemption for proceeds received due to personal injury and a soldier's danger pay applied to this disability pension. The Trustee had no claim to the insurance proceeds received by the bankrupt following the loss of her home by fire as it was a modest sum used to replace lost personal exempt assets; the three horses were found to be owned by the bankrupt as opposed to her children, for whom she had purchased them as pets and were included in the value of her estate; the court exercised its discretion in determining the amount of surplus income, noting that the administration of the estate had been unusually hostile and it was important that the bankrupt be able to stabilize her family finances.","The applicant sought an absolute discharge from bankruptcy. She owned a ride-on lawnmower and horse trailer. She had been discharged from military service in 2003 because of illness arising from active service.

There is. This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application. There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community.

HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed. 1)The originating notice was served on the defendant based on the affidavit of service he swore but he had no recollection of the particular service. He did recall one incident concerning service on Mr. MacLean but that is understandable given the number of documents he serves.  2)The defendant's affidavit does not set out acts upon which in the words of Ives v. Dewar would clearly indicate he had good defence to the action on the merits; not necessarily defence which would succeed at trial because the action was not being tried on the application, but facts which would show beyond a question that there was a substantial issue between the parties to be tried."
e_2012skpc80.txt,The accused was charged with two counts being driving while impaired contrary to s. 253(1)(a) and refusal to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code. The Court had earlier acquitted the accused on the charge of driving while disqualified as there was no evidence regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence. At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code. The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court. There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.,The accused was charged with impaired driving and failure to provide breath samples contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue before the court was whether the GiO cycle which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Code. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges.  1)The accused had been a member of the Regina Police Service for four and one half years. He was on general patrol duty in his police vehicle which was proceeding westbound on Saskatchewan Drive. As the police vehicle approached the intersection of Broad Street and Broad Street against a red light he observed a motorcyclist operating a moped. The moped had an electric motor under the seat. The accused indicated that he was pedaling the bike with both of his feet being close to the ground rather than resting on the floor board as the electric motor powered the bike. The officer testified that he observed the accused stumble and sway from side to side while driving the moped and that the accused appeared to be dragging his feet while driving. 2)The Crown failed to prove the accused's motor vehicle was motor vehicle. The Crown must prove that Mr. Rookes' GiO bike was an electric bicycle. The court found the accused guilty of operating the motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drug. 3)The court found that the offence was not under s.253(1(a) and s.254(5) as the accused had failed to provide samples of his breath for analysis. 4)The Court found that there were no errors in the test results. The test results did not support the Crown's argument that the motor was not operating at the time of the offence. 5)There was no evidence that the electric vehicle was operational that evening. There was also no evidence the accused dragged his feet when he was driving. The Court also noted that the RCMP testified that they did not have a warrant to search the premises of the accused.
5_2005skqb219.txt,"The accused has been in custody since November 17, 2004. After show cause hearings, the court refused to release the accused from detention. The accused apply for a review of the detention orders. HELD: 1) A review of the detention orders would ordinarily be cursory and the applications dismissed. The reasons for the decisions to refuse to release the accused cannot seriously be questioned. 2) However, a factor that causes concern is that 6 months after their arrest, not only has a preliminary hearing not been conducted, no date for a preliminary hearing has been set. No preliminary hearing date will be set before May 2005. The preliminary hearing will take 2 to 3 weeks.  It seems unlikely that the trial of these individuals will take place within a year of the date of their arrest. 3) They are ordered released on terms and upon the filing of security in the amount of $1,000.","The accused were charged with a multitude of offences pursuant to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.S. 1996, c.19 and the Criminal Code, which include trafficking in cocaine and methamphetamine, conspiracy to do so with one another and several other individuals, and several Criminal Code offences, including possession of proceeds of crime. Both individuals have been in custody since November 2004. HELD: The accused were released on a recognizance. 1) The accused was released on conditions including that he would not enter a public premise which served alcoholic beverages and that he was using an alias when arrested. 2) There was a substantial likelihood that the accused would, if released from custody, commit a criminal offence. 3) A review of the detention orders of Her Honour Judge McMurtry and her Honour Judge Snell would ordinarily be cursory. However, the conclusion of the judge cannot be seriously questioned. 4) File with the court security in the amount of $1,000.00 cash. The accused had been convicted of 13 breaking and entering, theft, assault, three charges of failing to comply with undertakings, and one charge of being unlawfully at large. He had a significant youth court record. He was convicted of two assault causing bodily harm charges, possession of house breaking instrument charge, charge of mischief, and a charge of breaching a peace officer checking a curfew. In May 2004, an investigation into cocaine and meth trafficking in Regina was commenced. At the time of the accused's arrest he was facing outstanding charges, and arrest warrants, in Manitoba, and drug related charges in Alberta. His release was denied."
e_2014skqb265.txt,The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and operating a motor vehicle when the concentration of alcohol in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams. The accused challenged the reasonableness of the investigating officer's suspicion upon which the officer based his ASD demand. The Crown appealed the acquittals of both of the charges. The trial judge specifically found that the accused relied only on three factors in forming his suspicion. HELD: The appeal concerns whether that suspicion, based on the facts as found by the trial judge, satisfies the objective requirement of s. 254(2)(b). There is no basis for disturbing this finding of fact.  1) The Court reviewed the meaning of reasonable suspicion set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Duguay, [1996] SCC 35 (CanLII), [2009] S.C.R. 527. 2) The court found that, in determining there were not reasonable grounds for a reasonable grounds to suspect that a person has alcohol in their body and that the ASD demand was not based on reasonable suspicion, it is violation of the accused's rights under ss. and of the Charter. The Court found that Cst. Kowalenko, through haste or carelessness, did not carry out his responsibilities and should have done further investigation before 'leaping straight to demand that the complainant provide incriminating evidence against himself'. There is a finding of facts. There is an absence of factors that actually led the officer to his belief. The nervousness and lack of desire to explain what he was doing and the fact this incident occurred at 5:12 in the morning are not factors that will be taken into account in determining the reasonability of the suspicion. The time of the incident is only relevant to the extent it provides context to the other factors.  2) Where a reasonable person, placed in the shoes of a police officer, would not conclude on these facts that a suspicion is not reasonable, there was a violation of Mr. Plantje's s. and s. Charter rights under s. 24(2). The Court concluded that the Court's finding that the suspicion was not reasonable and that there was no other reason for detaining the accused, there is a reasonable requirement that the officer satisfy s.254(2(b). The court concluded that it was not satisfied that the appellant had the requisite reasonable suspicion to make an approved screening device demand."

HELD: The sentence was varied by reducing the term of probation to 1 year and by deleting the provisions concerning possession and consumption of alcohol, entry into premises where alcohol is sold and consumed, and submission to breath or blood testing. A period of probation was appropriate but 3 years was out of proportion to the nature of the offence. The inclusion of a term prohibiting him from consuming alcohol was inappropriate since it had no relation to the purpose of the original recognizance.","The offence was breach of a recognizance made under the authority of s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code, the purpose of which is to prevent further sexual offences against persons under the age of 14 years. The Crown admitted that there was no nexus between consumption of alcohol on the part of the appellant and his propensity to paedophilia. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence was varied by reducing the term of probation to one year and by deleting the provisions concerning possession and consumption of beer, entry into premises where alcohol is sold and consumed, and submission to breath or blood testing. The term of the probation, three years, was out of proportion to the nature of the offence. The terms of the period of probation, 3 years, were out of all proportion."
c_1998canlii14058.txt,"FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act. The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability. The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher. HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act. 2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver. The reasoning in Neault was directly on point. Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act. The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers. The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute. 4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer. The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.","FIAT. The plaintiff was a student at a school operated by the defendant school board and the co-defendant was the teacher within the meaning of the provisions of the Education Act. At all material times the automobile was not stolen or otherwise wrongfully taken out of the possession of the defendant and the owner of the motor vehicle was liable for the plaintiff's injuries. In the event Edith Larsen is immune from liability by s. 228 of The Highway Traffic Act, the school board is liable to the plaintiff for bodily injury, loss and damage caused by the negligence of the negligent driver. HELD: The Education Act is the general statute dealing with teacher's liability and immunity in a general way. The immunity only applies to schoolteachers and principals. 1)In this case the plaintiff was immune. There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. The legislation provides that negligent teacher/driver is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of s.228 of The Act. Even if there were an apparent conflict with the two statutes, careful analysis would lead one to conclude that the Highway Traffic act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of the same s. 86(1) of the Act. 2)In the event the teacher was not liable, the board is immune."
5_2004skqb417.txt,"Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999. The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month. The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000. The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley. The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school. The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000. She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return. The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income. To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding. The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years. The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2) The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922. This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources. It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount. Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income. This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376. However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424. The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410. It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003. This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952. Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.  3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345. It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support. Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.  4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003. In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes. The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003. Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so. She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.  5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract. Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed. 6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment. Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","Each party applied for a variation of the 1999 child support judgment. The parties separated in 1997 and shortly thereafter Mr. Marzolf moved to Alberta. The 1999 judgment contained the terms of an Interspousal Contract which provided for basic child support to be paid by the respondent in the amount of $1,411 per month. The respondent commenced negotiations in 2002 for an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that his income was significantly higher than $110,000. On the same basis she also sought a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) Given the various sources of income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is reasonable to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of child support payable in the subsequent year. It is reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003.  2) Based on the Guidelines and an annual income of $248,952.25 the respondent has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for the child than does the respondent. Given the unpredictable, variable and to some degree speculative aspect of much of the respondent's income such that she has not had the resources to provide lifestyle similar to the one they enjoyed prior to their parent's separation. In these circumstances, she was not in a position to withdraw from her parents' support. 3) The Guideline amount or some other amount should be used to calculate child support on income in excess of $150,000 without interruption to June 30, 2003. Given Ashley's limited ability to earn income during her short hiatus from school and considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parents to contribute to her support it is appropriate that support be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority."
d_1998canlii4665.txt,"The primary issue in this appeal was the standard of review to be applied on appeals from a Hearing Officer to the Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal. The appellant had his appeal denied on the grounds that the decision of the Hearing Officer was not patently unreasonable. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for re-hearing, that an appeal from a Hearing Officer to the Tribunal is a statutory appeal. It is not a judicial review, and the standard of review is therefore one of correctness not whether or not the Hearing Officer's decision was patently unreasonable. The deference that the Tribunal must show is only with respect to the advantages the Hearing Officer may have in the fact finding process of a particular case.","This was an appeal for which leave had been granted from a Worker's Compensation Appeals Tribunal decision dated October 25, 1996. It was limited to a question as to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The concept of patently unreasonable decision had no place in this statutory appeal process. The appeal was allowed and the matter was remitted to the Tribunal as per oral reasons. HELD: An appeal from the hearing officer to the tribunal is a statutory appeal. It is not a judicial review. It has no place within this statutory appeals process. There is no reason to think that the Tribunal is any less expert generally in matters relating to workers' compensation that fall within s. 243(7) than it does. The Tribunal must, in such cases, afford the usual appellate deference to trier of fact. Support for this approach can be found in the very wide scope of the appeal and the appeal is allowed. The matter is remitted. 1)The basis for dismissing the appellant's appeal was the Tribunal's conclusion that the Hearing Officer did not arrive at a decision which was patently unreasonably unreasonable. It employed the language of the tribunal employed in expressing this conclusion. 2)Do not find it patently reasonable that a hearing officer found that the inference the Worker was seeking was not reasonable one. The inference being sought by the worker is that his knee problem arose out of and in the course of his employment. The medical evidence did not support the inference that the worker was seeking. Do not have to find that would reach the same conclusion that she reached."

The estate counterclaimed for a mortgage debt incurred by the father on behalf of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not included in his father's Will as a beneficiary and the Will contained no reference to the mortgage debt. The father's statement of assets filed in his divorce and matrimonial property action did not disclose it as an asset. HELD: 1)The unsigned handwritten memorandum evidenced a binding agreement for lease between the plaintiff and his father. He affirmed the lease in his discussions with a daughter. 2)The plaintiff neither repudiated the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it.  The fact that he did not vigorously contest the right of his brother to farm the land on behalf of the estate did not estop him from suing for damages for his father's breach of the lease.  Damages of $6,500 were awarded. 3)The plaintiff failed to establish a quantum meruit claim. He did not produce any documents to show he had been reimbursed for his labour on the farm in prior years. Other family members helped with the farming from time to time. He did nothing while his father was alive to demand or obtain payment. 4)Even if the mortgage was considered a debt in 1989 it was subsequently forgiven. It was significant that the plaintiff was not included as a beneficiary and the amount of the mortgage was similar to the bequests to the other children. 5)The plaintiff was awarded his costs against the estate on a party and party basis for that portion of his claim on which he was successful and for defending the counterclaim. Solicitor and client costs against the estate were not appropriate as the issues raised by the claim and counterclaim were not typical estate issues.

The court ordered that the child should be placed in the custody of J.A.’s mother as a person of sufficient interest for a period of four months pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act. The child’s parents should have adequate access to build their relationship with him and to allow them, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to eventually care for their child.","HELD: The order was made under s. 23 of the Child and Family Services Act. The child was in need of protection. The parents were not able to care for the child. The plan was to return the child to the parents' care in the same location as on November 23, 2015 with the support of grandmother TK and a friend and neighbour of BA's. The mother was not a person of sufficient interest and the plan was not approved by the Minister of Social Services. The father had diminished cognitive abilities, as she suffers from FASD, and as a result she has challenges around understanding and retaining information, despite presenting as though this is not the case.

2_2006nsfc7.txt,"Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances. When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care. The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability. The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children. Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication.","The mother applied for a change in the primary care arrangements for the two children. Pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act, the mother applies to vary in order to preserve the present arrangement vesting primary and day care and control of the children with him, subject to access times with their mother. The father is currently employed as roofer and is unable to drive a motor vehicle, having accumulated myriad of driving infractions to add to his already lengthy criminal record. The mother continues to make harassing phone calls to him, his sister and other family members and friends. HELD: The Court found that the children were at considerable risk if placed in primary care or control of either parent as the mother's habit of smoking drugs regularly, and financially supporting a drug habit, this will automatically divert from already meager funds available to adequately provide amenities for their children.  1) The mother's plan is well conceived; however, it is the execution of her plan which causes concern for the Court. Rhetorically, it must be asked if she can withstand the daily pressure of raising two active boys, especially when this is coupled with the ongoing strain of poor relations with the father. 2) There are other examples ( boys missing school, etc. without a valid reason, at the whim of their father) described in the evidence which could be recounted here. 3) The parents' past habit of consuming alcohol while taking prescribed medication has compromised their emotional bond with the children. These concerns encapsulate a conglomerate of parental missteps and deficiencies."

b_2002nsca30.txt,"A fifteen year old died in a motor vehicle accident. The estate brought a claim for loss of future income and lost earning capacity. The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed. Appeal dismissed; the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.","Where a person is killed due to the fault of another, the person's estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in an actual pecuniary loss to the estate. This is a rich and complicated background against which they must be interpreted. The Nova Scotia survival of actions legislation contained several exclusions and limitations not found in the earlier Ontario and English legislation. The appellants relied on allegedly wrongful acts of the respondent for which the respondent could have sued had he been injured rather than killed. The deceased's dependants had no separate claim for the loss of support suffered directly by them as result of the wrongful act because no cause of action for wrongful death was recognized. Their only option was to sue for damages for loss of expectation of life. HELD: The Court dismissed the appeal. 1) There was no trial in this matter. The facts before the Court are those agreed to by the parties for the limited purpose of resolving a preliminary point of law. The law limits the types of damages that are recoverable and the definition of the persons for whose benefit the action may be brought. 2) There is a common law rule in Nova Scotia that all causes of action subsisting against or vested in a person, except for defamation, survived and could be asserted after death by the deceased's personal representatives. 3) In Nova Scotia, the Court found that the estate was not entitled to do so because loss of its future earning capacity does not constitute an 'actual pecuniaiary loss' as required by the Survival of Actions Act. There was a limitation on damages set out in s. 1(1) of the 1954 Act that permitted this claim to be asserted by the personal representatives of the deceased. It also allowed recovery of damages for the guidance, care and companionship which the deceased would have received had he lived and continued to provide support.  4) The Court reviewed the various provincial and territorial enactments and, among other things, the House of Lords decision in Rose v. Ford and the Ontario amendments of 1938 in response to it. The Court of Appeal agreed that no such damages could be awarded in this case. 5) Nova Scotia legislation does not do away entirely with common law. Rather, it only modifies the rule in specific ways."

It also properly registered against her trade name, 'Joan E. Craft Supplies'. After her assignment in bankruptcy, the trustee disallowed Sedco's security on the basis that its registration was defective. Sedco appealed this decision under section 135 of the Bankruptcy Act. ISSUES: 1)Did Sedco register its interest in accordance with the PPSA Regulations? 2)If not, can the registration be cured under section 66 of the PPSA? HELD: 1)The personal registration did not comply with the PPSA Regulations. The registration against the trade name was proper. 2)This is a matter where section 66 should be applied. To hold otherwise would result in an undeserving windfall to unsecured creditors who have not been mislead.","The applicant applied for an order pursuant to s. 135(4) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act granting the applicant's appeal of the trustee's decision to disallow her security interest. The ground on which this application is brought is that the applicant\'s security interest was not registered defectively, according to the Personal Property Security ActRegulations. In the alternative, s. 66(1) should be applied to remedy such defect. HELD: The application was allowed. 1)In the alternative the registration against the applicant did not comply with the Regulations.  2)The applicant was the only secured party and the trustee had notice of the security interest and the security agreement was both executed in the same manner. 3)The trustee appeared late on the scene and has never incurred any risk. It never acted on the financing statement containing the error. The trustee has not been misled, had not been prejudiced and has not acted to its detriment. 4)To hold otherwise would result in an underserving windfall to unsecured creditors who have been misled. 5)The respondent registered a secured party claim for $4,105.91 on the ground that it did not properly register its security interest in the form of a security agreement. 6)The registration of the secured party did not interfere with the application of the applicant. 7)The Court reviewed every proof of claim or proof of security and the grounds therefor and may require further evidence."
2_2007nsca122.txt,"Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas. He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision. She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here. She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned. Application for stay pending appeal dismissed; the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here. Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there. Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20.","The appellant appeals from and applies for a stay of execution of an order setting aside her petition for divorce. On an application by the respondent to set aside the divorce petition on the basis that Nova Scotia lacked jurisdiction, Justice Wilson determined that the appellant had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year prior to filing the petition, as required by s.3 of the Divorce Act. Pursuant to that statute, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the respondent's habitual residence and if the appellant was wrongfully retaining the child, the appellant would be required to pay child support. HELD: The application for stay pending appeal is dismissed. 1) The irreparable harm claimed by the appellant is at this point entirely speculative. If the order under appeal is not one which lends itself to being stayed in accordance with Rule 62.10, that order would have to be registered with Nova Scotia to be enforced.  2) Since Nova Scotia is not a reciprocating state pursuant to the Reciprocal Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1989, R.S.N.S., c. 67 which implements the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction would be applicable. 3) The respondent is essentially asking for an interim order temporarily allowing the appeal. Until such time as there is a resolution of the conflicts of law issue, it would be risky not to participate in the process there."

However there was no suggestion of dishonesty. The combined medical earnings in the four years prior to the bankruptcy averaged $18,000 per month and the after-tax family income averaged $10,200 per month.

The trustee ordered a judgment in favour of the bankrupt in the amount of $45,000 to apply to the bankrupt's secured claim. HELD: 1)The judgment was not enforced so long as the bankrupt pays to the trustee the sum of $1,250 per month on the first day of each and every month for a total of 36 months. The judgment will not bear interest. Based on Revenue Canada's Superintendents Guideline of Payments (which I take into account along with all other factors), the trustee shall apply the said payments firstly in payment of its reasonable fees and distribute the balance from time to time pro rata amongst the creditors.

Each party will bear their own costs; the court had no confidence that any offer made by either party, short of 100 per cent vindication, could have resolved the case in advance of trial.","Civil Procedure Rule 63.02 addresses costs generally. It is important that courts support Rule 41A offers when assessing costs post trial. In this particular case I have no confidence that any offer made by either the plaintiff or the defendant, short of 100% vindication, would have resolved this case in advance of trial. The intent of rule 41A is to induce settlements and avoid trials. There should be a departure from the prima facie operation of the rule only where the interests of justice clearly require it.

2_2007nssc40.txt,"Following the collapse of the roofs of two buildings in Newfoundland, both of which were constructed with open web steel joists fabricated by the same company, the Nova Scotia government wrote to owners of buildings containing these joists, including the plaintiff mall owner, recommending that the joists be inspected by a qualified professional engineer. An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended. The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists. The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger. Judgment for the plaintiff; there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger. There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.","The Mayflower Mall was constructed in 1979. The owners concerned with safety issues arising from the report recommended that open web steel joists be inspected by qualified professional engineers. The owner of the mall claimed against United Dominion Industries Corporation, of which Robb Engineering was a division, for the cost of the inspection and remediation of the Mall. HELD: 1) The actual repairs were necessary, but the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not necessary to repair defects to the joist and mitigate the danger. 2) The owners followed the recommendations of the report, followed the consultants' recommendation and undertook remediation. 3) The amount of work in the plant determined how much time and effort it would take to complete the inspection. 4) The quality of the welds was poor with weld failures and poor fit up noted throughout. 5) There was a marked increase in failures above length category 4. 6. The average for buildings inspected in Nova Scotia containing Robb joists was 2.28%. In buildings that had satisfactorily performed for twenty years and had a strict quality control program, such as the one implemented by the Department of Transportation and Public Works for the Government's own buildings, this clearly cannot be performed successfully on welds which are masked by slag deposits. 6) There were issues regarding the control of the quality of welding during the fabrication of joists. The issue was whether there was a real and substantial danger to the occupants of the building. The report set out a proposed remediation scheme, which was based on a recommendation by the Nova Scotia Department of transportation and Public works for the government's own building. 7) The respondents followed the report. The respondents were concerned about safety issues. The Nova Scotia report recommended all joists fabricated by Robb Engineering be inspected to allow for routine inspection for weld quality and weld length. Although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the 'open web steel' joists were necessary and were subsequently inspected by MPI until we have the assurance that the defects are addressed, additional remediation may be advisable around the or 10 length and above. The evidence for all parties is cracked or missing welds and must be repaired."

This was an interlocutory, discretionary decision and the chambers judge did not apply a wrong principle of law or make a clearly erroneous finding of fact, nor has there been a patent injustice. A decision on the corollary issue of whether the proceeding should have taken place under Rule 4.07 (dismissal for want of jurisdiction) or Rule 88.02 (abuse of process) is unnecessary.","An appeal from an interlocutory and discretionary decision is only available if the Chambers judge applied a wrong principle of law or made a clearly erroneous finding of fact, or a failure to intervene would give rise to a patent injustice. Rule 4.07 for dismissal for want of jurisdiction or Rule 88.02 for abuse of process is the equivalent 1972 Rule (14.25(d)) invoked in Marineserve. The respondent appealed the decision of a Chambers judge refusing to grant a stay of proceedings. The Chambers judge defined the issue as whether Mr. Newton had attorned to the Court's jurisdiction. He found that he had. The court recognized that timeliness was an issue but was satisfied that Maritime Harbours raised the question of arbitration at an early stage; In Marineserve, Justice Goodfellow characterized the litigation as 'not yet out of the starting gate' and denied the substance of the claim as well."

HELD: The applications were dismissed with each defendant to recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff. Although the defendants' pleading may delay but not defeat or prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with its foreclosure action, the defences were so closely connected with the plaintiff's demands that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking the defendant's defences into consideration.","FIAT.

FCC and National financing is secured by mortgages against the titles to the pig barns. Within a year both corporations were in default in their loan payments and the lenders took action. FCC gave notice of its intention to realize on its security. National arranged for the appointment of a receiver. HELD: Both applications were dismissed. Although the facts and circumstances in each case are virtually identical, the complexity of them makes it appropriate that each defendant recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff. The defences advanced by National are, as was the situation in the 663073 Alberta Ltd. case, so closely connected with FCC's demands that it would be manifestly unjust for FCC to proceed without taking National's defences into consideration. 1) The pleadings should only be struck pursuant to Rule 173 in cases where it is obvious that the claim or defence is devoid of all merit or cannot possibly succeed. It follows that where an abuse of process has taken place, the intervention of the court by the stay or even dismissal of proceedings, which may often be required by the very essence of justice to be done, it merits consideration here because Chicoine J. specifically addressed the criteria applicable to an application to strike pursuant to rule 173(e) as distinct from Rule 173(a). 2) National filed statements of defence alleging an agreement amongst the secured creditors and the owners, which representations National has acted upon to its detriment, the FCC action is barred during the respective three-year periods of barn use restriction by the doctrine of equitable estoppel. 3) The present FCC claims for foreclosure should be dismissed or the court should declare that FCC is estopped from foreclosing or taking possession of secured property until the expiration of the respective 3-year HTP periods."

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) Section of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, concerns the need to obtain leave for 'interlocutory appeals' and is not relevant to the resolution of the issues in this application. 2) Section 7(2)(a) is subject to s. 7(3) of The Psychologist Act and its predecessors, dating back to The Interpretation Act, and is silent on the question, providing as it does for right of appeal by the member to the court that the enactment confers a limited right of appeals.  3) The psychologists Act is not a silent expression of legislative intent establishing the general rule that an appeal lies to the Court from a Queen”s Bench decision. 4) The Psychology Act is a clear expression of the general intent of the legislature that it created the general jurisdiction of the court when subject to no legislative limit: to provide parties to proceedings in the Court with the most comprehensive and effective means of redress possible in relation to such failures. 5) There is no distinction between professional and judicial statutes and others. 6) The psychologist Act provides that the Court does not have right to appealed from the decision of council to Queen‘s Bench, but that does not limit the member’ s.7(2) to this one. For these reasons, the legislature amended The Registered Nurses Act in The Registered Nursinges Amendment Act, 1993, SS 1993, 37, 4, by granting specific right to the discipline body and to the nurses to appeal from the court of Queen's Bench unless an enactment “confers only limited right” (SS 1959, 12). The question of costs is left for the panel of Court hearing the appeal."
4_2005skca61.txt,The applicants apply for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 33.2(2) of The Municipal Board Act to appeal to this Court against the decision of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board Assessment Appeals Committee. HELD: Leave is granted to appeal.,"The applicants will have leave pursuant to s. 33.2(2) of The Municipal Board Act to appeal against the decision of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board Assessment Appeals Committee rendered in this matter on the questions of law arising out of the following grounds of appeal. The Committee erred by mischaracterizing, misreading or ignoring the decision in Harvard Developments Ltd. et al v. The City of Regina et al, 2004 SKCA 103 (CanLII) (the “HDL Decision”), which confirmed the Board of Revision in appeal 98-520 that the Wascana Energy Building sale could not be used for MAF purposes, when the Committee decided to overturn the Board’s decision to exclude the said sale from the sales array. HELD: Leave granted. Costs in the cause were to be paid in the amount of $2,000."
2006skqb536.txt,"The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf. The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at an unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services, a newly formed division of Ritchie Bros. The plaintiff was purportedly retiring from farming and the transaction was in the closing stages at the time the plaintiff was first approached to become a potential customer. In this transitional period, the contractual negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendants generated two standard form agreements, preliminary 'LeBlanc' contract dated December 23, 2003 and subsequent 'Ritchie Bros.' contract dated March 28, 2004. HELD: 1) While a number of issues require exploration in the present case, the preeminent question is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auctions, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on his behalf, or for its own benefit. 2) The issues in this case have much to do with the unique nature of 'unreserved auctions', where goods are sold to the highest bidder, and the owner is precluded from affecting sale prices either by the use of reserve bids or through involvement, directly or indirectly in the bidding process. An open and level playing field is critical to the integrity of a clean auction. There are no owner buybacks, no artificial or manipulated values, no reserves, and no minimums, and in case where an owner is caught in direct attempt to buy back his property or move to a new location, the breach is obvious and the response is swift. An announcement is made to the crowd that the plaintiff had actually been paid in full, in that Ritchie's had included the full sale price of the combine when it calculated the gross proceeds of sale, less 14% commission under clause 4.05. The taking amounted to trespass and conversion. 3) In the first flush of togetherness, the defendants were keen to hold an auction in the Melfort area and engage the competition head to head. They wanted to establish themselves as a presence in a regional market previously dominated by Hodgins Auctioneers Inc. (Hodgins). The defendants declared its guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the Contract to Auction (C&A). The formal transaction was not effectively concluded until January 2004. It was apparently a share acquisition, such that the defendant could not possibly match the plaintiff's purchase price. 4) The plaintiff, who had rented out the majority of his lands the year prior, had arranged for Hodgins to come and inspect his equipment"
7_1997canlii11172.txt,"An application pursuant to s232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for a determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada had sought disclosure. The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors. The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions. The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm. At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties. HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld. 2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction. One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.  3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor. Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency. 7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery. They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants. 8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice. Notes prepared by the accountant and the interoffice communications summarizing discussions with the solicitor also fell within the scope of privilege.","This was an application pursuant to s. 232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for the determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which RevenueCanada has sought disclosure. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondents were clearly acting as agents of the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice from the applicant. 2)The respondent was acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of the applicant applicants and on the instructions of applicants. 3)The extent to which solicitor privilege can be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by the applicants accountants was at issue.  4)There was a common ground between the parties in this case that no communication, statement or other material made or prepared by an accountant falls within the solicitor and client privilege unless it was prepared by one of the appellant's accountants (which did not directly involve the applicants themselves) as part of the process to obtain legal advice."
4_2016skqb160.txt,"Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat. The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence. The accused was found guilty as charged.","The accused was charged with assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused left the area, went to the rear of the building and in close quarters, as the accused himself testified, threw a kitchen knife at the complainant. The complainant was injured in the confrontation and the accused ran towards his vehicle, where the complainant confronted him and slashed his tire on the complainant's car. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1) The nature of the force or threat that was presented by the size of the complainant and the words used by the accused were not of a nature that would warrant, as reasonable, the action subsequently taken by the complainant against the accused. 2) The Crown had established that the offence charged occurred on the date and at the location alleged in the indictment and that the butcher knife entered as Exhibit P1 was clearly a weapon as defined by s. 2 of the Code.  3) The accused's actions were not reasonable in the circumstances and did not constitute lawful protection of himself from any use or threatened use of force against him by the defendant. The evidence showed that the complainant initiated the confrontation by his approach to and very close contact with the accused, who was in his personal space. While the accused's reaction and his statement was regrettably crude, disrespectful and insensitive to the complainant, nevertheless the fact that he did not further assail the complainant nor touch him could only lead to the reasonable conclusion that the accused considered the matter over and he had no intention to use any force against the defendant, nor was its use imminent within the meaning of s.267(a)."

1998canlii13596.txt,"Administrative Law - Judicial Review - Bias/Institutional BiasAdministrative Law - Medical Care Insurance - Medical Fees - Repayment - AppealProfessions and Occupations - Physicians and Surgeons - Cardiologist - Medical Fees_____ A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB). Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue. There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented. 3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence. The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data. The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects. He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours. 4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76. The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.  5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary.","The cardiologist appeals an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee that he repay $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch. HELD: The appeal is brought under s. 49.21(1) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care insurance Act. The Committee made the following errors: 1) improperly placing the burden of proof on the cardiologist; 2) the Committee refused to advise the appellant of such evidence. 3) The Committee did not provide adequate reasons for its decision; 4) it did not take into account the role of the Director of Professional Review in the hearing conducted by the Committee; 5) institutional bias raised by the roles of the director and the Committee assigned to them were not reasonably supported by the evidence before it.

5_2006nssc353.txt,"The claimant flooring dealer had supplied and installed a large amount of flooring in the defendant's new home. Although the defendant had visited the claimant's store and selected the flooring, the actual purchase was made by the defendant's contractor who did not pay the claimant and had now declared bankruptcy. The adjudicator found that although the three criteria for an unjust enrichment claim had been met, there was no special relationship between the parties and thus, denied the claim. The claimant appealed. Appeal allowed; the absence of a special relationship will not automatically defeat a claim of unjust enrichment; the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment claims.","This is an appeal from a decision by an adjudicator of the Small Claims Court. The Adjudicator did not find that the Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment. The presence of a special relationship will not necessarily defeat a claim. HELD: The Court allowed the appeal. 1)The facts established that there was a 'casual arrangement' as contemplated by Justice Muldoon in McLaren, however, there had not been a contract between the defendants. 2)There was no special relationship between the parties, frequently contractual at the outset, which relationship would have made it unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit conferred on him by the plaintiff benefit, be it that it was not conferred 'officiously' or an unenforceable contract. There was a nexus between the defendant's and the plaintiff's labour force. 3)In almost all of the cases, cited here by counsel in which the plaintiffs have succeeded, there was no unjust enrichment because there did not exist special relationship. The Court of Appeal offered little guidance and appeared to come perilously close to suggesting that, in the absence of such a relationship, coupled with either request for or acquiescence in the receipt of the benefit, no recovery will be allowed."
8_2005skca120.txt,"The deceased made a Will appointing her only son, the appellant, as executor. In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents. The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly. She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000. After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself. He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will. The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him. He appeals against that judgment. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.  1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2) The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust. The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren. She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact. Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate. In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust. In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis. Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate. 3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error.  4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren. The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased. The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him. The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee. The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence","The appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the will but were given to him for the benefit of his sisters.

2_2007nssc235.txt,"The parties, divorced, had children, aged 23, 19, and 14 years, respectively. The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support. The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment. The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed. Both parties applied to vary child support. The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school. Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses. The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies. The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months.

The parties each brought a series of variation applications under the Act. Those applications relate primarily (though not exclusively) to the issues of spousal support, child support and access. The Corollary Relief Judgment provided that the parties would pay child support in the amount of $3,100 per month until the wife graduated from the M.B.A. program. The requirement for the father to pay the children's educational expenses is conditional upon the educational institution complying with U.N. policy. Any reimbursement due from the father's employer as result of the payment of William's education expenses would be retained by the father.

Based on the wording of the Act and the context of the relevant provisions, the Board's interpretation that the Act granted the Board discretion to refuse reimbursement for medical marijuana was reasonable. It was not necessary to decide whether Policy Statement 5 was ultra vires. 1)The Board's decision to decline reimbursement on the basis that medical marijuana is not proven and therefore not 'necessary or required' is reasonable but this is not the case here. The Board did not rely on policy statement 5 or even mention it in reaching its decision. Even if it did, it did not decide this matter. 2)There is no evidence that the Board made its decision based on considerations such as the potential political consequences of paying for medical marihuana. On the face of its reasons the Board denied reimbursement specifically because medical marijuana could not be found to be necessary or required. The studies did not definitively state that medical cannabis was effective. Many studies noted side effects and most recommended further research before drawing a definitive conclusion on the use of the drug."
e_2009skpc9.txt,"The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants. The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions.","The Plaintiffs claim $6,700.77 for water damage sustained while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin, Saskatchewan in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the Defendant. HELD: 1) Whether the Plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the Defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect.  2) Quantum of damages and mitigation. The Court infers from Mr. Verklan's report that the apparent defect in the inability of the door to sit flat would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned and remedied. 3) Perfection however could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and therefore, some seepage may be expected even after the door had been cleaned. Nonetheless, this existing sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. This may well have applied to the door seal once cleaned, remedied, or before being cleaned.  4) Appeal of damages. The Plaintiffs acknowledge that the U Haul truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to its being unloaded. This undoubtedly exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The court also questions the quantum of damages sustained and puts mitigation of damages in issue.  5) Appeal for cause.  6) Appeal to the Court of Appeal for the amount of damages awarded totalling $250,000.  7) Quantum in damages.  8) Apportionment of damages to the plaintiffs' possessions.  9) The Court is of the view that the plaintiffs are pre-cluded from recovering against the defendant by virtue a contractual term that acknowledges the equipment is water resistant and not waterproof.  10) The court infers the term of the rental contract which stated '... understand that the equipment rented is water-resistant and not water proof'.  10 ) The Court also infers that the Court is also of the opinion that the term acknowledging that the unit was water resistant does not constitute part of the contract.  11) Quantum damages.

He was given credit for 22 months spent in custody. Matychuk was sentenced to 12 years in prison but was given credit for time in custody on a 1:1 basis because the Court had not found any circumstances to justify any greater amount of credit. Matychuk’s credit was for 19 months. The sentences were based on the circumstances of the offence: a home invasion and inflicting serious bodily harm on a young victim. The assault was violent and degrading and took place over a period of time. Weapons were used while the victim was bound and sexually assaulted and threatened.,"HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of breaking into the complainant’s home and committing the indictable offence of aggravated sexual assault. The Court sentenced the accused to 40 months concurrent on each count. The accused had a lengthy criminal record dating back to 1992 when he was youth. Most of his convictions relate to thefts and break and enters to commit theft. He also had numerous convictions for obstruction of police officer, fail to attend court and fail to comply with recognizance and court orders. The court found that the accused was an addict and an alcoholic."

In so doing, it asked that its solicitor, Mr. Hesje, be appointed as selling officer to conduct the sale and report to the Court. The court expressed its concern to Mr. Hesje during the course of his submissions as to the propriety of the applicant solicitor serving in such a dual function. He informed the court that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined. In the court's respectful view, it is not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor. There are obvious difficulties with conflict of interest. Who does the selling officer serve: the Court, from which his or her authority originates; or the client? The matter is of sufficient importance that the court concluded it should reduce its thoughts to a fiat and direct that it be distributed to other members of the Court. To be fair, Mr. Hesje indicated he was perfectly willing to have another member of the Law Society unconnected to the proceedings appointed as selling officer.

e_2016skpc157.txt,"HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice. The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately. The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving. The accused was arrested at 5:36 a.m. and the police officer did not leave the scene until some 36 minutes later. The delay was not satisfactory and the delay may have prejudiced the accused. HELD: The breath tests were to be taken as soon as practicable. 1) The reasonable suspicion standard is very low and having regard to the evidence, and the existing law, that threshold has been met. The difficulty in the instant case is that, as the Crown has pointed out, defence did not mention the s. 8 violation in its Charter notice. As such, defence should not be allowed to argue it at the conclusion of the trial.  2) The need to take the tests as quickly as practicable is to ensure that the accused's blood alcohol content was as accurate as possible at the time of driving. This is particularly important when the readings are slightly above the legal limit.  3) The accused had to be booked, she wished to use the washroom, she spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel, and it was necessary to comply with the breathalyzer room.  4) There were two time periods that have to be considered the period from arrest to departure to the police station, the time from arrival at the scene to the taking of the second sample, 77 minutes.  5) The delay in departing the scene is not satisfactory. The delays, if any, are satisfactorily explained. 2) There was no compelling reason, or need, to wait for the tow truck or trucks to arrive. The Court of Queen's Bench in Beaton relied on the Court of Appeal's decision in Carter (para 9). If defence maintains that Constable Erickson lacked the reasonable suspicion to make the ASD demand that would result in s. Charter breach, it is necessary to state this in the Charter notice as well."
d_2004nssf15.txt,"The parties were married for 10 years. Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home. Also at issue was the husband's obligation to provide the wife with an automobile pursuant to the separation agreement. Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile. The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year. Although the wife did not establish any disadvantage from the marriage, there were disadvantages relating to its breakdown and her lifestyle deteriorated as result of the marriage ending.","The issues were: 1) Spousal support; 2) Ms. Bemister's allegation that the husband failed to comply with the Separation Agreement requiring him to provide her with an automobile. HELD: The order was granted on the grounds that there has been a breakdown of the marriage and the spouses have lived separate and apart for more than a year. There were disadvantages related to the husband's failure to pay her $1,000 per month for an indefinite period. The Court concluded that the wife was entitled to spousal assistance at separation and that such entitlement continues. Her financial needs and needs require such support. The court did not find the evidence supports a conclusion it was agreed to be only for one year. The wife's financial situation clearly demonstrated her need for such support to continue."

The defendants objected to the finalization of the judgment on the ground that, pursuant to Court of Appeal Rule 15, the notice of appeal had stayed the execution of the judgment until the disposition of the appeal. The plaintiff submitted that the calculation of the judgment was not acting on it. HELD: The defendant misconstrued the scope of Rule 15 as it does not stay proceedings.

The parties were in a common law relationship and had two children, aged 9 and 12. After separation, the children resided with their mother, the respondent, in La Ronge and they had access with the petitioner on the weekends. In January 2011, the parties agreed to a weekly co-parenting arrangement. In April 2013 the petitioner was advised by the respondent that she and the children had moved to Melville. Up until that point the child had always resided in the La Ronge area and attended only one school. HELD: The Court found the co-parenting arrangement to be the de facto parenting arrangement and that there was no risk to the children with either parent. The Court ordered that the parties were joint custodians of the children and that preservation of the status quo was in their best interests. The Court ordered that the children primarily reside in La Ronge with the petitioner and attend school there. The Court also ordered specified access for the respondent.","FIAT: Further to the hearing of this matter, the issue is whether the children are to be relocated from La Ronge to Melville, Saskatchewan.

There are two children of the relationship, namely: Justin Morgan McKerracher born May 31, 2001 and Sean Lucas McKerracher born September 26, 2004. HELD: The Court found on the evidence that the parties were to be joint custodial parents for the two boys. The preservation of the status quo is in the best interests of the boys. Therefore, the boys are to reside in the petitioner's home or Air Ronge, Saskatchewan and attend school there while residing with the petitioner.

The specific grounds relied on by the father are as follows: The mother deliberately denied access and intentionally refused to comply with the access provisions contained in paragraph 4(d) of the Access Order granted on September 1, 2001. The mother has avoided going to the door when the child is exchanged. 2) There is a serious inadequacy in the fundamentals of good parenting.

d_2017skqb42.txt,"HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages.","HELD: The Court found that the defendants, acting alone or in concert, published defamatory comments about the plaintiff in series of articles in the StarPhoenix newspaper and on websites owned and operated by the newspaper and Canwest Publishing Inc. The plaintiff suffered loss and damage to his professional and civic reputation. The defendants did not publish any retraction or apology nor did they remove the alleged offensive articles. The court ordered the defendants to submit further written submissions on the plaintiff’s request for an injunction requiring them to remove certain articles from websites under their control if the plaintiff was found not negligent and finally exonerated. There was no explanation for the delay in seeking this amendment."
e_2014skqb344.txt,"The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi. It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price. Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000. If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs. Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff. Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application. All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful.","The plaintiff applied for an order nisi for judicial sale of the property owned by the defendants. The Limitation of Civil Rights Act does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not a purchase-money mortgage. However, a judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency in the judgment set by the court. Otherwise, as provided by s. of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt. The proposed selling officer ought not to be the plaintiff's own counsel."

8_2014skqb299.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness. Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly. Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public. The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past. The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout. To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn. The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable.","HELD: The court found that the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction, made an unreasonable decision, or committed an otherwise reviewable error by misinterpreting sections of the University of Saskatchewan Act and in particular s. 51. 2. The standard of review was that the president's personal recommendation was not required, the Board was not obliged to follow the president’s recommendation before considering an application for tenure submitted by one of the committees assigned the power to recommend pursuant to the Agreement. The arbitrator concluded that an award of tenure is neither an appointment nor promotion as contemplated by the Act, but rather an appointment and a promotion within the meaning of the Act."
9_2005skca89.txt,"This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act. The couple had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property. The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents. The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced. By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000. 2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property. There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act. On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property. The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage. Minority: 1) The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act. The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together. In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2) The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents. He made a finding the loans were statute-barred. The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent. He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid. He simply used less than precise language.","This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, s.S.1997, c.F-6.3, initiated by a nurse against a doctor. The two had lived together for several years. She sought a judgment distributing their property or its value equally between them. The trial judge held that the respondent had acquired the house prior to the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the wife was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gift or the loans. With that, the appellant appealed. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The trial judge erred in concluding that the value of the house was exempt from distribution because he had acquired it prior to commencing the relationship between the parties. Alternatively, he contended the gift and loans served to reduce the value available for distribution.  2)The Court considered the equivalent of this section in Mitchell v. Mitchell (1992), 1992 CanLII 8234 (SK CA), and Vilcu v. Grams (1999), 172 Sask.R. 201(Sask.C.A.). The Court considered that Mitchell was an equivalent to this section. It was not the same in that Mitchell had been statute barred. The Court held that it was far from clear the respondent will ever be required to repay them. 3)The respondent's position regarding the loans he obtained from his parents to enable him purchase the Vancouver property and the mortgages in favour of his parents came to rest on these provisions of s.21 and 23 of the Act.  4)The evidence showed that the trial judge did not err in finding that the parties had become'spouses within the meaning of the act in late June 1994 and then in holding that Ms. Ruskin was entitled in equal proportion to its value without any reduction to the gifts or loans. 5)The court considered that the issue of distribution in whole or in part was governed by s.22 rather than s. 21 and 23. The matter was governed not by the Act but by section 23."

The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child.

This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry with the child to be completely returned to the mother within 30 days of this order.

1993canlii3174.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards. The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children. Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home. The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal. The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final. Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order, that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected. There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision. The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases. To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties. Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period. The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","This was an appeal from a decision of Hall, L.J.S.C. reducing the appellant's support from $2,000 to $1200 per month. HELD: The appeal was allowed without costs. The decision did not deprive the courts of ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support. Where the parties have negotiated their own agreement, freely and on the advice of independent legal counsel, as to how their financial affairs should be settled on the breakdown of their marriage, and the agreement is not unconscionable in the substantive law sense, it should be respected. The basic principle in Pelech is that. settlement agreements must be respected and there is an element of unforeseeability by the parties as of the time the consensual arrangement is arrived at. This is not the type of radical change that would trigger the Court's jurisdiction in reviewing the decree nisi."
c_2016skqb293.txt,"HELD: The appeal was granted on the basis of the first two grounds as well as others. The court quashed the tribunal’s decision and reinstated the appellant’s hospital privileges. The court reviewed the transcript of the tribunal’s hearing and its written decision. With regard to the first two issues, it found that the tribunal had erred in law in the following ways: 1) by failing to conduct a de novo hearing as required. It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision. It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent. It merely accepted the evidence of the SMO’s experts.","HELD: The appeal was granted. The decision of the Practitioner Staff Appeals Tribunal (Tribunal) was reviewed and reinstated on an interim basis. There were numerous errors made by the Tribunal. The Tribunal did err in some respects and that the errors lead to the granting of a remedy to the appellant. The appellant brought this appeal by way of written notice of appeal dated January 21, 2016. The evidence disclosed to the Tribunal was that all options were reviewed with CC, who elected to pursue a particular course of treatment. This was done appropriately, requiring remedial steps to safeguard the mother's welfare. The holding of critical incident review does not connote any wrongful act or omission on the part of any members of the patient care team. Rather, it is part of the process by which health authorities evaluate their delivery of care to determine if adequate standards are being met, how things could be improved, and what steps should be taken to protect the mother."
2_2007skqb378.txt,"The outstanding issue is child support, past and future. The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent is a farmer. His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made. The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment. However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose. It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income. In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support. The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%. An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added. The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528. As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe. This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused. The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally. It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now. 3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support. The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable. 3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access. She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.  4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","The issue was the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent was ordered to pay one-half of the $4,237.16 he claimed for child support, past and future.  2) The petitioner knew this and when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally and on her own initiative. It would be inappropriate to now compel the respondent to contribute when he expressed a contrary position.  3) The Court reviewed the circumstances and found that the fees were ordinary, and not extraordinary expenses and would be encompassed in the basic child support. It was appropriate that his income be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005, which was $41,834.50. 4) There were certain health costs and they were extraordinary and to be shared by the parties. 5) There was a material change in the petitioner's income over the years. She claimed for full day's wages. This ignores the fact that she would have been away from her employment for half the time in any event. Her actual loss would be less. An appropriate retroactive variation should be effected.  6) The court reviewed the respondent’s personal and professional expenses and concluded that it would be fair if the contributions were equal, taking into account that the incomes were comparable."
c_2014skqb144.txt,The Court dismissed the application. It found that the accused was not capable of representing himself but that the accused had not shown that he was indigent.,"HELD: The application for court appointed counsel was dismissed. The court found that the accused was not capable of conducting his own defence in light of the personal issues which he was facing and his methamphetamine addiction. The Court also found that in circumstances where an accused's fair trial interests are impaired for want of legal representation, that an appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings under s.24(1) of the Charter in the event the prosecution insists on proceeding with trial in breach of the accused's Charter right to fair trial. The subtle but critical issue of the difference between possession of substance for the purposes of a trial and possession of a weapon is raised."

At the end of the review they were to provide a written report to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer. The hospital staff participating in the investigation and review were advised that their information would be treated as part of a 'peer review' and therefore confidential. Upon receipt of the report the hospital, as a result, refused to disclose the report to the families. An application pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was made by an M.L.A., who sought for the disclosure of the report and for a review of the hospital's decision to not release the report. The hospital decided to release the full report. The appellant employees appealed the decision of the hospital, claiming that they had been assured confidentiality. Allowing the appeal, that the disclosure of personal information consisting of personal recommendations or evaluations, character references, or personal evaluations by the appellants and other hospital staff are presumed under s. 20(3)(g) of the Act to be an unreasonable invasion of a third party's personal privacy. Under s. 20(1) the hospital is required to refuse to disclose this information. It necessarily follows that recommendations in the report founded upon such information is also presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy and is likewise not to be disclosed.

Dismissing the appeal, that the report would be used as an internal document only, thus ensuring the confidentiality of the appellants' participation in the process.

8_2017skqb53.txt,"The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography. The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused. The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant. The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone. The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2). The application proceeded by voir dire. The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history.",The accused applied for relief pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence seized through the execution of a search warrant. The accused called no evidence. He disputed the facial validity of the search warrant and also argued his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated. HELD: The application proceeded by way of voir dire. The determination of whether any evidence seized should be excluded was dependent on the decision on the above captioned issues. 1) There was no evidence at the amplification hearing to establish the recency of the tip because that information was known to the police at the time it was obtained and subject to the requirement that unconstitutionally obtained evidence cannot be considered.  2) The evidence seized was not disclosed at the hearing. It is apparently located on either the accused's laptop computer or his cell phone.  3) The application was to allow the Crown to supplement the record with testimony of that which was in the minds of the police and assist in proving the elements of the offence.

It was held in an earlier fiat in June that the addition of the two proposed plaintiffs asserted new causes of action and amendments to the statement of claim could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act. The defendant resisted the joinder of the new plaintiffs and amendments on the basis of undue delay and actual prejudice. The statement of claim alleged nuisance, and in the alternative, negligence against the City with respect to the design, construction and maintenance of the sewer system causing his basement to flood. The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time. Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied. The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes. HELD: The amendments were allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The facts were uncertain. It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced. If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period. 2)Inexcusable delay was not established. 3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice. If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction. No evidence had been lost. The basement was available for inspection. It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants. 4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments. The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice. It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff.

The fact that she was not appears to have arisen from inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice made at that time.

e_1996canlii6831.txt,"The petitioner sought a divorce, custody, spousal and child support and an unequal division of matrimonial property. The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order. Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children. Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job. It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support. 2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence. She suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown. 3)The car owned by the petitioner when she married was exempt property. The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value. The list prepared by the respondent was used to divide household goods, tools and equipment. 4)The respondent was to assume one-half of the bank loan and it was agreed that the pension funds should be shared equally. 5)It would be unfair and inequitable to the custodial parent to order an equal division of the matrimonial property.

e_2016skpc106.txt,"HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. She enlisted the assistance of the Moose Jaw Police Service so that she could enter the accused's home to investigate whether the children were in need of protection and if necessary to apprehend those children. The accused kicked and hit the complainant. The complainant testified that she went to the residence hoping to arrest the accused, not apprehend the children. She was specifically asked whether she had a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act allowing her to enter the home. She said she had no such warrant, and had never utilized a warrant before. HELD: The Court concluded that the accused did not have any lawful authority to enter Ms. Bigsky's apartment suite to apprehend the accused. He was not exercising criminal law power and his entrance to that suite will be contrary to her section rights, unless that entrance and search is determined to be lawful under some other legal authority."
e_2009nssm47.txt,"The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property. The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend. As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial.","HELD: The claim was dismissed. The Court found that there was a degree of blameworthiness which caused liability to attach. The defendant was clearly part of a joint enterprise to remove a few damaged trees from his property, which was fully lawful enterprise. There was no reasonable foreseeability that the defendant would stray so far from the area discussed that a neighbour's property might be breached. The plaintiff was awarded damages against the defendant for the actions of the defendant. 1)The Court did not consider the Counterclaim to have been established and dismissed the claim. 2)There was no evidence that this was an honest though careless mistake on the defendant's part. It would not matter whether he supplied the chainsaw or the gas. He could not have foreseen that Mr. Renouf would do what he did and should not incur any legal responsibility. If there was liability on either or both of the defendants, the Court was obliged to arrive at a figure that is more reasonable. 3)The claim against the Defendant was dismissed in the amount of $1,234.90 in addition to the damages of $5,750."

The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced. HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions. The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post. There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled. The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty. 2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3). It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands. The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed. logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog.

The court found that the dog was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed, that it ran from its yard and attacked the lady attending a garage sale. The court imposed a fine of $200. HELD: The accused did not take reasonable steps to prevent the offence from occurring. There were seven specific pieces of evidence that supported the Crown's conclusion. 1)There was clear evidence that on the occasion when Mrs. Barks was in her back alley, the dog escaped through the garbage can enclosure. 2)The evidence was not discredited on cross-examination as to what she observed or what she felt. 3)The court found there was no reasonable step taken to prevent a small person, a small child, or the dog from getting free itself. 4)The accused had not taken reasonable steps. There was no evidence that he went through the house where the dog ran. 5)The Court was of the view that the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence has been committed, and if the Crown proves on that basis that it has, then it's open to the accused to establish on balance of probabilities that he took such reasonable steps as were necessary to prevent an attack. The appropriate fine in the circumstances is $200 for the offence."

The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice. He denied being in contact with his mother. He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries. New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal. Appeal dismissed. The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny. Here the respondent's claim was valid. The adjudicator had the jurisdiction/authority to make an order for substituted service and the respondent followed it. At the very least, the appellant was notified of the hearing dates by text message(s). While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set.

The singular ground of appeal cited in the respondent's Notice is a failure to follow the requirements of natural justice. The respondent mistakenly showed up for the hearing on the wrong date, which was one day after the actual hearing. While waiting around for half an hour, he checked the doors of the Court House several times, then assumed that Court was cancelled because of bad weather. He was mistaken as to what would be the outcome of his absence. His conscience choice to ignore the hearing notification resulted in the judgment against him. Personal service was effected upon him by the Order for Substituted Service granted by the Small Claims Court and the Court did what it was authorized to do by statute and Regulations. Service having been properly effected on the Respondent, the Court is not prepared to interfere with this finding. The Court has sympathy for the appellant and for the reason he did not attend the hearing. This is not a reasonable excuse as found in Kemp, supra nor one that the Court had sympathy for. The Appellant was not mistaken about the date of the hearing nor was he mistaken as what would happen in the absence of his wife. The hearing was held on the 20th day of April 2010. The adjudicator was satisfied that the requirements for substituted service had been met and the matter proceeded. The Respondent proved her claim and made that finding as well. The appellant did not ignore the notice of the Hearing. He chose to ignore it and make no further inquiries. Natural justice in this case demands that he be heard."
e_2012nssc101.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15. The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of four counts of sexual assault. The Court held that the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty. The court also held that there were other mitigating factors to consider, such as whether the accused intended the victim receive a communication as an invitation, incitement or counseling to do the physical conduct, or by present state of mind that an accused knew the substantial and unjustified risk that the victim would receive."
d_2008nsca10.txt,"The appellant appealed the adoption order regarding her natural child. Although at one time the child had been in the permanent care of the Agency, that order was terminated and replaced by a private guardianship order which had placed the child with the now-adoptive parents. Although neither of the birth parents, who resided in British Columbia, had attended the adoption hearing, the birth mother now sought access to the child and requested that the court receive fresh evidence as to her unsuccessful efforts to obtain counsel to represent her at the adoption hearing. Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence. The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. Allowing the appeal would be in the child's best interests as she had resided with the adoptive parents for the past three years and would continue to do so pending the further hearing.","The appellant was the birth mother of a child who was in need of protective services. A temporary guardianship order was issued in Alberta. The child was returned to her birth parents but again apprehended by the child welfare authorities. In 2005 an order for permanent guardianship was granted. The respondent parents temporarily re-located to Calgary and put themselves forward as potential adoptive parents. On May 1, 2006 the respondent parents, who now reside in British Columbia, were each personally served with notice of the Adoption Hearing scheduled to take place. Neither appeared at the hearing. The appellant appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The due diligence requirement is not applicable here. 2) The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or be represented and that she made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. 3) The Court was entitled to dispense with the birth parents' consent if she did not appear at the adoption hearing. 4) The court was not precluded from raising, before the application court, the issue of whether the appellant's consent to the adoption was required by s.78(6) of the Act. 5) It would be procedurally just to set aside the order and permit the appellant to be heard."
6_2007skqb111.txt,"FIAT: A caveat registered to the applicant was removed as a result of the notice to lapse procedure. The caveat purported to be based upon a right to receive royalties from all gas, carbon and oil produced from the land. The applicant denied having ever received the notice to lapse. The applicant sought: 1) retroactive reinstatement of the caveat by order of the Court; and 2) an inquiry by the Court as to whether or not the caveat was removed improperly. The respondent companies that acquired an interest in the subject land subsequent to the caveat being removed opposed the application based, among other things, on the principle of indefeasibility of title, as did the Registrar of Land Titles. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1) Even if the caveat was removed improperly, the Court ought not to retroactively reinstate it, because to do so would defeat the fundamental principle of indefeasibility of title that has been continued in The Land Titles Act, 2000; and 2) it would not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief. The process, if the applicants chose to pursue it, would be an action under Part XII of the Act.","The companies that acquired an interest in the South West Quarter of Section Twenty-seven (27), in Range Four (4) in the Province of Saskatchewan, in the Dominion of Canada applied for declaration that the caveat was wrongfully removed by the Registrar of Land Titles and that it be reinstated retroactively to the date of its removal. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It would simply not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief. The process, if the applicants choose to pursue it, would be an action under Part XII of The Land Title Act, 2000. Alternatively, the Court ought to declare that the caveats were wrongfully installed, a necessary first step in accessing the assurance funds. 2)The respondents were entitled to costs of defending the application. 3)The Registrar had two feasible options in relation to how to address lapse procedures commenced under the old system but not completed as of the date the title was issued. The first was to continue the process begun under the original system and automatically record the lapsing of the caveat upon the expiry of the 30 days from the mailing of the notice to lapse procedure. The second was to proceed retroactively."
d_2005skqb454.txt,"The plaintiff sues the defendants for $50,000 plus interest. The claim is based on the allegation that the plaintiff loaned the defendant Kelly $69,000. The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan. However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made. In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly. The only discussion she seems to have had was with her husband after which she wrote a cheque to the defendant.","The plaintiff loaned some $69,000 to the defendant on or about the 30th day of January 2001. The claim goes on to say that the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month, that some payments were made, but in the end, an amount of approximately $61,000 was still outstanding. The defendants deny that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants and argue that in fact it was an investment by the plaintiff and her husband into the auto broking business. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1)The only evidence that might suggest that a transaction was made by the defendant Kelly Eiswerth was that some of the payments made by her to the plaintiff were in excess of $ 1,500, the plaintiff felt she received a profit from the first transaction and chose to pay for another vehicle instead of deducting that amount from what was owed. There is also evidence that the plaintiff benefitted the husband by repurchasing equipment that the husband had lost to the trustee in bankruptcy and gifting it back to the husband. There was no written contracts or other written evidence of any agreement between the plaintiff, the defendant, and/or the numbered company defendant evidencing the nature of the transaction. 2)There was no evidence that any of the defendant's materials were produced on the basis of cross-examination. The defendant's affidavit was not filed with the court. 3)The defendant's affidavits were not filed on the same day as the plaintiff's statement of claim. The affidavits did not appear to have been filed on a monthly basis."
9_2003skqb481.txt,The United States of America sought to extradite the respondent to face a charge of conspiracy to import into the USA a substance containing cocaine. The USA brought a motion to set a date for the extradition hearing. The respondent brought a motion requesting further disclosure and alleged that the USA had not disclosed all of the evidence in its custody or control. HELD: The application for disclosure was dismissed. A date for the extradition hearing was set.,"The United States sought to extradite the Jamaican national to face a charge of conspiracy to import cocaine. The Jamaican entered Canada in May 2003 and is entitled to remain in Canada as permanent resident for the time being. He has a permanent resident card which expires May 5, 2008. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)It is alleged that the Attorney General has not disclosed all the evidence in his custody or control. Counsel for the Minister of Justice however has undertaken that everything within the control of the AG General has been turned over to the solicitor for Griffiths except only the diplomatic note from USA to Canada which initiated the process. There has been no investigation in Canada of the alleged offence. He is not entitled, at the extradition stage, to present his defence on the assumption that fair hearing will not take place at the trial or in order to avoid trial in the foreign state. 2)The motion on Griffiths's behalf is without merit and it is dismissed. The motion on behalf of the Deputy Attorney General to set a date for the extradition hearing was without merit. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was also dismissed. 3)The role of the hearing judge is modest one; absent express statutory or treaty authorization, the sole purpose of an extradition hearing is to ensure that the evidence establishes a prima facie case that the act alleged would constitute a crime in Canada. It is not the business of the extradition judge to assume responsibility for reviewing the actions of foreign officials in preparing the evidence for an extradition proceeding. This would seem to be in breach of the most elementary dictates of comity between sovereign states. 4)It follows that the extent of Griffiths' right to disclosure of documents and information is limited to those issues specific to the functions of this Court. The application on his behalf is to stay proceedings on one or more of the following grounds: contempt of court by the AG for failing to provide proper disclosure; alternatively, the production by the Attorney general of witness statements and other evidence in compliance with the common law duty of procedural fairness as it applies in administrative proceedings; in the alternative, production of witness statement and other information pursuant to s. of the Charter."
c_2001skqb39.txt,"The defendants brought an application to compel responses to a large number of questions objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officer for SPMC, and sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The objections were categorized as the questions sought to elicit the plaintiff's manner of investigation or expert opinions; it should have been asked of another witness better suited to answer or third parties as the questions relate to issues between the defendant and the third parties; it was irrelevant or improper. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire. 3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage. 4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged. The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal. 5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation. Questions can be asked of the city. 6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege. 7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague. The plaintiff's claim was in excess of $7 million. A proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions and answers given or not given (Hill v. Arcola School Division). The defendants are not entitled to expert opinion. 8)Whether SPMC's insurer's investigation team participated related to manner of investigation and was therefore privileged. 9)The defendant will be able to examine the city in the third party claim with respect to documents from the fire department. 10)All discussions at mediation proceedings are strictly confidential. The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged. 11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.  12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position. They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date. Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it. There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question. The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement. 19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.  20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them. 21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed. It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer. The same question can be put if the first did not answer it. The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each. The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings. Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was. Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings. As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings. It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with. There were no exceptional circumstances.  24)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The defendants brought this application to compel responses to a large number of questions that were objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officers on behalf of Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (SPMC). They also sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. HELD: The question asked was 'what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire?' All discussions at the mediation proceedings are strictly confidential. Any questions arising out of anything disclosed during the mediation are clearly improper. The name of the plaintiffs' expert who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation is privileged. The plaintiffs were not required to answer the questions asked. Objection No. 8-P. 317, Line 15 to P. 318, Line 1) The question was too vague to answer. The respondents were entitled to disclosure of all facts that are or may be relevant to the determination of the facts in issue.

c_2012skqb426.txt,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code. The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed. The accused is 52 years old and in poor health. He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders. The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence. Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender is 52 years old and has a significant criminal record. The Court entered the conviction of the offender and prior to him being sentenced, he had accumulated several violence related convictions and concluded that his risk to re-offend violently in the future was mitigated only if he conscientiously applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his frustration and anger. HELD: 1) The Court had jurisdiction to entertain the dangerous offender application because it is both the court and is superior court of criminal jurisdiction. 2) It is an absolute necessity that the offender seriously addresses his apparent alcohol abuse problem and makes a commitment to sobriety for the remainder of his life. If he refuses to do so, his risk for committing acts of future violence is high. He appears to predate upon intimate partners for reasons which are not clear to me. However, there seems to be a pattern of offending in this way, which needs serious attention. This risk will largely be mitigated by conscientious application of his knowledge of the ways in which to vent his anger."
b_2010skqb187.txt,"The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits. The defendant failed to make any payment. The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale. The defendant was a developer. He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act. The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price. HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply. The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA. There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision. The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. Normal bidding rules shall apply. The plaintiff was entitled to costs.","HELD: The application was dismissed and the usual bidding rules applied. The plaintiff was granted a mortgage for $3,100,000 repayable by two installments of $300, then the balance payable on April 30, 2009. The defendant issued a statement of claim in October 2009 seeking foreclosure on the Land. None of the defendants entered defence but served demands for notice and then were noted for default of defence on March 12, 2010. By its notice of motion, the plaintiff seeks an order nisi for judicial sale pursuant to s. 11 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The court reviewed Christie v. Texas Industries (1985), 1985 CanLII 2631 and found that the Christie case remains the controlling authority, such that when applied to this case rejection of the submissions on the applicability and effect of ss. and 11 must follow. The Christie case had no application here as it was decided within the scope of the 1984-85-86 FLSA, and neither at that time nor since has there been any other similar legislation to the SFSA, nor was it intended that a developer, by leasing a parcel of land in the circumstances of this case, could gain the protection of the Farm Land Security Act; the defendant's focus and direction vis-à-vis the Land was the undertaking of a host of activities designed to develop the Land into an industrial park."
2_2005skqb513.txt,"FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003. They are married and the family home is in Connecticut. The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.  1) The child was born in Canada. He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003. In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit. It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child. In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner. Reconciliation was attempted. The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned. The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada. For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence. At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles. The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy. Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut. The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home. 2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody. The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate. Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut. This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.","FIAT: The parties are the parents of a child born in Canada. The respondent mother, an American citizen, continues to reside in Canada and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The children have been returned. 1) The Court is faced with the fact that change in primary caregiving might occur as result of a 'chasing order' issued in the former jurisdiction. Psychological harm to children may result by reason of the severance of that primary caregiver relationship. 2) More than a year has elapsed between the removal and the commencement of judicial proceedings and it can be demonstrated that the child is now settled into his new environment. 3) The respondent has demonstrated he has right to custody and therefore meets the obligation under Article 12 of the Convention. Once it has been determined that child has been wrongfully removed or retained the Hague Convention mandates the court to order the child's return forthwith. There is no suggestion that the exceptions under the Convention under Articles 12, 13 or 20 are applicable."

The Court of Appeal had ordered the Crown to produce an itemized inventory of the information in its possession to enable the Queen's Bench to review the information the Crown should disclose to the defence. This fiat concerned several documents. The Crown had already disclosed the contents of each of these documents and the only matter remaining in issue was the name of the lawyer who released the information. This arose as a result of the action of a Regina lawyer who had improperly revealed information from two of his divorce clients with respect to the charges against LaPorte et al. The Crown quite properly disclosed these statements which had been conveyed to the investigating officer.

3_2001nssc117.txt,"The plaintiffs were Sergeants in the Town of Bedford Police Department. Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank. The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement. After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights. The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed. Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court. It is irrelevant if the plaintiffs have now lost their rights to initiate the arbitration process.","HELD: The decision of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in Pleau v. Canada (1999), 181 N.S.R. (2d) 348, was informative as to the appropriate approach to be taken when there is a threshold question of whether there is an effective remedy. The issues were matters which fall within the exclusive dispute resolution process established under the Police Act. The plaintiff was bound by the provisions of the collective agreement pursuant to s. 41 of the TUA. The issue was whether this Court had jurisdiction to deal with the subject matter of Pleau. The court noted the recent decision in Nova Scotia Union of Public Employees v. Halifax Regional School Board, which incorporated the findings of the Interest Arbitration Award, including the classifications of Sergeant and Sergeant."
5_1991canlii4241.txt,"The applicant union sought an order of mandamus with certiorari in aid, ordering the defendant Minister to exercise his discretion to appoint an arbitrator to hear a grievance. The Minister had refused on the grounds the union was neither certified nor a party to a voluntary agreement. Granting the application, that the Minister had misdirected himself on a point of law. Quite apart from certification and voluntary recognition, the union could attain bargaining rights pursuant to Part II of the Trade Union Act, which allowed an employer in the construction industry to assign bargaining and negotiating rights to an 'accredited employers' association' such as the Construction Management Labour Bureau Ltd. The Court ordered the Minister to exercise his discretion under s.107(4) of the Act according to law as set out in Part II of the Act and confirmed by the Appeal Division in Boyd &amp; Garland.","This was a matter of major concern in the construction industry. It arose from a decision by the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 721, which was upheld on appeal. The Minister of Labour and Manpower for the Province of Nova Scotia took the position that there were only two methods by which an employer can become bound by collective agreement and those are (1) certification and (2) voluntary recognition. In the absence of any statutory provisions, that is quite true. However, by virtue of sections 89 et seq of the Trade Union Act the legislature has provided for a rather hybrid scheme of labour relations applicable to the Construction industry. The employer can assign its bargaining and negotiating rights to an accredited employers' association. The Labour Management Bureau is just such an association. These provisions, in effect, provide for a third method of union recognition 'quite apart from certification and voluntary recognition.' HELD: The Minister was bound by s. 107(4) of the Act. There was sufficient ground to grant an order of mandamus with certiorari in aid ordering the Minister to exercise his discretion according to law as set out in Part 2.

The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","The respondent applied to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment including his contribution to child care expenses as well as access provisions.

What had changed was that his mother was no longer available to provide child care during the day on the Saturday of his access weekends. This order was made in order to provide some predictability for the children. It does not constitute a variation of the custody/access regime but rather, specific directions with respect to execution of the access regime."
e_2007skpc90.txt,"The plaintiff sues the defendant town for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. She alleged that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The Town of Martensville disputes that such instructions were given and that, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as result of the water not being turned off, but rather because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The Court could not find on the evidence clear instructions given by the plaintiff to the town to disconnect the water service. To the contrary, the form executed by her daughter clearly indicated request for final billing. This however cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes, thereby making any adjustment in the price of the property difficult to assess.  2)The court cannot find that clear instructions were provided by the defendant to the Town to disconnect water service were clearly indicated. The form clearly indicates request for last billing. The evidence demonstrates a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This is not an occasion to be negotiated. 3)The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. No order as to costs."

The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own. The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university. The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008. The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","FIAT The parties filed an application for an order varying child support.

9_2006skca114.txt,"This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c.1.

The sentence was set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition were imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1)The sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit, failing to take into account the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the respondent, the criminal history and other circumstances of the offender, and his need for psychological and substance abuse counseling and further education. The principles of deterrence were not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor was specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2)The respondent had already served the 90 day closed custody portion of the sentence originally imposed. He was to serve 12 months in closed custody to be followed by a period of community supervision of 6 months and a 1/2 year probation. There was no suggestion in the decision that deterrence was a factor."

The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation. The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence. The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers. The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims. The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances. He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times. He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent after a sentencing circle.

The key factors are the nature of the hurt feelings and their impact on the plaintiff's lifestyle, together with their past and projected duration. 2) In assessing general damages the court found that the injuries sustained by the plaintiff as result of the defendant's assault were serious but not life threatening.

6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. At the time of the jury trial, the issue of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench's jurisdiction to deal with entitlement to holiday pay was being determined by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. The defendant asserted that the plaintiff's holiday pay should be based on his wage, plus one-half of his truck expense allowance. HELD: The jury trial was to be held in front of myself as judge alone and would deal with the issues, both factual and legal, with respect to the claim for holiday pay. In the alternative, the defendant claims that the doctrine of estoppel or waiver should apply to prevent the plaintiff from claiming his holiday pay for 10 years and the defendant asserts that it would be substantially prejudiced if the plaintiff was now allowed to assert that right.  1) The plaintiff clearly indicated that the $250.00 portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. He further claimed that the holiday pay owing should be calculated on the basis of his wage and his truck allowance. 2) The defendant claimed that if the court found that the defendant's all-inclusive contract was not all inclusive or that it did not exceed the minimum standards set out in the LSA, the time the plaintiff spent away from work must be considered holidays.  3) The court reviewed the various pleadings and the issues on which to base any holiday pay entitlement is his monthly wage and benefits, based on the 40 hour work week, as he was a'manager' within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act and therefore not entitled to overtime. 4) The Court reviewed the numerous other pleadings that were made in relation to the same subject matter. 5) In the meantime, the plaintiff may rely on s. 33 to establish that the allowance was really wage disguised for the purposes of avoiding paying income tax in the event that the court determined this Court had jurisdiction to determine the entitlement to holidays. The Defendant asserts that the plaintiffs hours of work were very flexible in the winter. It was only in the first winter of his employment that he was required to be at work 30 hours per week. He did not put in the time for sick days, including time off for leg operation, but he was never required to keep track of those days off. He said generally he was able to take the time"
b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","HELD: The Court found that s. 300 and 301 of the Criminal Code constitute an unreasonable limitation of one or more of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 2, s. 11(c) and s. 12(d) of the Charter. The accused were found guilty of publishing a matter without lawful justification or excuse that was likely to injure the reputation of a police officer by exposing him to hatred, contempt or ridicule or that was designed to insult the police officer knowing that the matter published was false and did thereby commit an offence contrary to s.300 of the Code. The Court applied the test of proportionality, which was met by the application of a plea of justification consisting of 17 typed pages which, for the purposes of this application, need not be reproduced."

Further, the defendant had a duty to use a reasonable standard of care in the operation of the hazardous tree removal program. The defendant was negligent in failing to train the inspector properly.

He was now a paraplegic. The plaintiff's action against the defendants Redden and Lockhart was discontinued. This defendant had joined a third party as a Third Party seeking contribution and/or indemnity from them. HELD: The Court found that in order to establish that a duty of care arises in a particular situation, it is necessary to bring the facts of that situation within those of previous situations in which a duty has been held to exist. The Court also found that it was necessary to articulate a policy of preventing tort actions from becoming vehicle for judicial interference with decisionmaking that is properly exercised by other branches of the government and protecting the Government from liability that would seriously handicap efficient government operations."

The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","The respondent's IRB for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident was not less than the IRB calculated for the first 180 days after the accident. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. HELD: SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the respondent's net income was in keeping with the purpose of the legislation. 1) SGI was correct in applying Regulation 102 which states that interest payable pursuant to Part VIII is to be calculated in accordance the Pre-judgment Interest Act. The Act is intended to correlate the non-earner's income replacement benefit against which s.117(4) is designed to be measured is that of 'weighted average' calculation. 2) The hearing judge's interpretation conflicts with the provisions of s.112(3) of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations and otherwise renders meaningless several sections of the Regulations, particularly s.24(1) thereof. 3) The respondent was awarded an amount less than that of the respondent. The respondent took issue with the SGI reduction. SGI is correctly deducting the amount of Canada Pension Plan benefits Montgrand is receiving. The parties brought the matter back for further determination because the respondent was paying the respondent $28,889.75. 4) The interpretation of statute which produces the greatest harmony and least inconsistency is the construction which ought to prevail."

4_2000canlii2633.txt,"The parties were married for 14 years and separated in 1995, entering into a detailed Separation Agreement in 1998. The two children of the marriage are 16 and 8 years of age. There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment. The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training. For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00 The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since. The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment. This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties. The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose. Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001.

HELD: The Divorce Judgment will be issued forthwith. 1) This is an exceptional situation that requires some adjustment with respect to the Agreement reached by the parties and filed May the 13th, 1998. It must be acknowledged that the parties have never had any financial stability in part because they far too readily accessed credit based on future expectations of capacity that have never been realized and they would be wise to cease utilization of credit for short term relief.

This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants. The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","The plaintiff applied to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant, Great Canadian Bingo Corp., on the ground that the designated officer of the corporation failed to appear at an examination for discovery on the basis of an appointment. The plaintiff's solicitors had on several occasions telephoned the defendant's solicitor to schedule examinations for discovery and to obtain statements as to documents. None of the calls were returned. The defendant's solicitor, who had previously represented the plaintiff, failed to show up for the examination. The defendants' solicitor, who was representing the plaintiff at the time, was also unable to attend. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The defendants were guilty of contempt of court.  2)The defendant corporation was not compellable to attend the scheduled examinations.  3)The non-attendance of the Dions on November 23, 1993, do not constitute'refusing or neglecting to attend' within the meaning of Rule 231. It cannot be utilized respecting these particular non- attendances to strike their statements of defence.  4)The Dions now apparently reside out of province. Their conduct can be characterized as contemptuous.  5)As the plaintiff now apparently resides in British Columbia, the defendant corporation is not a proper officer or director of the Corporation.  6)The plaintiff was granted leave to file two affidavits of the defendant solicitor. 7)It is inherent in Rule 231 that a person must be legally able to attend a time and place appointed for his examination before he can be found to be ""refusing, neglecting or failing to attend"". It is inherent that Rule 231 requires a person to be legally competent to attend such an examination before one can be deemed to be refusing or neglected to attend within it.  7)In view of the past abuses, the defendants shall not be entitled to any conduct money for the initial attendances at the examinations for the discovery or for any subsequent attendances required for the completion of the examinations. 8)The Court was satisfied however that the defendants had continued to duck and weave, fraudulently set the date and time for their examinations. The contempt proceedings were still before the court even though they were adjourned sine die."
1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","The appellant was an employer and the respondent union. By successorship, they are parties to a collective agreement signed in 1994 with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996.

The employer sought to strike the respondent's statement of claim on the ground that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The respondent appealed. Appeal allowed; the Chambers judge erred in allowing the court's action to continue. The Chambers judge's reasoning was that, where there is doubt about the arbitrability of the dispute, that issue should generally be determined initially at arbitration.

He contended that he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice inasmuch as he had evidence that his estranged wife, out of a desire for revenge, had lied about what occurred. The trial judge found both to be credible witnesses. The appellant also rejected the appellant's account, finding him not credible. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)There are procedures that have to be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence. These procedures were not followed and there was nothing before the Court upon which it might act. 2)There is no tenable basis for allowing his appeal, setting aside his conviction, and ordering a new trial.

The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","Sterling Farm, one of the defendants in the main proceeding, moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it, pursuant to Rule 44.10. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had interfered with the plaintiff's timber harvesting contract and sought a change of the place of the proceeding from Halifax to Windsor. The defendant argued that the attachment order was an intrusive pre-trial remedy and that its existence would hinder any attempt by the plaintiff to resume or expand its operations. HELD: The application was to continue to be heard in Halifax and the main action – i.e. the trial – would be held in Windsor. Costs were awarded to the applicant of $1,000 payable in any event in the cause. 1)The affidavit of February 28, 1991 did not properly incorporate the contents of the statement of claim.

This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration.

4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT: 1) The respondent applied for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s.7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, being October 2005. The petitioner, Evan Gavelin, requested joint custody with specified access. While he acknowledged an obligation to pay child support and there was an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive, the petitioner had not received any income from the company prior to the separation and the parties had discussed a verbal agreement that the petitioner would have the children during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. While the petitioner's income was substantially less than the respondent's, there was no evidence that the respondent had paid child support on an interim basis. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basic ongoing needs.  2) Retroactive child support is warranted. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement which the parties entered into following their separation. While it is common for support provisions to be based on the prior year's earnings, as the best evidence of income is often year end income statements and tax returns, the Court is not prepared to vary the terms of that agreement. Given the age and circumstances of the children, there is nothing in the evidence before the trial judge sufficient to rebut that presumption."
d_2009nssm48.txt,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This is an appeal by the Landlord from an order of the Director dated August 31, 2009. That order effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy. It also denied the landlord's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the landlord effectively refused to renew for another year. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the tenancy has not been converted into a monthly to month. The reasons for the refusal by the landlord are that the lease is much more difficult to lease out at any time of the year other than September 1. In the unique circumstances of this case, it is appropriate that the tenant and not the landlord incur that risk.  1)The lease has been renewed for one year and expires in August 2010. The landlord has the advantage of the landlord's undertaking to accept an early termination. Also, the tenant has the ability to sublet, if he determines that he wants to leave early. 2)An arbitrary decision would be one that is random or based on purely personal whim. An unreasonable one would have no credible rationale behind it. The risk of vacancy falls on the tenant. The tenant is entitled to make a reasonable business decision and not be second guessed by tenants, Residential Tenancy Officers or Adjudicators simply because they do not agree with him."

2007skqb376.txt,"The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated.

The plaintiff brought an application for mandamus to compel the defendant to hold a new hearing and filed two affidavits providing some detail and background information as to its reasoning for its failure to attend the hearing and the parties' differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. The defendant brought an application to strike certain of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff on the basis that they were an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not forming part of the record. Application to strike affidavits dismissed; the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible. There was no authority for denying the parties the use of affidavits should this application proceed as a jurisdictional dispute and, should it proceed by way of an error of law on the face of the record, the affidavits were also admissible to complete the record.","The applicant board applied to have the affidavits of two of the applicant board members struck out as an attempt to put evidence to the Court on matters not in or forming part of the Record of the Council Panel in its adjudicative setting. The applicant board had refused to appear at the hearing because their request for adjournment had been denied, leaving council with no decision to make. In its original application (S.K. No. 276502), the Board sought declaratory judgment raising these questions: 1) does the board have jurisdiction to hold a hearing on an application for certiorari; and 2) if it does, is it admissible to show that the record was incomplete, as for instance, that the conviction omitted the evidence of one of the witnesses; and if it is to be denied on the basis of error of law on the face of the record, then affidavits are admissable to complete the records.

In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","HELD: Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. The Court found that Roper breached its contract and that it was not entitled to rely on the exclusion from liability provisions in it. The court awarded $270,307.05 to the appellant. These damages related mainly to the costs incurred by Devco in obtaining substituted performance of the contract and the refund of overpayments made to Roper for which no work had been performed. The appeal should be dismissed."

The court found that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right because it was in excess of the amount due. The judgment was also set aside on the merits. It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action. As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act.

6_1994canlii3963.txt,"The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana, contrary to s. 4(2) and 6(2) of the Narcotic Control Act. RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road. They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants. At trial, the court held their right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure had been violated, and acquitted them. The Crown appealed the acquittal. Per Roscoe, J.A., Chipman, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that there was no s. 8 breach because the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the field where the marijuana crop was growing. The court reviewed case law regarding 'open fields', and 'uncultivated' lands, and adopted the reasoning in Oliver v. United States, 104 S.Ct.1735(1984) in reaching its conclusion. Per Pugsley, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that the respondents had a reasonable expectation of privacy in activities carried on by them on their private property. As there were no exigent circumstances, the search was not reasonable and the evidence should be excluded.","The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana contrary to s. 8 of the Criminal Code. A voir dire was held to determine the admissibility of evidence obtained by the police as a result of the seizure of marijuana plants. The respondents argued that the search was unreasonable and that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy in the clearing where the marijuana plants were growing. The trial judge found that the police did not have reasonable grounds for their belief that the property searched contained narcotics, that they only had a mere suspicion, and the warrantless search was invalid. The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The court adopted the reasoning of the Supreme Court in Katz v. United States (1993), which held that warrantless searches are not prohibited under s. 10 of the Charter. It is not necessary to determine if the searches were unreasonable and if so, whether the evidence should be excluded or not."

Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences.

HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The trial judge erred by granting the motion for a directed verdict based on the discrepancy between the date of the offence alleged in the Information and the evidence presented at trial because the defendant was not a holder of an firearms licence. Alternatively, if the trial judge used the word 'elements', that the date was not the only insufficiency. 2) Crown counsel applied to amend the Information to conform with the evidence. 3) At the conclusion of the hearing the court announced that this appeal was allowed with reasons to follow."

In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary. A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48. In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided. Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance. Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial. The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action. The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied.","The defendant applied for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The plaintiff was responsible for an inordinate and legally inexcusable delay in pursuing its action against the defendant. The defendant was an Indian Band within the meaning of the Indian Act and the Councilor of the said Band was the appropriate representative of Ochapowace to be examined for discovery on behalf of the defendant; the plaintiff was unable to obtain the information from other persons as there were no persons the defendant was entitled to examine without the requested Order; and it was in the interests of justice that the plaintiff be permitted to pursue its claim.

5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with care or control of a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. 1)The accused had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample.  2)The Court reviewed the principles set out in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA (CanLII), [2002] S.J. No.14 and held that the police officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. He wisely waited until medical personnel made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand."

The accused received the benefit of conditional sentence in April 2006 and in July was found to have breached the orders which formed part of the conditional sentence.

1994canlii4796.txt,"The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer. In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan. There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","The applicant sought a declaration under s63 of the Personal Property Security Act that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the 'Group Plan') was not subject to a security interest she granted to Crown Life. She further sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the plan. HELD: The application for a restraining order was denied. 1)The provisions of s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act do not apply to the applicant. 2)The loan agreement contains no provision enabling Crown Life to collapse the applicant's account in the Group Plan and thereby create an attachable pension refund. 3)The applicant has not retired and there appears to be no monetary sum current for Crown Life which could be set off unless a proper request for a transfer has been made by her. 4)The application for restraining order is denied. 5)The provision prohibiting the applicant from pledging her interest to the Group plan contravenes s. 146(2) and s.147(2). The loan agreement provides that upon an annuitant's coverage terminating, the applicant is to remain in place. Since Ms. Corscadden has not received a pension from Crown Life and there is no evidence of her having retired or of any retirement benefit arising as outlined in the Plan Contract and the reasons in Phenix apply. The applicant is entitled to a refund of any outstanding amounts owing under the loan agreement pursuant to s.7.1 of the PPSSA. 6)The loans agreement provides for the taking of security for loan on a Group Plan in two events. Cancellation of her employment is insufficient and the provisions of ss 146(12) and (13) are of no assistance in light of the provisions. If Crown Life is required to repay the amount owing under this loan agreement prior to its registration being revoked, Crown Life will assume the security interest of the applicant and the proceeds of the plan will be used to purchase a pension refund upon her retirement age. 7)There was no evidence that Crown Life had received a loan agreement in the amount of $3,000 from the applicant prior to her termination of employment for any reason.  8)Since the applicant had not retired, there was no prospect of Crown Life receiving any monies due under the Plan contract. 9)The applications for restraining orders were denied. 10)A restraining order denied."

The Department of Social Services had been involved with the family since the birth of the oldest child. The children had been in the care of the Minister at various times and parent aides provided help to the parents when there was child or children at home. The Minister called 18 witnesses. HELD: All three children were committed permanently to the Minister. 1)The mother appeared to be more anxious about excusing the father, who was an abusive alcoholic, than about protecting the children. The mother was unable to parent any of the children on her own. It was concluded under s.11(b) of the Act that there was no adult person able and willing to provide for the children's needs and physical or emotional harm may come to the children if it had not already. 2)The father had recently pleaded guilty to sexual assault on an eight year old girl which could, depending on the facts be a ground under s.11(a)(iii) of the Act for a finding of need for protection.","The Minister of Social Services sought an order under s.37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act permanently committing to the Minister all three of the children. The Department had been very much involved in the adoption process. The mother had been diagnosed as having Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and had been attending classes with the idea of getting her grade and eventual grade XII. She apparently exhibited symptoms of ADD and was referred for medical diagnosis which found there to be an ADD. She was placed on medication and had not shown any change in her attitude or ability in relation to parenting. She had always been more anxious about excusing herself than about protecting the children and had always appeared more anxious to excuse herself than to protect them against their exposure to domestic disharmony and violence. HELD: The application was reserved. 1)The mother was not able or unwilling to take action to protect the children against the abuse of the domestic abusers. 2)She was not capable of supervising or protecting them. 3)There was nothing in the evidence that suggested that the mother was incapable of caring for the children herself. Something in the mother's makeup that she cannot overcome was the fact that when she failed to properly supervise or protect them it was either because she did not recognize the needs of the child or if she did, she cannot will herself into action. 4)The child had been in the care of the Minister for six years. Since the birth of the oldest child, L, she had been given safe haven with the Department's assistance for herself and the children, but she has always been anxious and unwilling to excite or protect the child. 5)She has always appeared less anxious than excused herself than she did about protecting them against the children.' 6)The evidence showed that the children's exposure to the domestic violence and disharmon may have harmed and would likely further harm the children emotionally."
c_1999skqb178.txt,"Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute. The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in this proceeding, there were also questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial with the court's'repugnance' with respect to such conduct as voiced in the Reddick case. After listening to the tapes in their entirety, I am of the view they have the opposite effect. They speak volumes about the father's character and motivations while shedding little light on the mother's. HELD: The tapes were admitted to their entirety on the condition they went in unedited.  1) Although custody was of central importance to the parties' relationship, there are also questions regarding the mother’s parenting habits and her dysfunctional relationships with the children. 2) Although the father was not represented at trial, with the same degree of repugnance, and with the utmost reluctance, the court allowed the tapes to be admitted here in their totality but on condition they go in un edited.  3) The mother was insistent that the father had been on the phone 23 minutes while [L.C.D.] cried because he did not want to be at his mother‘s house. 4) The court was of the opinion that the tapes were inadmissible unless their authenticity is established, they are shown to be true and unaltered record, and the voices have been properly identified. 5) The father had no redeeming excuse for such calculated, offensive and immature behaviour. His opening bid was to introduce into evidence some 14 hours of telephone conversations he taped with the wife and children which he forcefully asserted would demonstrate the level of abuse occurring in the petitioner's home. Only by hearing the tapes, he suggested, could the Court truly understand the nature of the child's violent nature. The court should not avoid the opportunity of hearing the children in their own words."

HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996.

The petitioner failed to pay the indebtedness owing to the petitioner. HELD: The petitioner was ordered to submit to cross-examination on his affidavit and notice disputing petition. 1)The petitioner had not proven to the satisfaction of the Bankruptcy Court that the respondent has committed an act of bankruptcy within the six months preceding the filing of the third petition. 2)There was no extenuating circumstances which would warrant the Court refusing to grant a receiving order. 3)Ashton was a very clearly indebted to them in the amounts claimed."

It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","HELD: The court found that the respondent had the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 Variation Order as it was a final order issued by consent of the parties in accordance with their prior agreement. The court ordered the respondent to pay retroactive child support in the amount of $21,645 to be paid in installments of $601.25 for 36 months. The respondent applied to the Court of Queen’s Bench for a variation of the 2006 Consent Child Support Order to reduce child support to the children of his former marriage. Turcotte J. found the 2008 variation order to be an interim order, which had implications for the interpretation of the 2011 variation order. The parties agreed to fix support by varying a previous order in 2012. The appellant appealed. He argued that the court drew a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. HELD: Whether the Court can vary an interim or final order on a child support is governed not by common law principles but by the Divorce Act, RSC 1985. 1) The court held that in the area of family support orders, the courts draw a clear line between interim order and final order. In the case of the appellant, the Court held that the appellant erred by misapprehending the facts when he found the appellant did not advise the appellant of changes to his circumstances. 2) The appellant had not been advised of changes in circumstances. 3) The appeal was dismissed with costs of $1,500 to be awarded to the appellant. 4) It was important not to confuse the two lines of authority as to whether the court could vary the 2010 Variation order with respect to arrears arising prior to it issuing. The Court found that there was no expressly legislated power to vary such an order."
6_2004skca37.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] We do not need to hear from counsel for the respondent. I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'. He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them. [5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5. [6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access. The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise. The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child.","Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the best interests of the child.

2_2010skpc149.txt,"The accused were both charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","HELD: The Court found both the accused guilty of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The accused were both charged with wilful damage to the car. Both accused admitted to breaking the front passenger window of the vehicle and that they had purchased some cocaine for a person named Kenny Bear whom they were going to meet in the area of the nightclub. The Crown was unable to prove the cost of repairing the windows was under $5,000. The Court also found the accused not guilty of the second count on information 24414281. Both the accused were found guilty of wilfully damaging the windows of a car contrary to ss. 266 and s. 430(4) of the Code. HELD: 1) The physical altercation in this case was precipitated by jealousy or by a drug deal gone bad, there is no doubt that the actions of the two accused were aggressive. 2) This was threatening behaviour and McIntyre when he said that he felt threatened was not there to apologize. As McIntyre said in his testimony, the accused's only apology was that they were trying to break the back passenger window.  2) The Court concluded that the accuseds were justified in using force to defend themselves or any one under protection from assault, if he uses no more force than is necessary to prevent the assault or the repetition of it. 3) Whether the physical altercation was a result of jealousy or caused by a Drug Deal Gone Bad, there was no doubt they were the aggressors throughout. He smashed in one, if not two, car windows. He chased after McIntyre with Dagenais' help. Once at the trailer he rushed up the stairs toward McIntyre. McIntyre called for the police. As the police arrived, they heard a commotion outside the trailer park. When McIntyre went to the door to tell his brother what had occurred, he was attacked and punched and kicked in the rear window. He ran up the steps toward the trailer and was confronted by the accused. The police arrived and arrested McIntyre and his girlfriend. They were charged with assault on McIntyre, assault causing bodily harm, breach of a motor vehicle, breaking a window, threatening behaviour, and threatening behaviour. The three photographs of McIntyre were taken at the scene of the assault and were used as evidence in the trial. The two accuseds who accompanied McIntyre to Rockcees were convicted of assault upon McIntyre on the basis that they both had consumed less than a case of twelve beer between 5:00 p.m."
c_2004nsca135.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, with the only live issue at trial being whether the Crown had proved the absence of the complainant's consent beyond a reasonable doubt. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review. The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt. It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.","A cocaine fuelled encounter between the appellant and the woman with whom he was living resulted in his conviction for assault and sexual assault. The appellant appeals the sexual assault conviction, submitting that it is unreasonable, is based on misapplication of the burden of proof and that the judge's reasons are so deficient as to constitute an error of law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There was ample evidence which, if believed, justified the conviction. The judge applied the proper test and applied his or her mind to the possibility that despite having rejected the evidence of the complainant, there might nevertheless be a reasonable doubt about guilt."

At the time of this agreement the marriage was already in difficulty.","This was an appeal from a corollary relief judgment dividing matrimonial assets and from an order for support of the children of the marriage, with respect to its effective commencement date.

3_2002skca56.txt,"A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services). The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order. It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance.

An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit. Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.",HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was dismissed with costs.

8_2015skqb144.txt,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The Court ordered interim shared custody of the parties. The parties had been in an intimate relationship for some time. The petitioner claimed under The Children’s Law Act, 1997, C-8.2 [Act], sole custody of Z., specified and supervised parenting time for the respondent, restraining order against the respondent and costs. The respondent claimed division of property under The Family Property Act (F-6.3), joint custody of T. and S. with primary residence of Z. and access for Ms. J. and Mr. S. respectively. HELD: 1) The Court found that the parties had not spoken since the parties’ separation. 2) The court ordered the parties to proceed to an expedited pre-trial conference. It ordered the parents to have Z. on a shared week-on/week-off basis. 3) The parties were to have a provisional agreement to tide things over until trial could be held. 4) There was no evidence that the petitioner telephoned the respondent to try and get him to return to her house. 5) The petitioner had not seen Z. since December 2012.

After extended negotiations the defendant eventually signed and mailed the standard form contract but never received an executed copy. The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993. The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price. HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action. 1)There was a valid contract between the parties. Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94. The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions. Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.  4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem.

His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","The plaintiff was charged with dangerous driving causing death. Following the laying of criminal charges, the plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay and offered to use their legal counsel to defend him in relation to the criminal charges. The plaintiff appealed the decision of the Court of Appeal which held that the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence the video re-enactment of the accident that had been prepared by Cst. Thivierge and, in allowing into evidence, the opinion of the RCMP Traffic Analyst when there was an insufficient factual basis established for his opinion. HELD: The Court found that the appeal court did not have the benefit of this information when arriving at their decision and in commenting as they did on the defendant's failure to object to the admission of this evidence. The evidence should not have been introduced by the Crown, nor should counsel have referred to the theory in summation."

The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions. The plaintiff is a councillor. The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the parties is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care.

b_2002skpc50.txt,"An application for a DNA warrant on the basis s.487.05 (the general warrant provision) of the Criminal Code with respect to DNA warrants does not refer to a form. The applicant suggested a tape recording would avoid the potential problems in bringing the application before a Provincial Court Judge. HELD: These concerns were raised in the January 21 decision concerning potential prejudicial or negative effects, which outweigh any requirement to swear the Information before a judge. An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance. The intention is to make protocol work as flexible as possible, not impeding the police in their legitimate role, while making sure the court maintains its independence. Form 5.01 is specifically set out in the Code. Section 487.1 does not have a form, but even if it did and used the same words 'taken before me', that would elevate form over substance in a significant way.","This was an application for a DNA warrant under s.487.05 of the Criminal Code.

At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code.

HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. 1)The evidence of speeding, bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle was insufficient to support a conclusion of a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist. 2)The words 'had consumed alcohol' were insufficient to justify the defence application to exclude a Certificate ofalyses based upon a breach of ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter. 3)There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the second count, same is dismissed against the accused. The Crown conceded that if such Charter breaches were found, the appropriate remedy would be to exclude s.24(2). 4)On reflection, and having given careful consideration to the cases cited, I am persuaded that the words had consumed alcohol are indeed insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable belief there was alcohol in her body at the time of the ASD demand."

e_2006skqb534.txt,"The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the respondent had not engaged in blameworthy conduct and that the annual increases of the payor parent's income over the years 2002 to 2005 were not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children.

e_2010skca79.txt,"The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. He appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter were too severe.

The trial judge reviewed the evidence and concluded that the appellant could have outrun the police officer. 2)The appellant was not persuaded by the Crown's argument that the photographs were of the appellant and that, in the course of her charge, the trial judge suggested the jury might wish to consider whether, with two or three second head start after the car chase, Mr. Holoboff could have successfully outrun Constable Badger. The jury was advised that the Crown was entitled to introduce both pictures because both had been shown to the complainant before the search. She did not believe the jury would see them as being mug shots. 3)The trial judge raised concerns about the appellant’s credibility.

Awarding 5 months interest, that the date from which interest is calculated in this type of action is upon completion of the appeal process. An appropriate interest claim under s. 41(I) therefore only exists for the five month period between the Court of Appeal's assessment determination and the refund of the property tax five months later.","The plaintiff municipal tax payer paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total amount of $420,177.13. Canada Trust sought interest pursuant to s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act on the amount of the refund from the date it made the overpayments in response to HRM's tax invoices requiring payment of those amounts on the due dates. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld the Utility and Review Board's assessment determination which translated into the overpayment of taxes. HRM paid the refund of overpaid real property taxes to Canada Trust, pursuant to the Assessment Act, supra on the principal amount and on the unpaid interest until the date of judgment. HELD: 1)There was no cause of action for return of any over payment of taxes until after the appeal provisions were exhausted. An interest rate of 8.75% being a rate equatable to the interest charged by HRM on overdue taxes (prime plus 4 %) is an appropriate rate on principal amount for the five month period between the Nova Scotia court of appeal assessment determination in March 1997 and the payment of the property tax refund in September 1997. 2)Canada Trust did not seek the alternative remedy of entitlement to interest on the interest based on unjust enrichment. 3)An appropriate interest claim does exist under s41(i)(i)of the Judicialature Act. 4)The date when it could be said to be a 'overpayment' of taxes does not change or revert back to an earlier date when the tax payments were remitted because the appeal process has concluded. 5)The amount of over paid taxes was not a debt until March 1997.

The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44.

The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","The accused pled guilty to three counts of fraudulently and without a colour of right, use credit card data that would enable a person to use a credit card or to obtain the services provided by the issuer of credit card to credit card users contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was sentenced to four years and nine months imprisonment with a global sentence of eight years and six months. The credit should be one for one or put otherwise, the time actually served on remand. 1)The gravity of the offences was very high because of a number of aggravating circumstances. 2)The accused was imprisoned but this had no effect on him. 3)There clearly was pre-meditation and careful planning in advance.

d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Chambers judge arising out of an interpleader application by the Shubenacadie Band Council to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owing by the Band under a construction contract entered into by the respondent. The respondent made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specified to the various claimants. The judge concluded that by reason of s. 89(1) of the Indian Act the only claimant not barred by the section was the Eskasoni Band being the only Indian entity of the several claimants. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs. 1)The Chambers judge misinterpreted the Act and the sum of $70,000 is entitled to payment over the assignee whose assignment pre-dated that of the notifying assignee but who failed to give notice to the Band before the subsequent assignee gave notice. 2)The respondent was an Indian, a member of the Esquimalti Band and resided on a reserve in Cape Breton. His assignment was made in good faith and for valuable consideration and not for the mere purpose of protecting the book debts therein mentioned against the creditors of the assignor or for the purpose of preventing such creditors from recovering any claims which they have against the debtor. 3)There was no statutory registration system in place at the time the Act was passed. The appellant could not effectively transfer an interest in the amount owing to him from his customers as there was nothing left upon which the assignment to the respondent could operate."

Held, motion dismissed. Under Rule 14.01, the motions judge must decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. The party seeking production must establish relevance. Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location.

He had a previous record for non-violent offences., defendant sentenced to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment; aggravating factors included the defendant's possession and use of a handgun in an area where a number of people were close by and that a bullet had found its way into a nearby residence.","The accused were jointly charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in relation to shootings that occurred in the early morning hours of December 10, 2006. The accused had been on bail for 17 months at the time of the offence. HELD: A sentence of 9 ½ years should be imposed with a credit on a 2 for 1 basis for the defendant's pre-trial custody and a credit for time spent on post-trial release.  1)An aggravating factor was that handguns were used in an area where a number of people were close by at the after hours bar known as Vegas. Quite a few shots were fired and two persons died as result of the gunfire. The offender was acquitted of the two counts and he is not being sentenced for those offences today. 2)The nature and circumstances of this offence and the character of the accused were aggravating factors. The offence before this Court was particularly serious one. The defendant had a prior criminal record for non-violent offences such as fraud, possession of a controlled substance and careless storage of a weapon. There was a serious threat to the safety and security of the persons living in that residence as well as to those who were congregated on the outside porch of that bar shortly before the shooting began. The presence of at least 2, probably handguns being fired in the area where the victims were killed and a DNA order was ordered. 3)The sentence imposed today reflected society's abhorrence of those who decide to live by the gun and use the gun to settle disputes."
b_2011skpc30.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care and control of a motor vehicle and care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while over.08 contrary to s. 253 of the Criminal Code and s. 255(1)(a) of the Code. The accused had obtained a warrant to search for blood samples from the Justice of the Peace on January 10, 2009. The warrant specified that the blood samples were authorized to be taken between the hours of 1:22 o’clock a.m. and 5:22 am. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. 1)The information which was deposed in the Information to Obtain did not constitute reasonable grounds for the belief that the accused had committed an offence under s.253. 2)The Warrant to Search for Blood was invalid.  3)The accused had not deposed that he believed the driver of any motor vehicle, let alone the driver, was the sole occupant of the vehicle, was unconscious with his feet located in the driver’s leg/foot area and the rest of his body slumped across the seat. The Certificate of Analyst and the report from the analyst were admitted into evidence at trial. 4)The officer who swore the information to obtain was found to have failed to provide sufficient detail to permit the justice of the peace to determine that reasonable grounds exist for the warrant."

The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application.

Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act.","This was an appeal from the decision of Judge Levy of the Family Court for the Province of Nova Scotia. He held a pre-trial conference at which time the respondent raised a jurisdictional question, arguing that the payment of the lump sum in 1985 fully and finally discharged his responsibility for child support. The matter was adjourned with no further payment since that time and the respondent had not had contact with the child. In 1993, the appellant made an application for a variation of this order pursuant to s. 37(1) of the Children of Unmarried Parents Act.

Both parents want sole custody of their son. Since they separated in June 1997, the boy has lived alternating weeks with each parent. HELD: The father's obligation under the Federal Child Support Guidelines [Divorce Act Regulations, SOR/97-175] is $226 per month. The mother asks the father to share the extraordinary cost of $40 per month for horse riding lessons. The father is to have access on alternate weekends and for a three-hour period on one weekday each week provided the mother is returned to his mother's home by the bedtime she sets for him.

His obligation under The Federal Child support Guidelines is $225 per month; the father's proportional share of $28 per month is $28. Neither has demonstrated that sole parenting offers an advantage to the boy. Both have full-time jobs. The boy has been cared for by babysitters of their respective choice. The babysitters are members of their own families and are equally competent. [2] The future plan of the mother offers the boy an enormous advantage. She plans to marry her current companion when both of them are divorced from their present spouses. She will then stay at home and be full-partner with the father. She is willing that the boy have generous access to his father. Such an arrangement would be far better for the boy than the present shared parenting arrangement.

5_2000canlii3680.txt,"After being sexually assaulted, applicant was voluntarily released from Canadian Armed Forces. She applied for and was denied a pension. Civil proceedings were commenced and the Crown defended on the basis that before initiating civil proceedings, applicant was obliged to appeal denial of pension or seek review by Minister of pension rejection. Applicant applied to strike out that portion of defence application allowed. The applicant applied for and was denied a pension. Therefore no pension was at this time payable to her. A review by the Minister would require new information and the appeal period had expired. The applicant should not be denied her right to proceed against the Crown in such circumstances.","The plaintiff was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces. She was voluntarily released from the military and applied for a pension under s. 271 of the Criminal Code. In October 1996, the Defence Department re-assessed her release from the Military and ruled that she should have been released on medical grounds, being disabled and not being able to perform the duties of her trade or employment. The Minister of Defence appealed the Minister's decision to deny the plaintiff's pension and brought an application to strike the statement of claim on the basis it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The defence was that since no pension had been paid or awarded, it followed that no pension was payable. The limitation period for appealing the Minister’s decision expired and the plaintiff was not in receipt of pension benefits. HELD: The plaintiff was barred from bringing this proceeding because she failed to appeal in time. 1)Section 111 of the Pension Act or s. of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act cannot be read having regard to the authorities to amount to the proposition that having been denied a pension by the government for sexual assault the plaintiff is now barred in bringing an action for damages against the government claiming that she is now entitled to a pension. 2)The Court held that recourse to alternative bodies is bar to the proceedings. It did not consider the application of s. 111 in Tremblay v. Canada, [1995] F.C.J. No. 1680. The Federal Court of Appeal confirmed on appeal that the plaintiff had not exhausted the grievance procedure provided under the Act and that remedies for dismissed federal employees lay elsewhere and not in civil actions for wrongful dismissal.

The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674. HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. 2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. 4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.","HELD: The application for dependants' benefits was dismissed. The court found that s. 45 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979 was not applicable and that the respondent Board acted outside its jurisdiction in denying the applicant's claim for benefits based upon two alternative grounds: the delay in bringing the claim, and the fact that Truitt was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of the Act.

They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","HELD: The Court granted the application and ordered that the matter of increasing parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue, even an expedited pre- trial conference. 1)The Court found no reason for the denial of the divorce at this stage. In the event the respondent was unable to transport either of the children to their hockey or learn to skate sessions, she shall notify the petitioner and he will be responsible for getting the child to the program. 2)The court found that in the circumstances the parties were in some disagreement regarding the parenting arrangements set forth in Megaw J.’s decision in January 2015. The parties had commenced construction on a new residence in Moose Jaw. The respondent did not agree with the child attending the Montessori program.

HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)Because the accused had no related record and given the circumstances of the assault, the sentence of imprisonment was reduced to time already served (15 days). 2)The trial judge erred in imposing the 10 year fire arm prohibition under S.100 of the Code. S.100 requires a conviction on an indictable offence involving violence against a person where the maximum sentence available is 10 years imprisonment or more. 3)The maximum sentence for assault under S.266 is 5 years if the Crown proceeds by indictment and 6 months if, as here, the Crown proceeds summarily.","The accused was convicted of an indictable offence contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.

2006nssc139.txt,"The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage. The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child. The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","HELD: The Court granted the divorce in accordance with s. 8(1)(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. It deferred the issue of custody and access while they attempted to work out transitional issues with Doctor Landry. The parties entered into a Separation Agreement in 2004. The agreement purported to settle all matters between the parties and was to be incorporated into and form part of the Corollary Relief Judgement in this matter. The petitioner claimed 10 percent of his household expenditures at his tax deductions, using his house to do his administrative work, and using his savings to pay child support and spousal support. The father argued that the particulars of the agreement did not and do not reflect his net business income derived from self employment. HELD: 1) The court found that the parties had reached an agreement that reflected their true financial circumstances and valid agreement. 2) The Court found that it was unfair in that it did not ensure that the father was fully protected by overtly addressing mobility. 3) There was no evidence of undue influence, fraud or evidence that would affect the parties ability to retain and instruct counsel. 4) There were significant changes in the life of the parties since the agreement was entered into."

The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions. However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The accused did not display slurred speech. He appeared to fully comprehend his legal rights and obligations in his communications with the peace officer, peace officer and legal aid duty counsel. 2)The evidence of a very strong smell of alcohol in the vehicle was not a reliable indicator of impairment. The accused's blood alcohol concentration was at least 100 milligrams. 3)The court found that in the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for these tests, the proper method of application, and to comment on their relative reliability, it is not appropriate for the court to rely upon them on the issue of guilt or innocence, to the prejudice of the accused. 4)The Court found that the accused was not displaying any difficulty with balance and coordination. The suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator. The evidence of an erratic driving may evidence impairment of the driver's mental faculties or physical capability, or both, to drive a motor vehicle due to the effects of alcohol or drugs. However, the evidence of the 'classic' signs of impairment which are alleged by the Crown must be considered in the context of the principles contained in R. v. Stellato (1994), 1994 CanLII 94 (SCC), 18 C.R. (4th) 127, in which the Supreme Court of Canada approved the following: 'In all criminal cases the trial judge must be satisfied as to the accused's ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drug. The Crown purported to rely on the results of standardized field sobriety tests, including horizontal gaze nystagmus, heel and toe, and the Romberg test. 5)The Crown must prove that its evidence is credible, and there is no onus on the accused whatsoever in that respect. Although the accused may have been speeding, it must be referred to the scientific standard of application and to the reliability of the tests. 6)The test results of the two physical tests were inconclusive and the accused failed six out of six of the clues. The officer noted that the vehicle wandered somewhat within its lane, it did not stray into the other lane to any extent. 7)Although the accused had not displayed any mental confusion, or noteworthy inappropriate behaviour, the accused did display some mental confusion."

The Court of Appeal issued a decision in October 2003 referred to as Nova Scotia (Minister of Community Service) v. B.F. at 2003 NSCA 119 which confirmed the trial judge had not lost jurisdiction despite the fact that the agency had not made an order for permanent care. HELD: The Court dismissed the motion. 1)Once the determination at a particular stage of the proceeding is made at trial or otherwise, and with the exception of reserving the Court's decision, no order can have effect beyond the statutory deadline.  2)When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for a rushed trial date. There may be need for the preparation of expert reports and other trial preparation and to ascertain whether ongoing further services would have resolved the problem."
7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","HELD: The court found that the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious. The police stopped a car driven by the accused and it was suspected of having been involved in a robbery with a firearm at a specific address in Sackville. The accused was found in the car with the driver, another adult, Cody Muise and two young men, K.M., who had pleaded guilty to the robbery, some drugs, some items reported to have been stolen in that robbery, a gun and brass knuckles. None of the people he described fit the description of the accused. The court concluded that the accused had not been in the courtroom when the police stopped the car but had been picked up at some building somewhere in Fairview."
7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The Court of Queen's Bench found that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence of unlawfully trafficking in forest products. The Crown appealed the sentence imposed on the defendant on a charge of unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The Court held that during the period in the indictment, the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the actus reus on Count No. 1 and Count No 2 of unlawfully possessing forest products, but he held that given the defendant's own words to the undercover operator, he was not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the wood he sold to the defendant and the previous sales (presumably referring to the previous 150 truckloads and the 58 truckloads he sold in 2008 and 2009) were wood coming from private lands. Thus, the appellant court should intervene if the decision is not correct in law unless there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice that has occurred."
8_2017skqb249.txt,"HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel was constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The parties entered into three separate contracts designed to accomplish their business goals. They were (i) the International Distribution and Software Licence Agreement (IDSL); (ii) the Software Customization Agreement (SCA); (iii) the Escrow and Software Modification Agreement (ESMA). HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) A term permitting an appeal from the arbitrators' decision on an error of law simply does not fall into the category of the obvious, or something that goes without saying, in the factual matrix of this case. Such an implied term is not akin, for instance, to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation, or to the term of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment. 2) The provisions of the agreement exclude the right of appeal on questions of law, pursuant to s. 45(2) of the Act. The term should generally not be implied where it is inconsistent with the express terms of the contract. 3) While there are some cases in which term must be implied in order to ensure that the intention of the parties is not defeated, the court does not have licence to reconstruct a contract on equitable principles, or from the point of view of what the parties should reasonably have contemplated. The court can imply terms that are in the nature of things that go without saying but are necessary to give business efficacy to the transaction. The implication of the term must have a certain degree of obviousness to it, and if there is evidence of contrary intention on the part of either party, it cannot be taken to have abrogated its right to appeal. 4) In this case, the parties reached the renewal date in February of 2011 without incident, so the IDSL, SCA and ESMA all contained identical clauses in that agreement. 5) The parties referred to one, and only one, specific instance in which an appeal would be permissible. Questions of fact and law are not of sufficient importance to compel the court to grant leave under s45(2)."

She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control. The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled. Application for summary judgment granted; the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success. The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge.","The defendant's motion for summary judgment arises out of an automobile accident that occurred on May 22, 2001. The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright on Highway 103 when a tractor-trailer passed her vehicle.

The defendant engaged two experts who examined the metal and reported that it did not come from the tractor trailer. The plaintiffs claim damages for injuries to her arms, shoulders and neck. HELD: The defendant has met the threshold test. 1)No trial judge or jury properly instructed would make a finding of negligence against the defendant driver, having considered the body of evidence before them. 2)The plaintiff has failed to adduce evidence to support the bare allegation made in the pleadings. 3)The defendant failed to establish that the piece of debris that hit her car was dangling from the trailer prior to the plaintiff being hit by the same piece. The expert reports established that the metal did not belong to the tractor tractor trailer and that upon inspection there was no place for such a piece to dangle. 4)The expert reports filed by the defendant remain uncontradicted. 5)In asserting that the defendant is liable in negligence for her injuries the plaintiff relies on s. 248 of the Motor Vehicle Act: Onus of proof of liability 248 (1) where any injury, loss or damage caused by motor vehicle upon highway is on the owner and operator of the motor vehicle. 6)The experts' reports establish that this piece of Metal did not exist in the trailer nor upon inspection was there any place for it to be dangled. 7) The defendant correctly relies upon the operation of Civil Procedures Rule 13.01(a) and Supreme Court of Canada judgments, Hercules Management Ltd. v.

The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor.

The accused was severely drunk and had a history of domestic violence. HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of both charges. 1)The evidence was circumstantial. There was no evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the offences against the complainant. 2)The accused had a reasonable chance of being found guilty.

2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.",HELD: The court found that the information provided by the father and his witnesses in respect to the serious and damaging allegations against the mother was credible. The information did not form part of the court's decision. The court ordered that final decisions about the children's regular health and dental care shall be in the mother's authority.

Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions. The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","HELD: The appellant was released from custody pending appeal of his conviction for seven offences relating to careless use of a firearm, possession of a prohibited or restricted firearm and resisting a police officer.

b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial, calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so, and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The Court held that the fairness of these proceedings, as well as the public confidence in the judicial process, warranted an order that the accused be given some latitude at some stage of the trial to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no authority to control.  1)The Court reviewed the authorities which have been filed by the Crown.  2)The court found that in Provincial Court it would be appropriate to have counsel give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, counsel should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application for exclusion is made.  3)The accused was not entitled to sit back and hope that something will emerge from the Crown's case to create a Charter argument or assist in one counsel's prepared remarks."

HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son. This is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years.

The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5) Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794. His income is considerably higher now. His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","HELD: The Court directed a trial on the issues of the residence of the petitioner mother and the incomes of the father and mother, for the purposes of the Federal Child Support Guidelines and any s.7 expenses.

Michael began living with his father at least 40% of the time in September 2006. This ended in January or February 2007. Thereafter, he was supported by his mother. Accordingly, 2006 was not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for Michael. To do so would be exceedingly unfair."

The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","The appellant appeals his conviction for impaired care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s.253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, fined him $1,000 and prohibited him from driving for one year. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in his decision to exclude the evidence of the Crown's defence counsel concerning the appellant's slurred speech as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count. 2)The appellant did not rely on conjecture or speculation as suggested by the counsel for the appellant. The trial judge was in a special position on matters of credibility because of the extreme danger represented by unlicensed or impaired drivers on the roads. 3)There was nothing in the record to indicate that there was any inherent improbability in her evidence or any other basis which would justify interference by an appellate court with the findings of the trial judge. There was some support for her testimony in other evidence which was accepted by the judge."

The employer argues that the plaintiff was dismissed for cause.

At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment. It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her. In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal. Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.  2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004. The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12. But for her dismissal, she would have worked for the rest of July and for the month of August or 36 days. 3) In this case the plaintiff made reasonable effort to seek and maintain employment.

Her employment was terminated when she received a notice that her employment would be terminated. 2)The contract of employment was for an indefinite term or for a fixed contractual period. The defendant advertised for two positions for the period extending from May to August 2004. She was hired as receptionist for an undetermined period.

5_2006nsca41.txt,"The plaintiff company commenced an action against a former employee/shareholder for breach of fiduciary and employee duty. The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company. The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action. The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","The appellants sought an order permitting them to withdraw the admissions and to add a claim for an “oppression remedy” to the respondent’s counterclaim for alleged misdeeds of the former shareholder. The respondent applied for leave to amend the admissions to include the words “suspect” and “former” in the order permitting the application. The appellants argued that the judge erred in allowing the respondent to amend his defence to withdraw certain admissions he made. The judge allowed the application and granted leave to the appellant to appeal. The appellant appealed. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal dismissed. 1)In the circumstances of this case, new counsels need to defend according to counsel's assessment of the facts is a strong reason for concluding that it would be unjust to hold the defendants to the admissions in the defence drawn by former counsel. There are no equities weighing significantly against the justice of the defendants’ request. There was no agreement or undertaking between the appellants and the defendants. 2)The court found that the respondent had not erred by making his decision in the absence of evidence indicating that it was just to withdraw his admissions. 3)The Court found that new counsel was not required to defend the admissions made by the respondent in this case. 4)The respondent was entitled to copies of any and all offers, if any, he would be entitled to. 5)The judge did not err in permitting the applicant to amend its defence. The words used in clause of the order were that the rights of the respondent as a shareholder “are hereby suspended. A reasonable interpretation of these words is that which was given to them by the judge."

There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial. Stay of proceedings granted. At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter.

7_2010nsca95.txt,"The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff. The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent Chrysler on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of Giffin. The appellants argued that the Chambers judge erred in failing to properly apply the law in Bazley v. Pinkerton's of Canada Ltd., 2010 SCC (CanLII). In Bazley, the appellants sought to impose vicarious liability on the national union for the intentional actions of the members of local. The trial judge concluded that only after full trial where the judge might examine all the surrounding circumstances and in which circumstances could be considered would it be possible to decide if waiver had occurred. HELD: Appeal dismissed. Neither the argument that the lease between Chrysler and Giffin was actually a rental contract pursuant to s. 62 of the Motor Vehicle Act, nor the claim that Chysler is an owner pursuant to S. 2(ak), have a real chance of success on the undisputed facts.

The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother.

The evidence showed that the father had not bothered to contact the child from the time he was an infant. 3)Given the facts of this matter, the court was in the best interests of the child to lift the stay.

A custody investigation conducted in 1990 when the mother had first commenced this application had recommended that the existing arrangement be continued. The Father now intended, however, to move with the children to Ontario to take additional education. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed. She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children. 3)In the circumstances of this case the Judge was convinced that the move was reasonable and was not motivated by any desire on the part of the Father to thwart the Mother's access.","This was an application for an order varying the judgment of Dickson J. of the 5th of January 1990 in which he gave judgment for divorce and joint custody to the parents of two boys. The parties had separated in December 1988 and had entered into a separation agreement in which the parties agreed to joint custody, residence with the father and generous access to the mother. The mother sought to have the children move out of Saskatchewan for a short vacation.

The circumstances now are that the father intends to, and if the mother's application is not granted, will take the boys to Ontario for two or possibly three years. 2)The father's reasons for moving to Ontario are not unreasonable if the course he wishes to take is not offered at the Dental College of the University of Saskatchewan. The alternative being requested is to move the boys away from Saskatchewan where their roots are and where their extended family lives, and to a new family unit, if it exists, and how the well-being of that family unit bears on the best interests of the children."
e_2013skca1.txt,"The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","The proposed appellants sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) striking the within action on the ground that it was devoid of merit and that evidence of clients using legal opinions provided by their legal counsel as a marketing tool was so commonly known among tax lawyers that McMillan should have been alive to the practice and should have taken appropriate steps to guard against their opinion letters being inappropriately used for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with the plaintiff. The Chambers judge dismissed the application and certified the action as a class action against the appellants on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and non-client. HELD: The proposed appeal was granted or withheld in the amount of $23,000. 1)The facts, coupled with case law stating a lawyer may owe a duty of caring to a non- client and the evidence of Mr. Davies establish a common issue which appears to meet the requirements of the Class Actions Act. 2)Nothing in the Chambers judge's reasons suggests he applied a rules-based analysis when determining whether'some basis in fact' supported the existence of a recognized 'duty of care' within the meaning of s. 6(1)(c) of the Act. No common issue existed upon which class action could reasonably be certified. 3)The proposed appeal is prima facie destined to fail and not of sufficient merit to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal."

c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused was charged with possession of an unloaded prohibited firearm pursuant to s. 95(1) of the Criminal Code and possession of a loaded prohibited weapon pursuant to ss. 8 of the Code. The accused was also charged with trafficking firearms. HELD: The accused were all found guilty. The essential issue on the charges against the accused was whether they had constructive and/or joint possession of the loaded Mark II rifle, the loaded Cooey sawed-off shotgun, and the loaded AP 9 handgun.  1)The accused were found guilty of possession of firearms and ammunition contrary to both s. 8 and s. 9 of the code.  2)The evidence was found to support the accused’s Charter application in relation to the firearms. The evidence did not support his Charter application. 3)The essential issue was whether the accused had constructive possession of any of the firearms seized from him at the time of his arrest.

Accused guilty of operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit; there was no violation of the accused's right to counsel. The officer had valid grounds to make the demand, having been advised that the accused was in an accident, that someone had said the accused was either high or intoxicated, having smelled a mild odour of alcohol on the accused and the accused having advised him that he only had three beer.

First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The charges relate to events which occurred in April and April 2010 respectively. The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases which, if granted, would require three separate trials in all.

He maintains that the gun was not his and that he had nothing to do with its possession or use either on April 8 or the 14th. This disclaimer is indicative, in my view, that the accused's decision whether to testify would be in the interests of justice.  2)The evidence of proximity on some but not all counts is not necessarily determinative of severance application. It can be counterbalanced by other circumstances that the judge finds may prevent the accused from testifying, or be outweighed by factors that demonstrate the interest of justice require a joint trial."

The deceased and applicant who had been living together purchased residential property in 1997. Their lawyer prepared a written agreement for the sellers and purchasers as well as the mortgage describing the purchasers as joint tenants. The sellers, unrepresented by legal counsel, prepared the transfer of the property and title issued without the words 'joint tenants'.

HELD: The Land Titles Office Registrar was to amend the existing certificate of title by inserting 'joint tenants' after the names of the registered owners. 1)The requirements set out in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Rochon were satisfied. There was an obvious mistake which required rectification. The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did. 2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.","FIAT.

The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The complainant was employed as clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and although she testified that she knew of the accused in 1999, it is much more likely that she met him in the spring of 2002 after he assumed his duties as Justice of the Peace in the same building.

At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.",HELD: The Court dismissed the application to vary the custodial arrangements and ordered the trial to be held in Unified Family Court.

The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties. The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action. Corrigendum received dated July 20, 2006 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff, a representative plaintiff, applies for certification of this action pursuant to the Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight being flight 361 from Punta Cana to Regina and Saskatoon, Canada, on January 21, 2004. The flight was delayed for about an hour and a half at the airport as a result of several evolving mechanical difficulties referred to by the pilot as 'creeping delay'. The defendants opposed the certification application on the basis that none of the five criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act had been met. HELD: The plaintiff's claim does not disclose cause of action. The court should be reluctant to deny plaintiff his or her day in court. 1) The plaintiff is not entitled to punitive or exemplary damages. 2) There is no question that the plaintiff is an international passenger and the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999 are applicable. 3) The rights and obligations of the parties are governed exclusively by the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air (the 'Montreal Convention'). 4) The right of the plaintiff to demonstrate that he or she acted within the scope of his employment is subject to the conditions and limits of liability outlined in the Convention. 5) The court is also dealing with Chapter V, which now recognizes the existence of both a contracting carrier and actual carrier, and thus was of little assistance to the Court.  6) Although no specific case law was provided to the court with regard to the Montreal convention of 1999, there is ample case law with respect to its predecessor, the Warsaw Convention, as to its exclusive remedy for passengers. Those cases include Connaught Laboratories Ltd. v. British Airways (2002), which involved a claim against a commercial passenger airline (Britannia) and package tour operator (Thomson) arising from a crash landing. Although the court found that the claimants had no right of recovery against Britannia in relation to purely psychological injuries, in view of Article 17, liability was established against the plaintiff for psychological injuries not because the tour operator was not covered by the convention but because of the express terms of contract as between the plaintiff and the plaintiff which allowed for the recovery of such damages."
d_2007skqb266.txt,"FIAT: The primary issue is whether the father should pay for tutoring expenses. HELD: 1) The father is not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance. However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400.","FIAT: The matter was before the Court on July 20, 2007. On that date made a number of orders regarding child support as well as an order regarding summer access. The remaining issues to be resolved were: 1) what, if any, should the father pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children? 2) what retroactive support should be ordered in this matter? 3) interim spousal support was ordered pursuant to s. 7(1)(d) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The father will be stretched, but the Sylvan Learning Centre expenses are necessary and reasonable.  4) the father shall contribute his proportionate share of the cost of both childcare costs and Sylvan learning centre expenses being an amount equal to 71% of the total cost. 5) the mother will be satisfied that the father's contribution of $8,000 to the child support payment will be sufficient to meet his child support needs.  6) The father was ordered to contribute his net monthly cash flow remaining in the sum of $1,066.00 while the mother and four children would have available cash flow in the amount of $2,700 per month.  7) s. 15.3(1) of The Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. (2nd Supp.) to give priority to child support in determining child and spouse support applications. In the matter before me, the father was unable to make a spousa support order because the father did not have necessary resources to pay monthly sum to the Mother once he had satisfied his childsupport obligations. The mother was required to bring this motion to obtain an appropriate sharing of s. expenses. The court was directed by s.15.3 of the FSCRA that s.7(1.1) to give a priority to Child and Spousal Support. In this matter, at this interim stage, there is significant conflict on the evidence regarding the payment of loans by the father during this period of time and the issue of whether or not the mother refused to accept payments being offered. If the mother wishes to pursue an issue of retroactive child support she may do so when and if this matter proceeds further to pre-trial."
7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in these proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life is in possession of the funds. It claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the company whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be decided including what persons will be given notice of the proceedings. HELD: The application for interpleader relief is granted. The court will appoint a representative party to advance the case and interests of the insured clients class."
6_2003skqb170.txt,"The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","The appellant was convicted on October 23, 2002 of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a one-year probation order. During argument on behalf of the appellant it was suggested that the trial judge made three errors of law leading to the conviction. One of those errors amounted to an error of law. The trial judge referred to photographs depicting the extent, location and nature of injuries suffered by the complainant when no photographs existed or if they were never tendered in evidence. The appellant was conscious of bears and insects that could threaten the welfare of the complainant at night. After considering as an alternative leaving to notify the police, the appellant decided that his most reasonable course of action was to force the complainant back to the truck for her own safety. HELD: The appeal was allowed and ordered a new trial. 1)The trial judge failed to properly consider the defence of necessity. He was unable to conclude that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced his finding of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. 2)No miscarriage of justice resulted.  3)It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal for the conviction or a conviction for a conviction. 4)The appellant's evidence was devoted to presenting a defence that came from the appellant. It was not necessary for the Crown to prove that the force used by the appellant caused physical injuries. If he believed the appellant when he spoke of the perils that existed at night in the bush and of the lack of reasonable alternatives, there could amount to an air of reality. In such a case he ought to have embarked upon consideration of the three elements prescribed by the Supreme Court of Canada."
e_2001skqb466.txt,"The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.",The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The defendant placed in issue whether it was liable to the plaintiff for the injuries she sustained in the slip and fall and the degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant did not contest the presence of water on the floor in the Superstore although it did not concede that it was the water which caused the plaintiff to slip. 2)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water on a floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. 3)The plaintiff had met the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water in the store.
4_2009skca102.txt,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","The respondent pled guilty to manslaughter arising out of the fatal injuries she inflicted on her seven-month-old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: The appeal should be allowed on the basis of this latter ground.  1) The essential facts are not in dispute. The respondent's acknowledgment of responsibility, her expressions of remorse, her abusive background which may have caused symptoms of PTSD, and her socioeconomic situation all lead to an appropriate sentence within that range. 2) The respondent had a history of drug use, domestic abuse, domestic violence, and mental health problems. She had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 3) The sentence imposed was based on a very narrow range of authorities. The judge was clearly alive to the seriousness of the offence and did not fail to give adequate weight to both the seriousness and the respondent's moral culpability."
e_2000canlii4625.txt,"The accused was charged with four offences relating to a twelve year old girl, including sexual assault and uttering a threat. He was released on bail with a surety. The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 771 for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into the accused. The accused was charged with four offences, including sexual assault, uttering threats, sexual touching under s. 87 and unlawfully having a weapon. HELD: The applications for forfeiture were dismissed. 1)Since the accused would not be able to pay any amount that may be ordered against him, an order for imprisonment under s773 could be triggered. Section 145 of the Code provides its own penalty for failure to appear for trial which is not acceptable in our system of criminal justice. 2)The accused was found to have deliberately left the province to avoid his trial and should be responsible for the full $1,000. The Crown argued that the accused had not understood or been made aware of what was expected of him and his obligations as surety were not explained to him, nor were the potential consequences in the event of default explained."

The youth was facing a variety of charges including failure to comply with conditions of an undertaking; failure to attend court; possession of property obtained by crime; obstructing a police officer. He requested the Youth Court appoint counsel after his Legal Aid lawyer withdrew. Both parents were on social assistance.

The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person.

The father sought to reduce the support contained in the 1997 divorce judgment which incorporated the parties' interspousal agreements regarding custody, access and child and spousal support. The parties were married in 1985 and separated in 1995. The mother was on leave from her employment. When his federal government management position was declared redundant, the applicant received a retiring allowance of $75,646 in May 1997. The respondent opposed the application on the basis there had been no change in circumstances since the judgment was granted; she had no other income than the support payments and child tax credit; alternatively, there were special provisions in the parties' separation agreement which would permit the court to award an amount that differs from the amount prescribed by the Guidelines.HELD: 1)The judgment the applicant sought to vary was made after the coming into force of the Guidelines. It did not however include a determination of child support made in accordance with the Guidelines. There was no change in the childrens' or mother's circumstances. The applicant was unemployed but was still benefiting from his retiring allowance at the time of the order which he no longer enjoyed. A variation was warranted as there had been a change in the father's financial means and circumstances. The Guideline support obligation for two children is $341 per month.  2)It could not be concluded on the evidence presented that there was any special provision in the parties' agreement that directly or indirectly benefited either child. The provision for child support in a specified amount greater than that provided in the Guidelines was not a 'special provision' as contemplated by s17(6.2) of the Divorce Act given the change in circumstances of the applicant whose annual income had dropped from $55,500 to $24,000 a year.  3)No order was made as to costs.","FIAT. The applicant sought to vary the child support provisions contained in a judgment for divorce granted September 17, 1997 to an amount that complied with the Federal Child Support Guidelines. HELD: 1)A child support order was made pursuant to s.17(6.2) of the Divorce Act. The parties entered into an interspousal agreement pursuant to which the respondent had custody of the children and the applicant had reasonable access on reasonable notice. 2)The parties' agreement regarding custody, access and child and spousal support was incorporated into the judgment.  3)Costs were to be determined in accordance with the guidelines."
e_2009skca40.txt,"This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","This was an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant sought to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake. The appeals against both the Clements and the solicitors were dismissed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without prejudice to the factual basis of the contract. The issues raised in the grounds of appeal were factual and the sole matter of significance was whether the central facts on the terms of the agreement, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and conduct of the Clement were supported by probative evidence. There was no doubt that the contract was valid."

The city charged the respondent under the unsightly premises provisions of the Halifax City Charter.

The city appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge did not commit an error in law. S.363(3) of the Halifax City Charter, under which the respondent was charged, refers to land as opposed to buildings, and cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings, a category already dealt with in s.363(6), which covers the unsightliness of buildings caused by neglect, not overt actions.","The appellant sought a conviction under s. 363(3) of the Halifax City Charter for 'owning unsightly properties' contrary to the provisions of the Charter. The trial judge acquitted the appellant of all charges. The Crown appealed. HELD: The Crown's appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge made no error in law. When the legislators turned their minds to the unsightliness of buildings, they drafted subsection 6. This section deals exclusively with wood shavings, paper, sawdust, dry and inflammable grass or weeds. 2)The appellant's argument that the appellant's actions were caused by the owner's overt actions was not supported by the evidence of the Crown witnesses. 3)Section 363 must be interpreted in a manner prescribed by s. 9(5)of the Interpretation Act, R.S.N.1989, as amended. 4)S. 363 (3) is a recent amendment to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 5)Any proposed amendment must be drafted in a way that does not invoke the Charter's 24th Amendment. 6)The Crown argued that the trial judge erred in law in her application of s. 2(b) of The Charter. 7)Criminal Law – Interpretation of a CharterThe Crown appealed the Crown's decision to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The court found that when the legislature turned their mind to the definition of 'unsightly' in the context of the entire section they drafted a section 6 which deals with the same types of things mentioned in subsection including the accumulation of ashes, junk, rubbish, rubbish et cetera. 8)The Court of Appeal was asked to consider the constitutional issue raised."
d_2005nsca71.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. The court disbelieved his evidence, principally because it was found to be internally inconsistent. The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food. There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","The appellant appeals his conviction by Crawford, J.P.C. on a charge of sexual assault. He testified at trial, denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant says that his conviction is a miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his evidence on material misapprehensions of the evidence. HELD: Conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. 1) The judge's misapprehending of evidence was substantial. It ascribed to the evidence about the involvement of Children's Services, relevance that it simply could not have. The inference which the judge drew from this evidence could not be more unjustified. 2) The court found that the appellant's evidence about his treatment of the children did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that he was responsible for such treatment. The judge’s reasons for rejecting the evidence were substantial. 3) The evidence was material. It was in my view, material and essential to the conviction."
d_1990canlii4118.txt,"In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice. The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment. The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months. He was also awarded the loss resulting from the difference in vacation and loss of an auto allowance for the 15 months. For emotional trauma, which lasted only briefly, he received $500.","This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff was an expatriate employee assigned to a Canadian company. He was given a salary of $67,389.00. When he went to Argentina to establish an office for the defendant company, he was told that he could leave the company on three months notice but that the company had no right to give him a further notice of termination. He applied to the Federal Civil Service and was granted a position in a new company. The defendant then gave him a letter confirming his continued employment as manager of the Halifax Office with responsibility for Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, his personal title as Principal Surveyor and his regular pay until December 31, 1986. On termination, the plaintiff was given the option of going back to work or staying in Canada. He chose to stay in Nova Scotia. The agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant contained a clause which stated that if the company desired to terminate the agreement, it would give 30 days notice. The clause did not refer to termination of his employment by the defendant, it related to termination."

With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1) The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum. The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'. This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support. The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist. 2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program. Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year. The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006. It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000. Child support will be ordered based on $53,000 on an interim basis.","The petitioner sought child support and spousal support pending trial.

The petitioner claimed his only source of income was $490 per month from Canada Pension. HELD: The petitioner was entitled to support under the agreement and the circumstances as they presently exist. The court dismissed the application on the basis that it was not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim support. In the circumstances, this is not the appropriate case for the petitioner's support to continue. The Court noted that the parties' relationship was long one (more than 25 years), the roles of the parties and the validity of their agreement was clearly disputed."

b_2006nssc221.txt,"Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement. Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant applied to vary spousal support provisions of the Corollary Relief Judgment dated February 20th, 2003. Although the parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation, the divorce settlement had left the applicant deeply in debt. The parties had agreed that the respondent should be given a substantial lump sum to compensate the applicant for the 'underpayment' of her rental income since the 1st of February 2003. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The Agreement was sound when it was signed, that there had been no material change in the circumstances of either of the parties since its signing or since it was made an order of the Court and the respondent did not take advantage of any vulnerability of the applicant as contemplated by the Supreme Court decision in Miglin (supra). 2)The parties had reached an agreement which incorporated the terms of an agreement signed by the parties in January 2003. 3)The respondent was to pay the applicant $5,500 per month for the first three months of the marriage and $4,535 per month thereafter. 4)The applicant was to receive a lump sum of $500 from the respondent for the amount of her household expenses which she claimed as rental expenses (including the interest on the mortgage). 5)Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law.

The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay.

3_1995canlii6053.txt,"The accused was charged with failing to appear at his trial on a charge of impaired driving. The impaired driving charge was subsequently stayed. When the charge of failing to appear came on for trial the accused claimed a 'lawful excuse' for his failure to appear on the impaired driving charge. His excuse was that the next shift at work had failed to arrive on time and that this had made it impossible for him to get to court on time. This excuse was rejected and he was convicted. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Whether an accused has a lawful excuse is determined with reference to common law principles. It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.","The accused was charged with an impaired driving offence. He attended court and indicated he would be retaining a lawyer. The judge set a return date and informed the accused he must appear personally because the Crown was proceeding by indictment. On the return date the accused did not show up. At issue was whether the accused advanced a 'lawful excuse' for not appearing. HELD: The appeal was challenged on appeal. 1)The accused had failed to attend court by arguing that the trial judge ought to have accepted his excuse for failing to attend. The accused's feelings were further bruised by the fact that the original impaired driving charge was eventually stayed by the Crown. 2)The trial judge rejected the accused's submission that he had a lawful excuse for not attending court. The finding was challenged. 3)The common law defences are not frozen in time. They can be developed and tailored to fit changes in the law and new offences. There is no doubt that Parliament can redefine the meaning of 'excuse' for example by expanding it to provide new excuses or excuses specific to particular offence, or by narrowing it to include only certain excuses."

The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required. The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.",The plaintiffs sought damages from the defendants for breach of contract dated January 1997 and with reference to the contract between the defendants and the Independent Truckers Association.

When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application. Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart. It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart. The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart. HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed. The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart.

However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias.

He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","HELD: Appeal allowed.

The respondent is 22 years old. He suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse/dependence disorder. He has been diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded.

The defence had already indicated that issues around s8 and s9 of the charter would be raised at trial. HELD: The Court held that on motions of this kind, the Court ought to guard against the pursuit of what have been termed 'fishing expeditions'—speculative quests for information without any real expectation about the outcome of the quest or its relevance to the case. To pursue the fishing analogy so often used in the authorities the court must guard against what are termed'speculatively quest for information' without a real expectation of the outcome or relevance of the case or the quest. Here, however, the defence has already indicated they will raise the Charter issues at trial and the Crown shall make timely disclosure of the information. Defence now wants further disclosure for the purposes of preparing and pursuing inquiry into those important issues. The Crown shall also make timely disclosures of: (a) The number of stops of out-of-province vehicles made by Constable Chornecki in each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004; (b) The reason for each stop in the first place; (c) How many of those stops resulted in a search for contraband, including narcotics; (d) Specifics of any other grounds for those searches that were applied and how many times; (e) On how many occasions did the searches result in the finding of contraband; (f) The names of the drivers stopped be disclosed and that the actual notes of the officer to be reproduced."
5_2008skca56.txt,"The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","The accused was convicted of sexually assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and also assaulting her, using a weapon, to wit a baseball bat. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appealed both conviction and sentence. HELD: The appeal against conviction was dismissed. 1)The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on a sentence appeal. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence, this case is factually distinct from the case at bar. 2)The trial judge did address the issue of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony, explained their significance and related them to the position of the defence. The charge that followed 2 days later was entirely correct to the circumstances of this case. The trial judge stressed the reasonable doubt standard and concluded his charge with the direction consistent with R. v. W.(D.)."

M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code. After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions.

8_2006skca58.txt,"All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement. They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause. It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement. However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole. Accordingly, the voting agreement is not caught by subsection 14.01.","All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement.

The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act. HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant. The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing. Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing.","FIAT.

The issue was whether the claim was a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act and if so, whether the affidavit of Shirley Scott, filed in support of the issuance of both of the garnishee summons, complies with s.3(2) of that Act. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's claim discloses a prima facie claim for debt or liquidated damage pursuant to the Act. 2) Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0% per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement of September 10, 2001. 3) The contents of the affidavit are severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of the indebtedness owing on the judgment, the debt or the liquidation demand as the case may be.  4) The Court was concerned that the content of a four-page invoice attached to the affidavit as Exhibit C, supposedly attached to a copy of the operating agreement dated October 31, 2005, was not in line with the text of the original affidavit filed by the applicant.  5) It is trite law that plaintiff has a statutory right to garnish the defendant’s funds before the validity of the claim has been determined if the action is for a debt or a demand.

She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","HELD: The Court found that the parties were not satisfied that the respondent's use of marijuana was benign and without a potential risk to his children. The respondent requested that all restrictions on his transport of the children be removed including the provision restricting his marijuana use to eight hours prior to his driving, and that the remaining provisions of the Varied Corollary Relief Judgment continue in effect and that she receive a cost award."
8_1995canlii5717.txt,"The Respondent and the Applicant had a violent argument after which the Applicant and the child left the matrimonial home and moved to Transition House. The Applicant sought and obtained an emergency intervention order under The Victims of Domestic Violence Act from a Justice of the Peace giving her exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home and restraining her husband from having any contact with her or their daughter during the currency of the order. This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review. The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section. The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered. HELD: Order vacated.  1)An emergency intervention order is granted by a Justice of the Peace under s.3 of the Act without notice to the person whose conduct it restrains and without any representations from that person or on that person's behalf. It is an extraordinary remedy to be granted only where serious and urgent circumstances indicate a need for prompt action to protect the victim. 2)Absent such urgency, the application should be one for a 'victim's assistance order' brought to a Queen's Bench Judge in Chambers under s.7 in accordance with The Queen's Bench Rules. 3)In this case the domestic violence complained of occurred on January 28. There was no evidence that on February 1, 1995, Dolgopol was at risk of immediate harm. There was by then no element of urgency and the application for relief should have awaited the regular Queen's Bench Family Law Division chamber sittings.  4)The Court commented that it was unclear whether this rehearing was to proceed de novo or as a review but determined that the order should not stand in any event and therefore terminated it forthwith.","A justice of the peace made an order granting Dolgopol exclusive occupation of the family residence and restraining him from having contact with his wife or daughter during the course of the order.

The Bond contained a provision limiting the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to any claimant not having a contract directly with the principal. Dismissing the action with costs, that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier. With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work. As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff. Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond.","After a subcontractor failed to complete its contract work, a supplier of materials to the sub-contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a Labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub contractor.

Based on the original contract between the parties and ongoing payments, it is not possible on the evidence to say with any certainty why Gardon Securities did not receive such an alarm generated by the rising of the freezer temperature at Sturgis Meats.

e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent seeks to vary two orders issued in 1998 and 2001. He wants to expunge the arrears in respect of each and also seeks a declaration that their three children are no longer children of the marriage. HELD: 1) The application was dismissed. The court found that the respondent did not have the ability to pay child support because he was expected to maximize his earning capacity but simply chose not to.  2) The respondent had not been complying with any of the many support orders issued over the last 25 years and did not want the issue of child support to interfere with his plans. 3) The petitioner had struggled for 25 years to obtain child and spousal support. She was not very successful. He was adamant that he should not pay more than $2,000 per month. He knew that he could have taken employment that paid him at least $110,000 a year. Now, some 12 years later, he argues that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income. The fact remains that rather than seek employment that could pay him handsomely, he chose to flail away in private practice for years and earn much less than he otherwise would have. 4) The Court found that although the respondent was not being paid, his child support obligations should not be based on his income over the years. He did not accept the assertion that he was incapable of paying child support. 5) There was no undue hardship to either party. The respondent was ordered to pay $1,683 in monthly child support in the amount of $183,746.  6) The court ordered that he pay $9,562 under the March 7, 2001 order. The Court ordered that the petitioner make monthly payments on the $106,000 of debt that remains from that which she borrowed to support the herself and the children during the many periods of time that he stopped paying support. 7) The amount owed by the respondent to the petitioner was $58,000 after paying his living expenses in 2011. It is repugnant to even suggest that reducing child support should be done by means of garnishment or the interception of federal government monies."
e_2009nssc204.txt,"An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment. The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at St. Francis Xavier University when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment.

HELD: The application was dismissed. A reasonable and fit party and party level of costs is $5,000 plus disbursement of $510. The defendant is entitled to judgment for costs. 1)The defendant made an offer of settlement in the amount of $1,000 inclusive of costs which take to be an attempt to have the action simply go away due to the heavy costs of litigation. The sale price of the property which was approximately $2,000,000 was not, in my view, the appropriate amount involved and it was very difficult and in fact, impossible for me to really get a handle on what amount of loss of profits was being pursued or to what extent the defendants were monetarily at risk. 2)There was no tariff that provided direction with regard to the determination of costs in Chambers' applications. While time sheets, time sheets and time sheets can be very helpful in determining party costs, the level of solicitors' fees in this application is not very useful in measuring an amount that is just and appropriate."

Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace. HELD: The Crown failed to provide proper disclosure to defence counsel, the non-disclosure had an adverse effect of the accused's ability to make full answer in defence and the appropriate remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call Ace as a witness.","The accused was charged with break and enters of homes. The Crown advised the court of its intention to call a witness to the witness box.

The defence argued that if the Crown informed the court that it was going to call the witness, the accused would not be able to cross-examine the witness effectively or at all. HELD: 1)A stay of proceedings is out of the question. The accused's right to full answer and defence has been prejudiced only with respect to the cross-examination of the witness. 2)The Crown's failure to disclose its intent to call this witness has prejudiced or had an adverse effect on the accused's ability to make full answer. 3)The defence has met this test. 4)The prejudice to the accused’s right to make complete answer, defence flows from not being told that Ace Carlos Whitecap would be a Crown witness. 5)The accused is entitled to prepare his defence on the basis of the witnesses the Crown is actually calling. Defence has met the test. Arguments could have been made for other counsel to take over the entire defence or, at the very least, sit in during the trial in order to be effective. 6)The only remedy is to refuse to allow the Crown to call. The court must take into account all aspects of the failure to make fully disclosure. This includes the nature of the charge, delay, adjournments to date and at who's request, the nature and nature of evidence not disclosed and the Crown's explanation for the omission. The point in time at which failure to disclosure occurs will impact on the relief. If at the beginning of trial, an adjournment is ordered, defence counsel would have had to sit through the entire Crown case. That lawyer should have taken over the whole Crown case entirely to be sure to protect the interests of both Mr. Whitecap and Mr. Lathlin.

The defendants were granted leave to appeal only that portion of the certification order that pertained to the cause of action relating to alleged breaches of the Consumer Protection Act, S.S. 1996, c. C-30.1 (the CPA). All other aspects of the leave application, including that relating to the breach of duty of care cause, were dismissed. The situation now exists that the class action will definitely advance although, until after the appeal concerning the CPA cause is finally determined, it is not known whether the class actions will proceed on the basis of one cause or two. HELD: 1) Rule 15 of the Court's Appeal Rules states that unless otherwise ordered by judge, the service and filing of notice of appeal stays the execution of any other judgment or order pending the disposition of the appeal. Where there is an appeal pending on only one aspect of a certification order, the entire matter may be stayed. 2) Rule 9 of the Rules states: 15(1) Rule 8 of The Rules states, in part, that a judge may order an application for stay of proceedings pending a disposition of an appeal.  3) Rule 7 of the rules states that if a judge is ordered to lift the stay on an aspect of certification, it may be appropriate to do so."

The respondent’s solicitors filed the certificate of pending litigation after his death. The appellant transferred the land subject to the certificate of pending litigation into her name only and entered into an agreement to sell the land, which could not proceed with the certificate of pending litigation. HELD: The appeal was of sufficient merit and it was not prima facie frivolous or vexatious. The appeal, however, was not found to be of sufficient importance to the practice of law or the Court of Queen’s Bench to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal.

The complainant sustained a nasal fracture. The accused did not deny that he was hurt but argued self-defence. The court found that the blows were not intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm but rather to cause bodily harm. The injuries were caused by force applied intentionally and directly by the accused. The Court found that there were too many variables and probabilities for the accused to rely on the Criminal Code s.34.
e_2012skpc161.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","The accused pleaded guilty to aggravated assault thereby endangering the victim contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that he report to his youth worker. HELD: A sentence of 24 months to be followed by a period of probation with credit for 6 months for pre-sentence detention and 6 months of community supervision. The accused will be permanently disabled as a result of the assault. Mitigating is the early guilty plea, thereby saving the complainant the additional anguish of having to testify at a trial. The young person was cooperative with police and provided a statement. While in detention, he has done reasonably well. The Court has little confidence that this young person would successfully comply with the conditions set out in s. 42(9)."
9_2000skca87.txt,"An appeal under s.33.1 of the Municipal Board Act from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board, one in a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor (MAF) to assessments for municipal tax purposes. In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision. The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case. The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.  4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided.","This appeal is from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board. It is one of a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor to assessments for municipal tax purposes. HELD: The appeal is allowed on the same basis in respect of these grounds of appeal. 1)The issues raised by the appellant in this case respecting the MAF to be used in calculating the assessed value of Market Mall are exactly the same as the issues raised and dealt with in another judgment, issued concurrently with this one. 2)Market Mall was built in 1966 and underwent expansions in 1979, 1982, 1987 and 1992. The assessor calculated MAF of 0.94 for the mall. If it had been grouped with all other commercial retail buildings in its commercial building neighbourhood, its MAF would have been 0.65.  3)The decision was arrived at not as a result of any wrong interpretation of the manual, but rather from the appellant's failure to establish to the satisfaction of the committee the facts on which it based its case.  4)The court was not satisfied that the appellant had established that there was any excess of a non-revenue producing common area, or any accepted standard as to ratio of revenue to non-venue producing areas, nor was it satisfied that any lack of economic utility in the common areas or underground parkade was in the category of abnormal functional obsolescence for the improvement.  5)The appellant only raised two issues: 1)Did the Assessor err in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the assessment manual in determining the market adjustment factors for the Appellants' properties by using a single sale to calculate the market adjust factor?  2)Creating as a commercial building a grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire City of Saskatoon was not the ground for the decision. The same reasoning applied in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon. Exactly the same reasoning applies here."
1994canlii5095.txt,"The Director of Labour Standards issued a certificate against the City of Regina certifying that it owed a transit employee $318.41 in wages for hours worked in weeks containing a statutory holiday in excess of 32 hours as provided in the Labour Standards Act. The City applied for a review. HELD: The City's application was allowed. Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question. Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act.","The City brought an application to review a certificate issued pursuant to s. 60 of the Labour Standards Act declaring that the City of Regina (the ""City"") owed its transit employee $511.08 in wages. The Director filed a March 8, 1994, letter reducing the assessment to $318.41 (including annual holiday pay). The City brought this application to the Court of Appeal on the ground that by ss. 10(1) and 6(2) of the Act, an employer is required to pay an employee at the rate of time and one-half for every hour worked in excess of 32 hours in any week containing a public holiday. At the hearing, the Director argued that from April 1990 to January 1994, there were five weeks in which the City paid the employee 40 hours but was not paid overtime for the eight excess hours. HELD: 1)The provisions of the agreement should govern, and not those of, the Act. 2)The City filed various documents, including copies of the collective bargaining agreement it has with the Amalgamated Transit Union, Local #588, which covers Morgan's employment with the City, and asked me to compare the agreement's holiday pay with the Act's. 3)The documents satisfy the Director that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement the city paid the transit employee 87 hours of pay in excess and 1.4 hours of overtime for each of the specific weeks questioned by the Director. 4)The agreement's provisions governing pay for holidays are more favourable than those in the Act and the overtime arises only because there is a holiday in the week."
6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT: The applicants, who are charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana, plead not guilty to the charges. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance and a section 487.01(4) 9 day video surveillance authorization for the residence of the applicant Derksen authorizing the observance of a marijuana grow operation. The applicants seek to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrant excluded from trial, and state it is also an appropriate case to direct a stay of proceedings on all charges against both applicants. HELD: The application for leave to cross-examine is granted when the trial judge is satisfied that the information obtained from the electronic surveillance was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant and the subsequent search warrant both of these warrants should also be set aside on the basis they are derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful. Preliminary Inquiry Evidence: The Crown relied on the British Columbia Court of Appeal decision of R. v. West (1998), 1997 CanLII 3792 (BC CA), 12 C.R. (5th) 106. The Court noted that the 1993 amendments to s. 187 of the Code were no reason to grant leave to allow cross-examination of police witnesses with respect to an authorization of electronic surveillance using the same criteria set out by Sopinka J. in R. vs. Garofoli (1990), 60 C.D. (3d) 161 (S.C.C.) at p. 198. The court found that the police did not try any investigative procedures available to them before applying for the authorization and as the matter was not urgent s. 186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with."

These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant. The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years. The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay. After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here. On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice. There is a significant documentary record of the transactions. The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner. The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time. While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice. Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","The plaintiffs filed an Originating Notice and Statement of Claim in 2000 alleging that the defendant RBC caused them to suffer losses on investments.

The relief sought regarding disclosure had been abandoned by the applicant. The applicant argued that the fundamental questions to be addressed revolved around issues of statutory interpretation that must be resolved on a standard of correctness and the alternative remedies were not adequate. The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member.

There were no 'special circumstances' upon which the court should exercise its discretion to determine the merits of the application.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of prohibition to prevent the respondent hearing officer from proceeding with the hearing into the conduct of the applicant pursuant to discipline charges brought against him by the respondent police chief. HELD: 1) The fundamental questions to be addressed in this case revolve around issues of statutory interpretation that must be resolved on a standard of correctness. The alternative remedies were not adequate. 2) The applicant took objection to the prosecutor's request to amend the Form notice of the discipline offence with which he was charged and with the failure by the Chief of the Police to provide notice to Cst. Young of the Discipline proceedings as required by the Act. 3) The hearing officer held that s. 42 of the Act provides complete discretion to the chief of the police to amend charges without the need to obtain leave to do so from the hearing officer or, in the alternative, that the Hearing Officer had the discretion to grant leave to amend and leave was granted. 4) In Selinger v. Ontario Human Rights Commission (1971), no proceedings to prosecute charge shall be commenced after the expiry of six months from the day on which the alleged charge should have been discovered. The applicant argued the Court should decline to hear judicial review applications of interim decisions in discipline hearings. 5) There was no evidence that the applicant's right to an appeal to the senate committee constituted an adequate alternative remedy and even better remedy than recourse to the courts by way of prerogative writs. 6) The alternative remedy was not adequate in the view of the appellant. 7) The court reviewed the factors to be considered in determining whether or not an alternative remedy should be available. 8) The Court reviewed the procedure on the appeal, the composition of the Senate committee, its powers and the manner in which they were exercised by body which was not a professional court of appeal and was not bound to act exactly as one nor likely to advise the applicant. 9) In Bayne v. University of Saskatchewan (1979) W.W.R. 676 (SCC), the doctrine of the 'adequate alternative remedy' as bar to judicial review was held to constitute a bar because judicial review is discretionary remedy. The Court considered the factors set out in Selinger and set out the test to be applied in making the determination of whether/and only if the applicant applies for a writ of prohibition. The court considered the following factors:  1) the applicant had no jurisdiction over roads and had lost jurisdiction by not acting within a statutory period.  2) there was no"

Although both she and her husband had good incomes, it would still take several more years to discharge the loans without prejudicing her family's reasonably frugal lifestyle. Relief granted; to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties. The bankrupt had acted in good faith and had been unable to service the loans in the early years when she did not have permanent employment. Compromising the debt and requiring her to only pay half of it was not an available option.","The Bankrupt, who had outstanding student loans of about $39,000 applied for relief under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. HELD: To discharge the loans would require several years on top of the already 13 years she has been burdened with them. Relief was granted. 1)If I could compromise the debt, I would have no difficulty in requiring her to pay a significant portion of the debt (say half of it) or to expect them to pay in a shorter period of time. This would be a continuation of financial difficulty which prevented her from paying the loans. 2)This was an application by the bankrupt for an order that Paragraph 178 (1)(g) does not apply to her student loans."
2009skqb445.txt,"The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances. The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","The accused is facing a 24-count indictment generally associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances and matters ancillary thereto. This motion, under ss.7, 11(d) and 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, is for an order that the accused be provided with full disclosure in a usable format. The issue relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, 'the usable format' and whether the notes of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence."

The Court was not satisfied that the court had accurate information as to the applicant's present income so as to be satisfied there was a substantial change in circumstance such as variation.

2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. Defence counsel submitted that the accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer. The accused then swung the weapon at the officer, coming so close to the officer that it caused him to back away and pull his sidearm. The weapon was of such a size that, as the court noted when giving the decision after trial, there was no doubt that if struck in the head with this object, it could cause serious damage."
e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10 (b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. The only evidence led in the voir dire at the trial was that of the police officer who stopped the respondent in a routine traffic stop of vehicles entering the city from the east. After the police stopped the appellant in a motor vehicle stop of vehicle entering the east, the appellant attempted to telephone a lawyer but was unsuccessful. The police officer advised the appellant that he had the right to retain counsel, could contact any lawyer he wished, and could apply for legal assistance without charge. The appellant refused to provide the lawyer and instead requested that the police inform him of the existence and availability of the applicable systems of duty counsel and Legal Aid in that jurisdiction. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be opened nor to participate in any potentially incriminating process until he has had that reasonable opportunity to contact counsel. The Crown argues that the learned judge erred in his application of Prosper to the case before him, not only because of the conclusion he reached on the evidence but on the interpretation of Prosper with respect to the facts at hand. The holding-off requirement applies to situations where a detainee has asserted his right to counsel and has been reasonably diligent in exercising it, yet has been unable to reach a lawyer because duty counsel is unavailable at the time of detention, courts must ensure that the Charter rights are not too easily waived. An additional informational obligation on police will be triggered once a detainee indicates that he or she has changed his mind and no longer wants legal advice. At this point, police are required to tell the detainee of his or her right to reasonable opportunity and of the obligation on the part of police during this time to refrain from having them participate in the process that would incriminate him. This additional informational requirement on police ensures that the evidence may cease to be available as result of a long delay is factor to be considered."

A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.","HELD: The issue was: Does the registered owner of a vehicle have the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it?  1)The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable as against the conflicting claim of Ms. Clayton.  2)There is no title registry of vehicles in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance (SGI). Counsel for the applicant asserts that this registration is only for insurance purposes but such is not the historical fact. Lenders, police officers and the world at large rely upon that certificate. If such certificate were obtained by the legislature, it would create some unfairness as price for certainty."

The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions.

With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children.

The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it.

It was at that time that Orion Morgan advised counsel for the plaintiffs and the Court that his corporation had recently been dissolved. The plaintiffs sought to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case.

6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff purchased a home in 1998. She engaged the services of the defendant, Cecilia Mui, realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After a lengthy search house was purchased the following year. It was owned by the defendants, Edward and Verl Karpinski. Their realtor was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. HELD: The plaintiff sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She says that Ms. Mui and her company fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. She also alleges aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against the husband and wife, asserting that their acts and omissions exacerbated her distress.  1) The house did not meet the plaintiff’s expectations. The property was too expensive for the plaintiff to afford. She was unable to obtain a mortgage on it. 2) The realtor and her husband were liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the parties. 3) The plaintiff did not know that the house had been moved, nor was she aware that the rural municipality did not do any inspections of moved or newly constructed residences. She had no idea that the property was being sold. She simply wanted to see what property of this value would look like. She did not have the means to do so.  4) There was no discussion about home inspection. The evidence indicated that the realtor had not been properly trained in the construction of the house and that the husband had misrepresented certain facts to the plaintiff. The husband had been in the plumbing and heating business for more than 35 years and had no particular expertise or knowledge about construction. The wife had no interest in purchasing a house and was not able to afford one. She wanted to buy one that would not require extensive renovations or repairs and that would be good for 50 years.  5) The husband was not a party to the action. He was hired as a consultant. He did not provide the wife with a copy of the building permit.  6) The wife did not want to buy a house that was not within her means. She felt that she could not realistically afford to buy it. She sued the husband for damages against him and his company.  7) The court found that the wife was entitled to damages against both parties for negligence and for misrepresentation."

c_1999skqb60.txt,"The plaintiff lawyer commenced an action for fees and disbursements in the amount of $4,647.85. The proposed garnishee, SPMC, paid $337.46 into court and brought an application for an order pursuant to Rules 411 and 415(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. An order that any further amounts due and owing from SPMC to the company be paid into court to be disposed as directed by the court was granted with taxed costs to SPMC. Labour Standards filed notice of potential wage claims. The plaintiff obtained default judgment and made an ex parte application for payment out of the monies paid into court by SPMC. HELD: The applicant/plaintiff was to be paid all monies paid into court by SPMC with respect to the two files together with accrued interest less the amount previously paid out. The claim by the Minister of Labour was dismissed. Although the monies paid into court according to the decision in Polyco Window Manufacturing Ltd v. Prudential Assurance Co create a fund from which creditors must be paid, the claim by the Minister of Labour as of the date of the application was not a proven claim. No certificate had been issued and no judgment had been entered as of that date. A judgment had been filed by the plaintiff. He was the only party entitled to the monies.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant for fees and disbursements in the amount of $4,647.85. On March 9, 1999, the plaintiff obtained a garnishee summons issued prior to judgment against the said defendant and served it on Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (SPMC). The plaintiff then made an ex parte application for payment out of the moneys which had been paid into court by SPMC.

He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company by Leo Larsen, its former President and Chief Executive Officer. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, first, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as in the ensuing months are either earned or should have earned in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum. The Crown Employment Contracts Act set aside the contractual provisions for payment on dismissal contained in all Crown contracts including those of a Crown corporation and directed instead that payment be determined in accordance with common law principle."
d_2006nsca124.txt,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The judge found that the warrant could have been issued had it been properly quashed, that the evidence obtained as a result of the search was wrongly excluded, and that the judge substituted her views for those of the issuing JP. The appeal court found that even had the warrant been quashed the police conduct did not justify excluding the evidence. Therefore, the result would not necessarily have been the same."

Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.",This was an application for an order for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment under the Civil Procedure Rules 31.01. The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle at the time of the accident and said in her affidavit that she was struck from behind by one of the defendants named in the action. The defendant argued there was a significant amount of other factors relating to the plaintiff's health. HELD: Judgment was entered against the defendant as to liability with damages to be assessed. 1)The plaintiff was making a significant claim yet when one listens to defendant's counsel and reads the material attached to the defendant's affidavit the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have enough care or control of his vehicle and consequently the collision occurred. 2)The defendant argued that there had to be an 'air of realty' to the claim. 3)The evidence submitted by the plaintiff submitted by way of her affidavits caused the court difficulty in determining the amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at largely upon credibility and medical evidence at trial. The bald statement in the pleadings does not disclose the existence of an actual or probable defence and cannot fend off an application.
e_2000skqb515.txt,"The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","The Crown applied pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act (CDSA) for an order forfeiting the Lincoln to Her Majesty in Right of Canada. The Crown argued that s.19(3) contravenes the guarantees contained in s.11(d) and s.12 of the Charter. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It is not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s 19(3), however, because Crown counsel consented to Brooks' submission being viewed as an application by her for relief from forfeiture pursuant to S.20. 2)The Court must first consider the gravity of the offence, the personal characteristics of the offender and the nature of their property interest."
d_2005nsca104.txt,"The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday. He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","This was an appeal from an order made pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act requiring the appellant father to pay child support in the amount of $2,000. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellant father had not withdrawn and was unable to withdraw from his parent's charge at the time of the accident. He had made great strides but had not and will not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. 2)The evidence supported the appellant's finding that the appellant was not intending to work permanently but was taking a hiatus before continuing his education. 3)The order for support was not premised on James' continuing dependency as a result of his pursuit of post-secondary studies. It simply states that the dependency continues if the child is 'unable, by reason of illness, disability or other cause, to withdraw or provide himself with reasonable needs.' It is not an appropriate case for a time-limited order."
6_1990canlii4137.txt,"This was an application under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the two appellant university professors was invalid and denied the rights of the appellants as guaranteed under ss. 15(1) and (7) of the Charter, and an order for reinstatement and back pay. Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s.15(1), 24(1) and 52(1)(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the applicants' rights as guaranteed under the Charter and that the applicants be reinstated as full-time members of the Faculty of the respondent immediately and that pay to the applicants as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest, and costs of the proceeding. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent is a wholly independent institution of post-secondary education which manages, administers and controls its property, revenue, business and affairs through its Board of Governors and administration department. 2)There is no evidence of governmental control that could be regarded as an exercise of government power sufficient to bring the respondent within the application of the charter. In cases involving arrests, detentions, searches and the like, to apply the Charter to purely private action would be tantamount to setting up an alternative tort system. In the area of private discrimination, an entirely new system of civil liability in competition with the dispute resolution mechanisms of the Canadian Human Rights Act would be established. 3)The applicant's contention that this creates the degree of government control to warrant the application is untenable. The applicant is only bringing employees who are not in the public service within the definitions required to be under that pension plan and such 'deeming' is only for the purposes of that Act. The respondent is not an arm of the government but rather is fully dependent institution of higher learning. 4)The collective agreement in effect in 1987 provided for the appointment of a full time member of the Board as a researcher in the Engineering Physics Department. His interest was in the field of acoustics. He attained the age of 65 on March 12, 1988. He requested reinstatement with back pay on the basis of his view of the normal retirement date and asserted right to non-discrimination on a specific salary, not at all comparable to his regular salary. He retired in September 1990. 5)The only real relationship between the respondent and the Faculty Association was that the collective agreement was a voluntary one. The collective agreement did not have to conform to the provisions of the Public Service Superannuation Act."

This designation was made pursuant to Rule 7 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997, c.8.2. 2. Although the grandmother had a blood tie to the parties, it was clear that the relationship between her and the father had been ongoing for some time.

The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith.

c_2007nsca4.txt,"The appellants applied for leave to amend their notice of appeal in regard to an order requiring them to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications. The application was opposed, inter alia, on the basis that the allegations which underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the trial judge, were irrelevant on the application and were not ruled on by the trial judge. Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","The appellants apply for leave to amend their notice of appeal. Leave is required because the notice was filed more than 20 days ago: Rule 62.04(4). The application is opposed by the respondent 2301072 Nova Scotia Limited and the intervenor. Leave to amend the notice is granted. The appellants wish to add a ground of appeal that the respondent, the plaintiff in the main action, is not a 'lawful plaintiff' and, therefore, not entitled to security for costs.

4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to distribution of child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years, as well as the additional provisions of s. 487.051 of the Code. The court found that the defendant had no criminal record and was now serving the useful social purpose of looking after his ailing mother who lives on an isolated acreage and who will be punished if he is incarcerated. The defendant had abided by his release conditions over the past two and half years, had no previous criminal record, and had now served a useful social role of looking care for his mother who was also a victim of the offence. A conditional sentence would not be a fit sentence as it would not deter others who might be inclined to engage in the activity of distributing child pornography. A sentence of 15 months incarceration would not exceed 2 years, and the defendant would not endanger the community if one were imposed."
7_2011skpc143.txt,"The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals. The issue was whether the claims should be issued. HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","HELD: The Court declined to issue summonses as requested. The Court found that the issues raised by these claims were declaratory in nature and outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court and that litigation, in my view, must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench, by either issuing a new claim or by way of enforcement proceedings of the claim upon which the agreement referenced above was made."
2_1999canlii12669.txt,"The respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support. The parties were married in January 1991 with three children and ceased to cohabit in December of 1996. The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT. An application for interim spousal support.

The parties were married in 1981 and ceased to cohabit in 1996. The petitioner qualified for disability pension under the Canada Pension Plan by reason of his mental disability. This provided his basic income of $580. The balance of $6,000 should be paid to the respondent by monthly payments in the amount of $500.

The testator died in January 2015 and application for probate had not yet been made. The deceased’s will had bequeathed all her property to her husband, Michael Reiter, who died in October 2015. The respondents were named executors of his estate. A simultaneous application had been brought by the same applicant to remove the respondents as executors of his estate (see: 2016 SKQB 15). The applicant had failed to serve the respondents with notice of this application or the alternate executor and beneficiaries named in the will. In addition, the applicant had misunderstood that she could rely upon evidence filed in another action that was also before the court in this application. HELD: The application was adjourned. The applicant was instructed to serve notice of the application and the adjournment on the alternate executor and the named beneficiaries.

2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The court found that the relationship between the parties was not in the best interests of the petitioner. 2) The petitioner had demonstrated that he was a person of sufficient interest with respect to his daughter. The relationship spanned five years and included periods of intermittent interruptions. 3) The respondent did not need to establish that he falls within the category of persons having a'sufficient interest' to bring this application. 4) The Court found that because the petitioner was a'step-parent' to the petitioner, he did not have to establish he fell within the categories having a sufficient interest under s. of the Act. 5) The child had a relationship with her biological father, who had been convicted of assaulting her and threatening her mother with a knife. 6) There was no evidence at trial as to whether the petitioner had any financial support from the respondent."
e_2011skqb444.txt,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","The accused is charged with aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident in the maximum security unit of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary. The accused and two alleged victims were inmates at the prison and were being held on a range designated for gang members. Given that the incident was captured by security videos, there is no doubt as to what happened. The issues raised by the accused pertain to how his actions ought to be characterized. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both charges. 1)The accused's actions against the victims were done in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. The Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused and the alleged victim were involved in a violent altercation that took place in the Maximum Security Unit of the SPC. 2)The Crown was entitled to call recognition evidence in accordance with the principles set out in R. v. Leaney, [1996] S.C.R. 321 (Alta. C.A.]. The Crown must also establish the mental element. In this case, the accused inflicted injuries to the victim that fit within the category of an aggravated assault. It is not legally necessary to establish the identity of the accused. The terms “aiding” and “abetting” have similar meanings. The term 'abet’ under s. 21(1)(b) includes encouraging, instigating, promoting or procuring the crime to be committed. The requirement of an objective analysis ensures that the criminal law encourages reasonable and responsible behaviour. The concept of “parties to the offence” is conceptually possible to be liable as both a joint principal offender and as a secondary offender. Had not found the accused to be “joint principal offender”, would have found him to be an “aider” pursuant to ss.21(1(b) and ss.34(3). The terms 'aiding, 'abetting' and 'insulting' have similar concepts. In Pétel, 1994 CanLII 133 (SCC), [1994] SCC, [1997] SC. R. 825, the Supreme Court adopted the dissenting opinion of the Alberta Court of Appeal in the decision of R. vs. Godin.

The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused. The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,"The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to provide forthwith a sample of his breath as in the opinion of Cst. Rozario. The accused chose not to disclose in his disclosure information the name of the 'ride along' nor even that there was a ride along. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The officer was not intentionally trying to avoid providing an adequate sample. He was attempting to supply sample as directed by the officer. The officer's lack of cander in giving his evidence in this regard has raised doubts in my mind as to his forthrightness in respect to other important details in this matter.  2)Where there is a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused, the Court accepts the evidence of the accused."

The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).","The appellant, convicted of break, enter and theft, committed the offence of theft of a 1994 Chev Blazer contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.

3_2003skqb93.txt,"The company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by its creditor pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide. He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status. HELD: The Proposal was accepted.  1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA. The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation. Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.  3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","W.R.T. Equipment applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by it to its creditor (the 'Trustee') pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. At the December meeting of creditors, 93 percent of the creditors who had proven claims voted in favour of accepting the proposal. At January 13, 2003 the Trustee made an application to the Registrar for Court approval of the applicant's Proposal. Notice of Objection to this application was filed on behalf of an unsecured creditor who was a former 28-year employee of the Company. The Trustee was bound by the terms of collective bargaining agreement applicable to certain of its production employees including Mr. Tilk. At that December meeting approximately 89 percent of creditors voted for the Proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims and 1 opposed it. HELD: The Proposal was accepted. Taking into account all of the interests the Court concluded, in the circumstances reviewed and for the reasons outlined in this judgment, that the proposal presented by W.R.'T. does meet the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The 15 employees in the same position voted in favor of the proposal, 2 opposed it, 2 abstained from filing proofs, 1 opposed the proposal and 1 opposing the amendment. The Court was much in sympathy with the concerns which the applicant has raised by his objection and the submissions made on his behalf at the hearing of this application. Absent the application of the provisions of the BIA to an employer it is clear that an employer's indebtedness to an employee pension plan does give the pensioners preferred creditor status by virtue of s. 43(3) of The Pension Benefits Act, 1992. Accordingly the proposed Proposal is accepted and the draft order filed may issue including the amendment to para. 9.1. The court will refuse to refuse to approve the proposal whenever it is established that the debtor has committed any one of the offences mentioned in sections 198 to 200."

The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity. He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown.","This was an application for leave to appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court of Canada dismissing an appeal from the appellant's conviction under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code.

The appellant testified that he had consumed five pints of beer during the course of the afternoon, the last shortly before being stopped by the police. In cross-examination the expert was asked to relate the readings shown by the tests to the alcohol consumed by the appellant. He stated that the readings were not consistent with the evidence of consumption given by the accused. The trial judge concluded that the appellant had not raised a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The evidentiary burden was stated to be beyond reasonable doubt. While the trial judge may have been referring to the burden of proof, he went further and stated that he did not raise a credible doubt. With respect that was a fundamental error of law and the Crown cannot rely on the presumption of accuracy. 2)The appellant's reading at the time of the driving, 1650 hours, was over point zero eight."
c_2009skpc31.txt,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of the Forest Resources Management Act. The defendant was the President and sole Director of the company. The company assembles log home packages in the Weyakwin district north of Prince Albert. These packages are sold to customers across Canada and around the world. The wood is harvested from Provincial Crown lands. The logs are then processed for inclusion in the log home package. The Crown alleges that the defendant took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the Crown requires such a licence. HELD: 1) Given the evidence presented that the steps taken by the defendant, which included cutting the logs were specifically taken to prepare them for the log market, the Crown's interpretation would create an absurdity. 2) The defendant did not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence issued by the Ministry of Environment pursuant to the FMPA. Given this definition it is not difficult to find based on the evidence that the step for manufacturing has already taken place. The steps may not be significant but the process utilized by the corporation is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. 3) The Crown's position creates an absurdity in that it would require any manufacturer, at any point in the market chain, to obtain a processing licence for any processing of product that had as its point of origin, Crown Forest Land. 4) The court was able to find the defendant guilty of violating the terms of the Act."

Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven. The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo. The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes. The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant. Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province. There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy.

The appellant was aware of the allegations and was aware that the Stratton Inquiry and the findings of that Inquiry had been conducted. The investigation material accumulated by both the IIU and the VIU referred to the former residents of the institutions who complained of physical and/or sexual abuse as either 'victims' or'survivors' and the type and frequency of the abuse complained of were identical in many cases and similar, but not identical, in other cases.

b_2013skqb407.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the cause of the damage was high humidity in the building caused by water leaking into it from the roof. The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800. Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836. The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500.","The plaintiff landlord claims damages against its tenant, the defendant, asserting negligence by failing to clean, wax and polish the vinyl tile floor in the building, thereby permitting moisture to penetrate between and underneath the tiles resulting in losses to the tenant's restaurant. The tenant claims damages for economic interference, alleging the landlord interfered with the sale of its restaurant. HELD: The damage to the floor is $22,281 and the tenant is contributorily negligent to the extent of 25% of the damage. The evidence does show that a part of the moisture entering into the subfloor was due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor. Leaking of water through the ceiling onto the floor did necessitate closure of the restaurant, causing reduction of business from customers who could reasonably be expected to be put off by the unsightly ceiling and floor tiles, and the catchment of the dripping water. Although the evidence shows that the restaurant was closed for several days even though daily overhead costs of $1,600 continued, no evidence was offered as to the landlord's negligence."

The Hearing Notice particularizes the factual allegations and is specific as to time and their nature. 2)The only matter previously considered by the discipline committee dealt with whether there was any professional misconduct established arising out of criminal convictions for illegal picketing prior to the applicant becoming a member of SALPN. 3)The Act provides an adequate alternate remedy, which should be pursued.

The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt. His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","FIAT. The defendant represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation (SCIC). The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed resulted from the actions of SCIC. The plaintiff's officer was employed by the farmers on contingency basis, the understanding being that the clients would pay the defendant's disbursements in any event. HELD: The applicant will have payment for the amount of its claim, interest as provided for in the undertaking and costs of the action. The only conclusion that can be drawn from the facts is that the respondent guaranteed the payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions."
b_1995canlii4505.txt,"The 46-year-old male plaintiff suffered damage to his knee, left ear and exacerbation of a back problem when his vehicle was struck by the defendant's vehicle. Finding the defendant solely at fault, that evidence from the accident reconstruction as to the angle of impact supported a conclusion the defendant was travelling faster than she realized and was inattentive. Damages were set as follows: impairment to hearing in left ear assessed at $8500, damage to left knee assessed at $2500. Exacerbation of a pre-existing back condition which produced consequences in the severe range was assessed at $31,500.","HELD: The onus was on the defendant to establish negligence on the plaintiff. The plaintiff's inattention rendered her solely responsible for the accident, and she was not justified in entering the lane of opposing traffic. The defendant suffered a concussion, hearing loss in his left ear, neck injury, injury to his lower back and knee which hit the dashboard. There was no evidence of a trigger point. The evidence was that the defendant had been driving erratically when he first observed the plaintiff's vehicle approaching from the left and then turned his wheel to the right in an attempt to avoid the oncoming vehicle. The collision occurred at approximately 1:30 a.m. with no interference in visibility, clear, bright, sunny day with no precipitation.  1) The defendant was found to have been travelling erratically at a high rate of speed when the accident occurred. He was not in his lane when the collision occurred. 2) The court was unable to conclude the defendant's negligence. It was concluded that the plaintiff had not been properly trained in the area of the accident and that she had not followed the natural tendency of going into the curve close to the centre line. 3) The Court was not satisfied with the evidence as to the extent of the damage to the vehicles. The court could not conclude that there was any contributory negligence."

During his employment as professional truck driver, the accused had driven into construction zone on highway and hit another vehicle that had been stopped. The three teenage occupants of the vehicle were killed and flag person was severely injured as result of the collision. The accused was sure that he had not been asleep at the time of the accident but felt that he had not been paying attention. He had not noticed any of the signs posted at 100-metre intervals after the start of the construction zone 1.6 km south of the accident. The accused was 41 years of age. He had obtained his A-1 driver’s licence in 2009 and had clean driving abstract. He was married and had three children. He had recently been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. He expressed remorse to the victim’s families and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.| HELD: The accused was sentenced to three years in imprisonment on the first count and three years concurrent for the second and third counts, and one year concurrent to the other counts on the fourth count. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment. The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone. The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse. He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record. The accused was at low risk to re-offend.","The accused was charged with three counts of operating a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public and thereby causing the death of three young flag people. HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of both counts. 1)The accused had no previous driving record. He failed to recognize stopped vehicles in the active construction zone and to allow sufficient distance to bring his vehicle to a safe stop before colliding with the rear of the Cobalt.  2)The Court considered all of the purposes and principles of sentencing as contained in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code, including aggravating and mitigating factors and similar sentences imposed for individuals convicted of dangerous driving causing death and causing bodily harm. 3)The court found that there was no evidence that the defendant had ever travelled on Highway No. in the Province of Saskatchewan before May 3, 2015 and, in particular, had ever driven through the construction zone. He was convicted of driving with more than 80 mgs of alcohol in his blood pursuant to s. 253(b) of the Code of Canada. 4)The Crown did not take any position with regard to the length of driving prohibition or the driving abstract. The Court was satisfied that the Court had sufficiently heard from the victims."
b_1999canlii12533.txt,"The primary issue was the appropriate parenting arrangement for the two children. The 1997 interim order awarded joint custody with the primary residence with the mother and reasonable access to the father including alternating weekends, reasonable telephone access and equal sharing of holidays. The father initially failed to pay child support as ordered then paid $250 per month rather than the $424.72 ordered. The parties no longer communicated directly with each other except by e-mail so that there was a record. HELD: 1)It was in the best interests of the children that their primary residence be with their mother. She had demonstrated greater flexibility and sensitivity to their needs. The father was granted access two weekends out of every three and additional time as they may agree upon. Although both were very good parents the parties had not demonstrated an ability to co-parent effectively as illustrated by their communication problems. The father's access initially went beyond the minimum required by the interim order. He failed to make support payments as ordered. The father was to pay child support of $449. Pursuant to s.7 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines he was to pay 54% of the net cost of child care expenses incurred as a result of the mother's employment and for health related expenses in excess of $100 of the insurance reimbursement upon production of receipts.  2)The automobile constituted matrimonial property and was valued at $200. 3)Either could speak to costs.","The primary issue was the appropriate parenting arrangement for the petitioner and the respondent. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support of $449.00 per month. 2)The petitioner was prepared in the initial stages to be more flexible than the respondent and prepared to promote maximum contact. It was unfortunate that they could not demonstrate an ability to co-parent more effectively. The petitioner was to have reasonable telephone access with the children and access at other times. 3)The parties were to agree by June of each year on the division of matrimonial property. The respondent's access went beyond the minimum required by the interim order. When the petitioner requested weekend access, the respondent would agree only if the petitioner gave him more mid-week access in lieu. 4)Costs of child care were to be determined by the parties."
c_2011skqb100.txt,A judgment issued from the Court along with a writ of execution. The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT: ACS seeks an order from the Court requiring the legal office of Eggum, Abrametz and Eggum to produce to the sheriff of Prince Albert, the shares owned by Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co. Ltd., within seven days of service of the order compelling production of the shares. HELD: The claim for lien is not made out. 1) Given the totality of what is before me, the common opinion is that the solicitor may withhold it from all parties. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure of a piece of farm land. The sheriff has no greater right to refuse production of documents on which he has lien than his client would have if he had the documents in his possession. 3) The court has been thwarted. The solicitor's lien arises out of s. 66(3) of The Legal Profession Act, 1990, particularly ss. 17-17.2. Upon seizure, the sheriff has the power to sell the shares in order to collect the outstanding debt. 4) The solicitor has no rights greater than those of the client vis-à-vis the solicitor cannot be sustained."
c_2002nssc30.txt,"The borrower in a mortgage foreclosure action counterclaimed against the lender and joined the insurer of the mortgage and experts he had retained for advice in the development on the basis of negligent misrepresentation. During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate. No privilege was claimed during the discovery process. The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs. Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver. There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.","The plaintiff sought to insure the mortgage with Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) through its mortgage insurance program. The mortgage fell into arrears during construction of the apartment complex and Canada Life commenced this action. The plaintiff counterclaimed that Canada Life acted on appraisals negligently prepared, mishandled the advances on the mortgage and failed to abide by its contract with the defendant. The defendant argued that the documents sought, and indeed all of the defendant's evidence, ought to be excluded on the basis that it is subject to solicitor-client privilege. HELD: The plaintiff was granted leave to obtain the documents. The court found that the waiver may be reasonably inferred. In this factual situation, the plaintiff may not show that the defendant has waived his fiduciary duty by interposing the affirmative defense of good faith reliance on the government's regulations and communications."
b_2012skca3.txt,"The appellants appealed the order of a Queen's Bench chamber's judge striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim. HELD: The chamber's judge was in error in striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application. The Court of Appeal opted to deal with the merits of the application themselves, rather than remitting the matter back to Queen's Bench. While the allegation of fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, the pleading is nevertheless sufficient to answer the requirements of QB Rule 173. The appellants should have been given an opportunity to amend their pleadings. The appeal was allowed and the application to strike was dismissed without prejudice to respondent's right to seek further particulars.","Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] We have concluded that the chamber judge striking major portions of the statement of defence and counterclaim was made in error. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application brought by the respondent to strike the impugned portions of these pleadings. HELD: Appeal allowed. While fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, having regard for the constituent elements of the tort, the pleading was sufficient to answer to the requirements of Rule 173. The allegations of fraud were sufficient in the way of particulars of the alleged fraud. The pleading was insufficient to answer the requirement of Rule 149 but without at least giving the respondent the opportunity to amend its pleadings in these respects so as to be more specific, the allegations could fairly be struck out as not answering to Rule 149, albeit barely so perhaps."

Even if the respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, the appellant failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach. The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit. This loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did. As the trial judge found, the termination of the distributorship was unconnected to the respondent.","The respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, Belterra failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs, such costs to be taxed as usual on the basis of double column 5 of the Court of Appeal Tariff of costs and one for the appellant at its highest. There was no evidence that the respondent was unable to sell all of its existing inventory to its existing customers during the year, and no evidence of anything the respondent did or might have done in breach of his contract."

The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act.

The applicant asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent. The respondent argues that the provisions of the Planning and Development Act must, of necessity, be considered merged in conveyance. HELD: The court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the Court is not bound by the statutory requirement in exercising its power to make orders.  1) The applicant is a bona fide purchaser without notice of the Flads' interest and relying on the indefeasibility of his title. 2) When the error first came to light in 1995, the applicant, the School Division, was asking the court to lapse the caveat. The application in question was tantamount to a judicially ordered partition of land to avoid the effect of legislation. The Court was obliged to prevent such wholesale frustration of the legislature's objects. 3) The original transaction appeared to have been concluded in an effort to avoid compliance with subdivision regulations, rather it was made in the mistaken belief that an already subdivided parcel was being transferred. The agreement was concluded in 1996, conditional on subdivision approval, which the Court agreed to obtain at its own cost. 4) The Court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, and judge was empowered under s. 6 of the Act."

The petitioner had previously been ordered to pay $1,000 in costs to the respondent but instead paid the $1,000 directly into the child's credit card balance and there was no evidence that this was done by mutual agreement between the parties. The child was not performing well in her program with no explanation for her poor performance. HELD The burden is on the petitioner to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence. Although the child is a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act during the time she was attending classes, her expenses are excessive. The child provided no evidence to rebut the respondent's information that she did not attend many of her classes. The child must take greater responsibility for her own expenses and debts if she does not apply herself to her studies. The respondent was ordered to match the amount paid by the petitioner towards the child's expenses.

HELD: 1) The chambers judge ordered the amount of support payable by the father in accordance with the provisions of clause 3(2)(b) by having regard to the actual means and needs of the child and the financial ability of each parent to contribute to his support. However in the face of these concerns being raised by the respondent, the mother has given no evidence to rebut the father's information that she did not attend many of her classes. In my view, the adult child must take greater responsibility for her own expenses and debts if she does not apply herself to her studies. 2) Given the issues discussed supra, it is my view that the father should not be ordered to pay the table amount as it is rebuttable, having regard for the actual needs of each child and respective means of the parents."

At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff. The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.","The plaintiff was the step-father of the deceased victim. She commenced this action to recover damages for nervous shock from the defendant.

The emotional harm suffered by the plaintiff was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties. HELD: 1) The plaintiff was not the person insured under the contract. 2) It is not the result that the plaintiff would have been able to recover for mental shock. 3) Although she did not suffer any physical injuries and was not directly involved in the accident she commenced the action to advance a claim for emotional shock. 4) Section 139(2)(b) of the Insurance Act requires that a person be insured under s. 139 (2) (a) and s. 138 (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i) (j)(h)(i)(ii) (iii) (iv) (v) (vi)(v)(vi) (ii)(iii)(iv)(e)(f)(g)(j) and (v).(v). 5) The Court concluded that such a result would be impossible for the plaintiff to conclude and that the emotional harm inflicted by the cousin was too remote.  6) The court did not conclude that such an outcome was the result."

HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment. The bills were issued in two separate matters. In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue. There will be no extension of time for the first bill. The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it. He was advised that the bill would be adjusted. An initial adjustment was made and when still not satisfied, ongoing discussions about the bill continued. The Court held that the last document received by the applicant was not the final bill as it was still subject to change. In this case, the lawyer has been paid from monies held in trust for the client, the time being abridged is relatively short and neither party has alleged that any prejudice would result.","FIAT. The applicant seeks an order pursuant to s. 67(1) of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of his legal bills for services rendered to him by the respondent. The issue before the court is whether the applicant's two bills fall within the period of time allowable for assessment by the registrar and if not, whether it is in the interests of justice to abridge the time allowing for the assessment. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The time being abridged is relatively short. There were discussions between Mr. Postnikoff and Mr. Morrison concerning the appropriateness of the account at the time the account was rendered. The judge has the discretion to extend the time for assessment. 2) The applicant has been paid from monies in trust and the issue in this case is whether it was in the justice's interests to abridge the time and order the assessment of the bill.  3) There was no lawsuit commenced for the collection of the accounts.

b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","HELD: Leave to appeal was granted, the appeal allowed and the conviction set aside. The court found that the trial judge erred in principle in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry into the complainant's home and the search of the home, all without a warrant. The record here was insufficient for the court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. The trial judge held that the police had a duty to enter the residence, whether invited or not, and whether the evidence found as result of the searches should have been excluded. In the circumstances, although the call was not a 911 call, it was reasonable for the police to search for the complainant, to go to the appellant's home, and not to simply leave once the daughter told them at the door that she was fine.

b_2008skqb182.txt,"The tenant appeals the decision of the Hearing Officer granting her landlord a possession order of her rental premises. The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process. The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","The tenant appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer granting the landlord possession of her rental premises at suite B.

The Hearing Officer, in accepting this 'boyfriend related evidence' when neither the Hearing Notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rules of natural justice and due process. The decision should be taken with a view to what is necessary to ensure that justice is done between the parties. The discretion must be exercised judicially by the application of proper legal principles.  1) The notice to the tenant must contain sufficient particulars of the tenant's boyfriend and the impact his actions had upon the premises and disturbances caused by him had upon another tenant and his daughter. 2) The three days notice given the tenant (including two weekend days of Saturday and Sunday) was insufficient to allow this tenant to make arrangements to personally attend the hearing. It is clear that she took the process very seriously and spent a considerable amount of time preparing a written response to the landlord’s claim as she knew it to be. She did not ignore the process. 3) The hearing officer was properly served personally. The tenant could not have had notice of the nature and extent of the disturbance and damage allegations made related to her boyfriend nor would she have had any or adequate opportunity to respond to those allegations. 4) There was no other evidence that the hearing officer considered the tenant”s application for adjournment or dealt with it fairly or reasonably in the circumstances."

The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator.

Jurisdiction to hear such a case flows from the Probate Act and is based on the historic statutory, common law and equity authorities of the Court, pre-confederation court modelled on the English Probate Court. There were myriad factual and legal issues to be considered but perhaps the three most central issues were the wills. The immediate cause of death was mixed drug overdose. The evidence led in both respects bears repeating as it impacts upon the continuing claims for relief sought by the defendant."
4_2004skqb19.txt,"The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant. The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident. What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence. Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend.","The applicant applies by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents (Zurich and Sovereign) are obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against Westridge and others by Genex Swine Group Inc. (the 'underlying action'). The respondents issued comprehensive general liability policies in favour of Westridge. The respondents take the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend (and to pay defence costs) for the claims brought against them in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The claim is triggered. Whether a claim could trigger indemnity is a three-step process. The onus of establishing that the terms of the policy obligate the insurer to defend rests with the applicant. If there is any possibility that the claim falls within liability coverage, the insurer is obliged to provide defence. This principle is congruent with the broader tenets underlying the construction of insurance contracts, namely the contra proferentem rule, and the principle that coverage provisions should be construed broadly, while exclusion clauses should receive narrow interpretation. 2) The amount we will pay for compensatory damages is limited as described in SECTION III—LIMITS OF INSURANCE; Exclusions This insurance does not apply to: b. “bodily injury” or “property damage” which occurs during the policy period. The claims for loss of use of other tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed resulting from: (i) delay in or lack of performance by or on behalf of the Named Insured after such products or work have been put to use by any person other than an Insured. 3) Occurrence “Occurrence” includes continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which result in loss neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the Insurer. The insurer must defend. 4) In Non-Marine Underwriters, Lloyd's of London v. Scalera, 2000 SCC 24 (CanLII); [2001] S.C.R. 699 at para. 28, in the following terms: 28 The starting premise for assessing whether an insurer’s duty to defend has been triggered rests in the traditional “pleadings rule”. Whether an insurer is bound to defend depends on the pleadings filed against the insured, usually in the form of statement of claim."
1998canlii13585.txt,FIAT. Exclusive possesson and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner in May 1998. At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.,"FIAT. The court delivered a judgment under which exclusive possession and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner. At trial, both parties were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither of them would vacate the home. The final paragraph of the judgment reads: ""[18] The parties have been married for over 25 years and are now senior citizens. Given the age of the petitioner, it is expected that counsel will assist the parties in determining a reasonable time period for the petitioner to move from the home."" HELD: 1) No caselaw in support of the position of either party could be found. The issue resolved around the interpretation of Rule 15 and Rule 15 of the Court of Appeal Rules which provide: '15(1) Unless otherwise ordered by the judge, the service and filing of notice of appeal does not stay the execution of a judgment or an order awarding mandamus, an injunction, alimony or maintenance for a child or dependant adult. 2) The giving of directions by this court as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of judgment' or the taking thereof in the action and therefore, would not contravene Rule 15. No writ of certiorari or writ of habeas corpus was found. 3) No evidence was found as to the parties' position on the issue of whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession."
7_2015skqb216.txt,"Civil Procedure – ContemptCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 11-16Municipal Law – Zoning Bylaw – Enforcement The applicant rural municipality was granted an order in May 2014 by a Queen’s Bench judge that directed the respondent to comply within 60 days with an order of the applicant’s development officer. That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","The Rural Municipality of Edenwold granted an order requiring the respondent to comply within 60 days with an order of the Development Officer of the RM dated February 3, 2014. The respondent took no significant steps to comply with the order. HELD: The respondent was found in contempt of court. The only real issue in dispute was the appropriate penalty or sanction to be imposed by the court.  1) The respondent's conduct prior to the commencement of these proceedings may not generally warrant an award of solicitor and client costs, but his continued and ongoing unjustified failure to comply does. 2) He has no place other than his home acreage to park his tractor trailers between jobs or to store equipment that he requires from time to time in his contracting business. 3) The court was satisfied that this was a situation that required complete or near complete 'indemnification for costs reasonably incurred'."

8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault and breach of an undertaking contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and aggravated assault with a knife. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. HELD: The Court found that the predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752(a)(i). The Court ordered that the accused be remanded for an assessment pursuant to s752(1)(a)(ii) of the Code. Given the conviction and Criminal Code provisions for imprisonment, the sentence was reduced to imprisonment for term not exceeding fourteen years. The predicate offence is a serious injury offence. The Court held that the offences committed were different and that a lesser measure under paragraph (4)(b) or (c) will adequately protect the public against the commission by the offender of a murder or serious injury. The court also held that a long-term offender designation was appropriate given the circumstances."

HELD: The court found that any improper or unauthorized or unlawful act was not done for his own personal gain.  1)Every one who, knowing that document is forged, (a) causes or attempts to cause any person to use, deal with, or act on it, as if the document were genuine, (c) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a period not exceeding sixty days.  2)The common law doctrine of respondeat superior recognizes an employee acting within the scope of their duties is an instrument of his einployer's will. An employee cannot seek indeinnity for expenses from his employer which arose when the employee broke the law. Performing tasks outside the law says the defendant is outside the scope. It is fundainental to the case, defendant counsel argues, that if the employee breaks the law 'he is on his own'. 3)The court found no evidence that the employee committed any criminal act."

She sought to cancel arrears of $3,800 on the basis she will overpay if child support had been calculated in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines on the basis of her actual income for 1999 and 2000. She also sought to reduce child support to $17 per month based on a projected income of $7,000. HELD: 1)One-half of the arrears were cancelled. The mother must accept responsibility in part for allowing arrears to accumulate over the 2 years. 2)The mother was to pay $250 per month based on an imputed income of $15,000. She was capable of contributing more than $17 per month. Her share of s.7 expenses was reduced to $50 per month.

7_1998canlii13374.txt,"Associates, which held purchase money security interests pursuant to its 1997 leases, applied under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by Associates and Humboldt Flour Mills in two reefer trailers. Humboldt's security interests were acquired pursuant to a security agreement granted in 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in 1998 to specifically include the trailers. It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly. To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.","HELD: The application was allowed and the parties focussed their submissions solely on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s. 66. The court found that the purchase money security interests were acquired pursuant to its leases of the trailers to Lake Air in December 1997. It ordered that its purchase-money security interests in the two reefer trailers have priority over any other security interest in them. The issue to be determined was what is meant by the term 'possession' in s. 34(2)(a) and when, in the case of this case, Lake Air obtained possession orconstructive possession of the trailer within the meaning of s.34(2). The court concluded that Lake Air did not have actual or constructive possession prior to December 22, 1997 through either GJ Bell or Mid-Canada."
1995canlii6138.txt,FIAT The Defendants were consulted by the Plaintiff and her mother 11 years earlier with respect to commencing an action for personal injuries arising out of a motor vehicle accident. The Plaintiff was only 12 at the time. No action was commenced with the result that the original action was now statute-barred. She waited 5 years after she attained the age of majority before taking this action against the Defendants. The Defendants applied to stay the action on the basis that they had never been retained. HELD: Application dismissed. Infants with bona fide causes are privileged suitors. An infant 'should not be visited with the sins of the next friends and litigation guardians who preceded him/her in the same action'.,"FIAT. The applicants had destroyed their files and were preparing to file a statement of claim. The plaintiff had not explained why she waited five years after she attained majority before consulting counsel except to say that she did not believe she could do anything as result of the original advice she and her mother received from Judge Lavoie. HELD: The application was dismissed but costs were to be re-reserved to the trial judge. 1)The decision did not recognize the contingent element involved in the situation of an infant plaintiff. 2)It repeats an earlier statement that infants with bona fide causes are privileged suitors. So, an infant should not be visited with the sins of the next friends and litigation guardians who preceded him in the same action. 3)The applicants' decision to destroy their office files is understandable, but the decision does not recognize a contingent element. The comments contained in Brosseau v. Children's Aid Society of the District of Sudbury Inc. et al (1986), C.P.C. (2d) 312. 4)I have a good deal of sympathy for the applicants in this case. The application raises a number of problems including the fact that the plaintiff waited 5 years after her attained majority to consult counsel. She did not explain why she had waited for five years to reach majority. She also did not provide any evidence as to who took over the plaintiff's files or whether he practised with others who may have his case histories and patient records. It is difficult to believe that there are not medical records available from some source which would outline the scope of the treatment and his diagnosis and prognosis for the plaintiff. That very significant delay is factor that must consider, but only one. Undoubtedly there will be some prejudice to the applicants by virtue of having destroyed their file, the death of Dr. Leakos and the diminution of memories over period of 11 years. Those factors must be weighed, however, against the interests of the plaintiffs."

5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","HELD: The plaintiff and defendant entered into a contract respecting the sale of three quarters of land in the Rural Municipality of Hazel Dell. The plaintiff contended that the requirement of writing under the Statute of Frauds was an additional requirement to the usual essential elements of a valid contract. The defendant asserted that the offer was in writing via the exchange during the internet-based land auction and the acceptance was orally communicated to the plaintiff. Plaintiff sued for specific performance and damages. The court accepted the plaintiff's contention that no agreement was created and, regardless, even if an agreement existed, it was not in writing as required by the Statutes. It must be found as fact exactly what it was that the parties said. The central issue in this lawsuit is the application of the Statuting of Fraud's to the land sale agreement. The Court accepts the plaintiff’s contention that a contract was created between the defendant and the plaintiff respecting the Subject Quarters. However, the Court accepts that the plaintiff was not opening the door to considering evidence of what was actually going on in these men’ minds."
9_2009nsca91.txt,"The young person appealed his sentence on an aggravated assault conviction following a drive-by shooting and applied for release pending appeal. Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school. Application for release pending appeal dismissed. The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","The accused pleaded guilty to aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. Prior to being remanded, the accused was asked to leave the high school he had previously attended as a concern for his safety after threats had been made against him. HELD: The application for release pending appeal was dismissed. The accused had not satisfied the onus on him under s. 679(4)(a) that his appeal was sufficiently meritorious that, by the time his appeal is heard, he would likely already have served more than what is determined to be a fit sentence, and thereby suffer undue hardship if he is not released. The Court found that the appellant had not met the second condition of being released pending appeal. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault offence, his record of violent offences, and numerous breaches of court orders, the Court was not persuaded that his release would be in the public interest. The appellant's release so soon after being sentenced would tend to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice."
e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","HELD: The court held that it did not have jurisdiction to deal with the issue of retroactive child support and s.7 expenses for the parties' older child. The issues raised by the applicant's application to vary were retroactive review of the base table amount of child support paid by the respondent and the respondent's contribution to section 7 (special expenses) for the children. The respondent argued that although the variation application was filed May 30, 2008, his counsel did not receive the relevant documents until October 2008 and the retroactive recalculation should be limited to three years prior to October 9, 2008. The petitioner argued that even if that was not formal notice to the respondent, his blameworthy conduct warrants extending the period of retroactivity to more than three years."

4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","HELD: The application to terminate spousal support was commenced on the 22nd day of September, 2005.

During this separation, the appellant became increasingly depressed and became involved with another man. She sought to admit fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellant had not proven that she had a reasonable excuse for failing to challenge the separation agreement at the time of the divorce proceeding. 2)There was no evidence from the appellant's psychiatrist confirming her state of mind at the relevant time and the probable erect of the medication upon her ability to make rational decisions. The appellant's affidavit evidence was of little assistance to the Court. 3)The Court was not satisfied that the appellant had demonstrated that her reasonable excuse was that she was on medication for depression when she signed the agreement, that she declined to exercise her opportunity to receive independent legal advice, and that she now believed that she made a bad bargain. 4)The evidence was not found to be relevant to the issue before the Court as it was not an issue raised by counsel. 5)The court was not in a position where it could decide realistically whether the proffered evidence could reasonably be expected to affect the result of the trial."
d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","The trial judge held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and its representatives when the latter republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. He fixed a provisional award of damages of $25,000. HELD: Cross-appeal dismissed. The trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements were protected by qualified privilege. He would allow the appeal and fix general damages at $100,000 but fixed the damages to $25.000. 1) This appeal concerns the extent to which the principle is protected by a defamed statement. The plaintiff's and the Union's complaints were entirely 'unfounded and without substance'. 2) The plaintiff did not know about the mail-out to the Union members. It is now a 21st century reality that the internet and web pages will be used by large organizations (such as this union), to communicate with its membership. 3) There was no evidence that the plaintiff took an active part in harassing the Union member. It was clear that the words refer to the plaintiff and that they were published. The words expressed by the Union would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person. 4) The court found that the trial judge made no error in law when he concluded that there was no merit to the grievance and concluded the words were entirely untrue. The court also found the plaintiff had in fact been defamed by the publication of the Grievance Report. 5) The Court concluded that the jurisprudence is circumspect in granting absolute privilege and the scope of the privilege is narrowly interpreted. It would be improper to extend the cloak of absolute privilege to what has been described as'steps preparatory to judicial proceedings' but the purpose in this case was an attempt to find corroborating witnesses. This purpose is not so intimately connected with the process as to justify the extension of the defence. 6) There is a palpable and overriding error standard. The standard of review to apply is correctness with respect to whether an impugned communication is capable of bearing defamed meaning, but whether the expression is in fact defamed is question of fact and, as such, is reviewable on a palpable error standard (see: Torstar)."

The accused was grossly lacking in mental abilities, had limited and basic comprehension, had the mental capacity of a young child and these facts were not likely to change anytime soon. The accused had extreme difficulty paying attention to the court proceedings and appeared incapable of doing so. He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD: The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability. The accused said that his lawyer was the judge, could not answer when asked what the judge's role was and he had limited insight into why he was in Court.

According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence. The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding.","The accused was found unfit to stand trial for various offences.

The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift. The mother of the deceased appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed, the appellant had failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death.

In preparation, the appellant applied to the Supreme Court for an order to inspect the respondent's bank records pursuant to s. 21(1) of the Evidence Act.

HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is entered.  1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place. 2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence. The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law.

The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination.

They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case.

HELD: The Court refused to issue the order on the grounds that the Court must not be seen as legitimatizing, condoning, acquiescing or approving of an unconscionable bargain.","The Court was presented with a form of a consent judgment bearing the consents of the petitioner and the respondent. At first blush, one might assume the Court should grant the parties the relief they appear to jointly be seeking. However, the terms of the proposed judgment are unconscionable. There has not been equality in bargaining positions. The petitioner seems content to receive assets mainly in the value of her car, which represents her receiving about 13% of the net value of the family property estate, leaving the remaining 87% to be the respondent's share. The proposed judgment also provides that the respondent is not obliged to pay child support in the foregoing circumstances. HELD: The Court awarded the petitioner the costs of the application. 1)The terms were clearly improvident. The parties did not need Court order nor judgment to attain their apparent goals. It was certainly open to them to proceed with this arrangement without the formality of judgment or contract. Another option was to reduce their understanding to writing, even if there is no lawyer prepared to sign certificate of independent advice for obvious reasons. 2)There was not equality in the bargaining positions of the respondent and the petitioner. When upon the evidence filed the terms appeared to be patently unfair or unconscionsable to one of the parties, it was the Court's position that the parties should have joint custody of the two children and that they should respect their wishes as to their choice of residence and the time they might wish to spend with each parent."

The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, for driving with a blood alcohol content over.08.

The officer observed the appellant swaying in a tight turn as she proceeded from stop sign onto highway leading out of Tisdale. He noted that other car tracks in the soft snow gave the appellant a strong feeling of alcohol on her breath. Smokers will light up cigarette not solely for the purpose of masking the odour of alcohol but out of nervousness or other cause. The judge failed to consider evidence that the appellant required no assistance to exit her vehicle, walk to and enter the police cruiser without assistance. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not make any findings of fact that were unsupported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he held that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported the officer's belief the appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired. The evidence as found by the trial judge was reliable and capable of supporting the officer’s belief. The court dismissed ground one of the appeal.  2)The appellant contends that the failure of the officer to provide her with the Prosper warning resulted in a breach of her s10(b). The standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is very high.  3)On the first ground, which is factual one, the test is based on an error of law, failure to consider the evidence in its totality and/or an error respecting specific piece of relevant evidence may ground a successful appeal."

There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time. The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old.

The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","This summary conviction appeal by the Crown was brought when the trial judge dismissed charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08 percent. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner in which the Crown applied for the information was an abuse of process at common law. HELD: 1)The trial judge erred in finding that the court had lost jurisdiction as he specifically found that if there was loss of jurisdiction it was over the offence, but in dismissing the Information he relied on the provisions of s. 485(2) of the Criminal Code which relate to loss of control over the accused and not the offence. The special plea was not available in the circumstances of this case. The informations sworn in March 2001 and March 29, 2001 in this proceeding were stayed. 2)The special plea did not appear in Saskatchewan until May 2001. 3)The court was unable to agree that appearance by the respondent in a Saskatchewan court as a result of a summons issued before May 7, 2001 revived jurisdiction over the respondent. 4)The evidence before the court was inconclusive as to whether the special plea had been accepted in Alberta or whether the Alberta Provincial Court had lost its jurisdiction. 5)The fact that the Alberta provincial court had not lost jurisdiction in Alberta and could have regained jurisdiction by following the procedure set out in s.485.1 of the Code does not give rise to a successful plea. The police procedure adopted by the police in Alberta amounted to an abuse. 6)There was no evidence to support the claim that the Special Plea of Autrefois Acquit was applicable in this case as it was the province where the offence was committed and the province in which it was committed. 7)The information was sworn in Saskatchewan on March 1, 2001 and brought before the Provincial Court in Lloydminster on March 5, 2001. The respondent had not been summonsed and was not present on that date. The only remedy left is an appeal. In Alberta the charges were deemed to be dismissed for want of prosecution.

The purpose of the arrangement was to assist in relieving the Shareholders against the losses suffered by them and to provide missing shareholders with an opportunity to confirm their status and to participate in the distribution of capital on dissolution. HELD: The court found that s.186.1 was being used by the corporation for a purpose which the legislature did not intend. The context within which this was provided must be considered. The proposal was not undertaken for a valid business purpose within the approval criteria set forth in The Companies Winding Up Act.  1)The court found no conflict between the power of the court to approve a proposed distribution and the powers given to the court under s.185.1(4) and (m) of the Act. 2)It is not possible for a corporation that is not insolvent to effect a fundamental change in the nature of an arrangement under any other provision of The Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act. It is just and equitable that the court has the power to approve distribution to shareholders of their entitlement, qua shareholders, either in the form of money or division of the property or assets of the corporation. 3)The Court found no evidence that the proposed distribution was a 'dispute' between the parties. 4)It was not possible to find the court's analysis in BCE to be equally applicable to the proposed arrangement."
c_2014skpc114.txt,The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. The plaintiff had not proven his claim on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was responsible for the damage to his lawn.,"The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant applied a substance in the back alley next to his property which caused damage to his lawn in the Town of Wadena. A report by Back-Track Investigations and Special Services Ltd. (Back-Track) supports the Plaintiff's belief that damage occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of a substance from a back alley. However, the onus is not on the Plaintiff to prove his claim on a balance of probabilities and this involves proving that Statchuk was responsible for killing their lawn. For the reasons stated, the plaintiff has not done so. HELD: The Plaintiff's claim is dismissed. 1)The evidence of the town employee called by the Plaintiff is not supported by the evidence. It appears highly unlikely that the offending substance came from gravel used in graveling the alley. There were no similar issues anywhere else in town where gravel from the same source was used. The back alley slopes from the house to the Charbonneau yard. Defence led evidence of a house was demolished in the area and debris may have been removed through the alley, suggesting that perhaps this was the cause of the damage. 2)The defendant has access to farm chemicals through his employment with Crop Production Services and formerly with Viterra. His evidence is that it is unlikely that glyphosate or Ally killed the lawn but that soil sterilant was probably to blame. Photographs, as well as the evidence given by Wendell and Sandra, both testified that the cost to him to test for numerous substances until they found the presence of the one killing the grass would have been prohibitive. There is no evidence of what substance got into the lawn and killed it. No samples were taken from the alley to test the chemical substance there. 3)The plaintiff was not satisfied that the defendant had anything to do with putting the substance into the alley or that it came from the defendant's property."
c_1995canlii5774.txt,"The parties applied to the Court to resolve the issues of spousal support and a division of the matrimonial property. The parties had been married 4 years. There were no children of the marriage. The Wife had a university education but was unemployed. She had already received interim support in the amount of $1,500.00 per month for 1 year. HELD: 1)The support order was terminated effective November 30, 1995. 2)The Court determined the value of a resort property owned by the Husband in BC and permitted an exemption for its value as at the date of marriage. 3)The Court refused to permit the Wife to subtract from the value of her assets, the amount owing on a student loan which pre-dated the marriage. 4)With the exception of those items already discussed, the Court divided the value of the matrimonial property equally.","The parties were unable to resolve three issues related to the date spousal support should be terminated and whether the wife's student loan was a matrimonial debt. HELD: 1/2 share to each party was ordered for another year. The husband was entitled to an exemption for this amount pursuant to section 23 of the Matrimonial Property Act. The value of the property was determined to be $49,000 on the date the action was commenced. In addition, the 6 Cominco Limited shares in the husband's possession were to be sold and the net proceeds divided equally. The respondent's obligation should end on November 30, 1995 and there will be an order accordingly. The $88460 total value for distribution was $103,505. The court valued the property at $48,000. The loan was used to pay debts incurred by the wife prior to the marriage. It is illogical and unfair that he should be required to share payment of them."

This appeal was based on the argument the provincial court judge's decision failed to provide reasons for accepting the evidence of various witnesses, failed to make findings of credibility with respect to witnesses, and failed to comment on the credibility and evidence of the witnesses. The appellant complained the judge did not provide adequate reasons for the decision. Dismissing the appeal, that the decision was supported by the evidence. The court referred to R. v. Burns, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656 at 664, where the Supreme Court of Canada held that if trial judges state their conclusions in brief, and these conclusions are supported by the evidence, the verdict should not be overturned merely because they fail to discuss collateral aspects of the case.","The appellant was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drug. The trial judge reserved his decision and then found him guilty. The appellant appealed the conviction. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge failed to provide reasons and to enunciate his findings of fact in reaching the conclusion that the appellant 'knew or ought to have known of the effects of the drug that he was taking'.

b_1993canlii6618.txt,Members of the Association of Professional Engineers who were also SIAST employees challenged the statutory provisions and collective bargaining agreement whereby they were compelled to become members of the SGEU. In Queen's Bench it was held that the statutory provisions which created two bargaining units for institute employees and required certain employees to be union members did not violate s.2(d) of the Charter. Appeal dismissed,"The appeal was dismissed. The case was put to the court prematurely, with the result that it was put on what was essentially a hypothetical basis, and Charter decisions should not be made without sufficient factual base. There was no evidence put before the court that the appellants or any of them had yet suffered any adverse consequences as result of the impugned legislation, although proceedings were pending before the Labour Relations Board which might result in adverse consequences. HELD: The appeal [from 1992 CanLII 7943 (SK QB), [1992] 6 W.W.R. 116] must be dismissed. Appeal dismissed. 1) There is some confusion as to the answers he gave to the questions posed in his judgment. In an addendum, he said the answer to question should be no. It seems clear that he was referring to question 5 rather than question 4. The result is the same, in any event. 2) The Court was in general agreement with the reasoning of Wright J. Although his reasons were clear, there was some confusion regarding the answers to the question questions. The answer to a question 5 seems to be rather than a question 4, nor was there any evidence as to why anyone objected to being a member of the bargaining unit in question or the union in question so as to permit any reasoned decision to the alleged right not to associate. 3) The respondents shall have their costs of the appeal under double col. V, except the Attorney General who did not ask for costs."
c_1995canlii5987.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and was tried in the Court of Queen's Bench. The evidence at trial indicated that the alleged acts had occurred prior to the accused becoming an adult. He had not been ordered transferred into adult court under s.16 of The Young Offenders Act. HELD: Accused acquitted. 1)The Judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had sexually assaulted the complainant. 2)Because the complainant's evidence suggested that the assault occurred while the accused was a young offender the Judge concluded that the Court of Queen's Bench was without jurisdiction in the matter.,"The accused was charged with sexually assaulting the complainant between the dates of October 1986 and March 31, 1988 at Beardy's Indian Reserve. Although the one or two incidents of improper touching took place after the sexual intercourse incident, she quite frankly admitted that the incident occurred long before he became an adult. HELD: The Court of Queen's Bench had exclusive jurisdiction respecting offences committed by persons under the age of 18 years. The accused was acquitted of the charge in theindictment. 1)Any of the incidents of sexual assault committed by the accused occurred on or after October 22, 1986. The complainant was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he had forced sexual intercourse with her when she was or 9 but that he was not able to perform the act. 2)The evidence of the sexual assault did not conform to the age specified in the indictment. The Crown could not find any other evidence beyond that age. 3)The accused had moved to Prince Albert while he was still young and had no further contact with the complainant. 4)The complainant was satisfied that the accused had not committed any sexual assaults while she was a young person. 5)Although the Crown had declined jurisdiction to charge the accused with sexual assault, the Crown could have charged him with assault if the evidence had not been satisfied that he could have stopped the assault on the complainant when he was 11 or 12 years old. 6)The Court had jurisdiction only when a matter was transferred to it pursuant to s.5 of the Young Offenders Act."
5_2001canlii345.txt,"The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act, 1997. HELD: The accused was found guilty of operating an overweight vehicle on a road to which the minister's weight restriction applied. There was no other notice given to the municipal division in which the grid roads were located and to entities situated along highway #1 that were involved in the transport of goods. The Minister's department placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on highway #332 as well as other signs describing an alternative truck route. The signs were located on numerous grid roads in the area. It was not the local municipality to satisfy the obligation imposed upon the minister to provide notice of his order but, in this case, the municipality appears to have taken it upon itself to advise persons in the municipal divisions affected by the weight restriction and to advise other persons in that area that were in the business of hauling. No other notice was given."
3_1997canlii11384.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. who was alleged to be of unsound mind. H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing. The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected. If the court failed to intervene H.B. will be left in limbo, a victim of the system.","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for the mother of the child alleged to be of 'unsound mind'. HELD: The order was issued. Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction, the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of the mother and she requires independent representation to ensure that her rights are protected. In certain jurisdictions Public Trustees have by statute the authority to act as a litigation guardian on behalf of H.B. However that does not fully determine the issue. It is significant that the inclusion of the public trustee in the definition of litigation guardian (paragraphs 46(2)(d) and 22(1)(b)) are circumscribed by reference to s32 of The Child and Family Services Act. Therefore the Rules do not enlarge the provisions of the Act and cannot serve as the basis to appoint the public trustee as the personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult."
1996canlii6754.txt,"A radio station reported that a 12 year old girl was dragged and sexually assaulted behind a roller rink or between the rink and a store. The owner of the rink claimed financial compensation for a subsequent decline in his business which he alleged was a direct result of the broadcast. The script and reel had been destroyed and it was impossible to recreate exactly what was aired. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing that the defendant published was false, malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. 2)The station followed the CRTC Regulations and was exonerated entirely by its controlling body. The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source. 3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation. The business was on a down side at the time. The assault occurring where it did was not the fault of either party. If it had a bearing on the immediate attendance figure it was minimal and the plaintiff did no promotion whatsoever to increase attendance.","A 12 year old girl and two juvenile offenders were found in the vicinity of a roller skating rink. They had been sexually assaulted by two juveniles. The plaintiff's solicitor verified this herself with the police after Ludwig Deli called the station late in the morning. The tapes were kept for eight weeks. The defendant published the news that it received from the police, which was always a proven reliable source. Nothing was proven to be malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published. Nothing points to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff in its Roller Rink operation. HELD: 1)The plaintiff's cause of action was dismissed with costs.  2)The defendant did what it was requested to do and was exonerated by the CRTC for doing so. 3)Nothing was found to be factually correct about the defendant's report on the sexual assault. The fact that the plaintiff's business was on the down side at the time of the assault did not mean that it was the cause of the loss. The evidence was that the defendant was merely doing its job of reporting news; there was no way they knew or ought to have known that news that were aired would cause harm to the plaintiff or to their business and their health. 4)The court found that the defendants published the information that it receives from the RCMP, which is always a reliable source of information. It did not point to the defendants as being responsible for the financial loss by the victim in its roller rink operation."

When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital. As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter.

8_2016skqb154.txt,"HELD: The order was granted. Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","The Ministry sought a permanent wardship order with respect to two children. The parents of the children, despite being more or less involved with the proceedings for some of the period, did not appear for the trial of the action. The evidence showed the father had taken no measurable steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues. The children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at the hands of their father."
b_2013skqb395.txt,HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of 10 counts and 7 counts were dismissed.,"The accused was charged with 14 counts of indecent assault and three counts of gross indecency against 14 individuals, all of whom were boys who attended the residential school between January 1, 1959 and December 31, 1967. The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys at the school. He developed the intermural hockey, competitive fastball and softball teams, and the Warriors, which was the regional champion hockey team through most of the years that he developed and coached. There were numerous photos of the accused wearing beaded jackets, moccasins and beaver mitts in spite of the accusations by some that these were taken away and never returned. The court noted that countervailing factors such as the inflammatory nature of the similar facts and whether the Crown can prove its point with less prejudicial evidence reinforced the prejudice inherent in the poisonous nature of propensity evidence."
c_2012skqb372.txt,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application for relief in the alternative as follows: (a) that the plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or (b) the plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Insurance. HELD: 1) The delay from June 2010 to May 2012 really is a delay from May 2011 until May 2012 and solely on the head of counsel for the plaintiff for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. This is at a point where it could well go to pre-trial conference. Therefore it is not at such an early stage that it would lead the Court on its own to strike. 2) The public policy behind settlement privilege is compelling one. It is so compelling that even threats arising in the context of settlement negotiations may not justify an exception. The context in which the delay occurred is not such as to lead me to the position that this claim should be struck on that basis. While one year is an excessive period of time, the defendant has made its case and ordered the specific amounts for each structure for which the plaintiff settled its claim to be disclosed."

However, he appears to have had a very bad habit of not paying the child support. Any explanation for this would be considered by the court. 3) Based on the British Columbia Tables, the applicant has an obligation, according to the British Tables, to pay $425 for the one child. 4) The respondent has established the necessary change in circumstance, namely, the introduction of the Federal Child Support Guidelines in order to proceed with his variation regarding his ongoing maintenance payments. 5) Given that the applicant is currently earning the sum of $45,784 per year, he can afford to pay reasonable payment towards the outstanding maintenance payments for the child. 6) For all the reasons set out above, the application was dismissed. 7) The Court would have to determine he has a present inability to pay child support and, secondly, that he will not in the future be able to pay it."

d_2000canlii19583.txt,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused stands charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called the alleged victim's son, Cory, the 15-year-old mascot for the Raider Hockey Club, Timothy Sabo, another fan, Adam Balicki and another fan as witnesses. HELD: The accused was found guilty as charged. 1) The Court held that given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan, the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that the bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The accused is responsible for all of the results of the assault which he committed, no matter how unforeseen or how unintentional. 2) In reviewing the case law from other jurisdictions, it is very important to note that the Court of Appeal expressly did not follow R.v. Nurse, (1993), 83 C.C.L. (3d) 546, the decision of the Ontario Court of Court which found that the Crown did have to prove objective foreseeability. It held that the accused driving was a contributing cause of death outside the deminimus range. 3) The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to the accused in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. The short period between the assault and bodily harm was closely related in time and otherwise. 4) The answer to the negative question was easily answered in the negative. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile-up resulting from the assault resulting. The third parties falling on top of the accused and Mr. Brown, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as direct result of the actions of the defendants. 5) It was clear that the two disinterested witnesses to this event were not related to each other. 6) The court concluded that the second question should be answered by the affirmative. 7) The second question was asked in the positive. 8) The third party involved was the same as the accused. 9) The fact that Cory was motionless in the middle of the street during that very short period of time was enough approximate cause for the accused to be guilty of the full offence charged. 10) The offence was more than an insignificant or trivial cause. 11) The Crown did not have to show the accused foresaw or intended the death or serious harm to the victim."

The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The issue is whether the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply and that hearsay evidence was inadmissible. The defendant opposed the admission of these documents. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Court found that the normal criminal rules of admissibility apply and the Crown applied to have the criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and the NPB's reasons for ordering detention admitted into evidence. 2) The Crown called two witnesses to identify the contents of the warrant expiry package as CSC records and to testify about some of the documents. A third witness was called to testify that he reviewed the warrant outiry package and swore the information.  3) The court held that the usual rule of evidence applicable in criminal trials does not apply. 4) The accused was entitled to the disclosure of his or her personal information to the defence. 5) The defence opposed admission of any documents. 6) The trial judge erred in failing to follow previous decisions of this court which held that CSC documents are admissible business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. 7) There was no evidence as to the identity of the witnesses. 8) The judge relied on R. v. Fontaine, 2010 SKPC 16 (CanLII), 356 Sask.R. 273, where the standard of proof for the trier of fact was reasonable ground to believe. The judge also held that there were reasonable and probable grounds for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. 9) The respondent was not released from custody until the sentence expired in March 2012. 10) The Provincial Court judge did not call the authors of the report nor did the defence seek to cross-examine them. 11) The evidence was not admissible in evidence at the hearing. The Court held that it was not intended that the judge strictly apply the rules of law."
2_2008skca172.txt,"The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing the death of Tanya Bergen, contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code and causing bodily harm to Helen McDermott. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appealed both his conviction and the sentence imposed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Crown counsel should not have put these questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. 2) The appellant's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved within the vehicle in the course of the collision was not objected to when it occurred and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised. 3) In all of the circumstances of this case, Crown counsel clearly has discretion, pursuant to Corbett, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case, this discretion is exercised on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. However, the appellant was prejudiced by the questions."
d_2013skca10.txt,"The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, Currie J. declared him a dangerous offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The trial judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of the two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long-term offender instead of a dangerous one. The judge's view that the defendant was not willing to take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for the sexual assaults was prophetic. He followed this up with a letter dated August 28, 2010 to this Court where he said that he did not sexually assault anyone and was falsely accused by the victims who were forced to lie by the police. 2) The defendant was found not guilty of all of the offences and was sentenced to an indefinite period of imprisonment. 3) The court was not bound to accept the experts' assessment of his risk for re-offending. The defendant had been in custody since July 2005 for four degrading sexual assaults upon vulnerable women and had yet to take the high intensity sexual offender treatment program which the experts acknowledge is pre-requisite for rehabilitation. 4) There was no evidence that the trial judge overemphasized the importance of protection of the public. For the reasons that follow, the court dismisses the appeal. 5) The judge instructed himself properly on the law and noted the appropriate authorities in order to decide the contested issue, namely the third point in s. 753.1(1) of the Criminal Code: whether 'there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of risk in the community'. 6) The Court is not bound by the experts to accept their assessment."
d_2006nsca24.txt,"In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home. The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","The wife applied for an interlocutory order that the matrimonial home be put up for sale. The husband opposed the order claiming a reversible error on the part of the Chambers judge in two respects. First, that he had no evidence before him to justify selling the house and divide the proceeds of sale equally between the parties, and that he was influenced by irrelevant considerations relating to the behaviour of the appellant. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; case remitted to the Supreme Court on an expedited basis for rehearing and proper determination. The Chambers judge ordered the sale of the home and ordered the equity in it divided equally after deducting legal fees and real estate commission; second, that the appellant's obligation to continue paying support to the wife (over and above the increased mortgage) shall continue only until the earlier of either the sale or June 2006 (being the day after the June mortgage payment is due)."
8_2007skqb419.txt,"In January 1992, the parties agreed the petitioner would pay child support of $300 per month and that it would be without tax ramifications to either party. As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.",FIAT: The petitioner seeks an interim order setting his ongoing child support obligation as well as addressing the arrears. Arrears have accumulated and he seeks to expunge them. The petitioner is part of a family farm operation. He supplements his farm income with working for part of the season at local sporting store. This generates some rental income. The respondent takes the position the petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further I am not prepared to rescind any of the payments. HELD: 1) The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year the petitioner pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. However one cannot ignore the fact that in 1992 the payor agreed to pay $300 per month non-taxable. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. 2) Any delay in enforcement of the ongoing payments would cause hardship to the petitioner; and 7. The payor's ability to pay at the time they were incurred was not a significant issue in the circumstances. Any further delay would be considered. Any increase in arrear would be without tax ramifications to either party.
2011skpc153.txt,The accused was charged with dangerous driving. The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light. The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a highway in a manner that was dangerous to the public contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. While the speed of one hundred and forty kilometres per hour was for a short period of time, the conduct was a marked departure from the standard expected for a reasonably prudent driver. The only conclusion that the Court can draw is that this driving action was planned and deliberate. HELD: The accused was found guilty as charged. 1) The driving was deliberate. 2) The mens rea was inferred from the driving conduct. 3) The accused voluntarily undertook to drive his vehicle and accelerate to this rate on this stretch of road. The driving must constitute a'marked departure' from the standards expected for reasonably prudent drivers. The accused's conduct was clearly deliberate. 4) The Court can only conclude that the driving was planned, deliberate and that the accused was driving within the confines of the s. 49(1) Motor Vehicle Act. 5) The court cannot infer from driving conduct that the offence was planned or deliberate. 6) There is no reasonable doubt that the driver was driving dangerously. 7) There was no evidence as to why the accused chose to accelerate so fast. 8) The officer was not aware of the danger involved in the conduct of the accused."
8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. HELD: 1) Does this Court have jurisdiction to set aside a certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench? 2) If so, what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the certificate? 3) The applicant either declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language on the certificate. This, at the very least, amounts to wilful blindness. 4) There is no evidence that the applicant cannot read or has any limitations that might effect his ability to understand the documentation served upon him. It logically follows that where a judgment is filed in this Court that this Court is clothed with jurisdiction to exercise it discretion and provide remedy in appropriate circumstances. 5) The Court has jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a true appeal that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. 6) There are at least two bases upon which it can be found that there can be a Court's discretion and provided remedy. 7) The principles and considerations that flow from them and which have developed in relation to the opening up of noting for default and in setting aside default are much different. There has been no independent evidentiary based finding that a judgment of this Court was obtained as a result of the failure of an employer (or for that matter an employee) who has missed the 21 day limitation imposed by s. 62(1) of the Act. The Court is not obliged to grant an extension of time in which to serve a certificate. 8) The court has jurisdiction in Farmers of North America because it was not a 'true appeal' that asked a judge to grant a de novo hearing. 9) The Queen’s Bench Rules provide for the opening of a noting for a default. 10) The application is to be made as soon as possible after the judgment sought to be set aside comes to the attention of the applicant in the event of any delay. If the employee had sued the employer for the wages, which it would be her right to do, and if a statement of claim had been served, but not defended, and the matter was noted for default, the Court is without jurisdiction"
9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","Dr. Huerto commenced an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his patients' accounts. With one small exception, the claim was dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which he enjoyed success at trial. HELD: Both the appeal and the cross appeal must be dismissed. 1) The Protocol and MCIB's related use of the AU code are invalid because they amount to an attempt to regulate his pattern of practice. The Protocol is obviously an individualized administrative process. However, it is necessary to understand the broad outline of the scheme which governs payment for physician services in Saskatchewan. 2) There are situations where the Government has the right to ask for additional information before agreeing to pay an account. In this case, the Protocol is not inconsistent with s. 17(1)(c) of the MCIA which is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished.' 3) The principles of the Protocol, referred to in s. 18(2)(j) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act (the MCIA) are best characterized, perhaps among other things, as means by which MCIB, on behalf of the Government, can request further information in circumstances where there are concerns about the relationship between the service covered by an account and other services. 4) The provisions do not amount to a payment schedule uniquely applicable to the physician. They merely set out the circumstances in which further information will be requested. The trial judge should have declined jurisdiction because the trial judge failed to take advantage of the internal appeal procedures available to physicians dissatisfied with the Government's assessment of their accounts. 5) The protocol ties directly into the “Assessment Rules” portion of the Schedule. It states that accounts may be adjusted if the interval between series of these codes exceeds 100 days, anything less than 100 days should be rejected explanatory code BA. 6) In order to properly assess its merit, it would be necessary to look more deeply at the Schedule as a means of determining whether such reductions should be made. 7) It would be impossible for the Government to look behind the face of accounts presented for payment."
4_2005nssc253.txt,"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.",This was an application for an order for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13 and an interim payment under Rule 31.01. The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle and said in her affidavit she was struck from behind by the defendant. The defendant argued there was a 'air of realty' to the plaintiff's argument that her injuries had resulted in any ongoing inability of the plaintiff to work in any capacity. Judgement entered against the defendant on the basis that there had to be an air of realism to the defendant's argument. It was not the function of the court in determining the matter of an interim payments to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them.
d_2006nssc73.txt,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","HELD: The Court found that it would be in the best interests of the parties to have custody of their four children. The parties were unable to agree on the ongoing custodial arrangements with respect to the two younger children, who were living with their mother when they were not attending university. The respondent was 65 years of age and retired. He drove a taxi driver from time to time. He also maintained a truck driver's license and drove a cab on a part-time basis. The petitioner was 41 years old. She worked full-time as a daycare worker. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Mount Saint Vincent University. She also earned a Master of Social Work degree from Dalhousie University. Although the parties lived in the same apartment for many years, they moved to Nova Scotia in 2005. They had three children from their first marriage. They were all born in the mother's home and lived with their father for most of their lives. The mother lived with the father when he was in university and the parties' two older children lived with her in the father's home. The father's evidence all too frequently gravitated to what he considered to be his wife's transgressions and issues relating to money. HELD: 1) The Court held that the children should remain in the custody and primary care of their mother. 2) The court found that there was no evidence that the parties would ever be able to co-parent in spite of the fact that they were all teenagers."

HELD: The decisions reviewed by the Court all support the view that leave to cross-examine under Rule 317 is granted more readily in proposed class actions than it is in other civil proceedings. None support the proposition that proposed representative plaintiff is immune from cross-examination in respect of his or her individual claim. Cross-examination of proposed representative plaintiff may explore matters pertaining to his or her individual claim in the context of issue that must be determined by the court pursuant to s. and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act.

The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18. HELD: The application for cross-examination was granted.

e_1991canlii4217.txt,"The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act. The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","This was an appeal pursuant to s. 19 of the Health Services Tax Act in respect of a decision of the Provincial Tax Commission to cancel a claim for a refund of health services tax by the applicant, Continental Seafoods Ltd. The contract contained stringent quality specifications governing the processing of pickled whole herring. The use of a cold room in the process performed a function that was part of the manufacture or production of the product. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the appellant was awarded its costs. 1)The Act has since been significantly amended to allow additional grounds to be raised.  2)The exemption does not depend on the degree to which the goods are used in the manufacturing process. The function described by the Appellant of the refrigeration equipment cannot, in the opinion of the Minister, be reasonably said to be fully part of production of its product so as to bring it within, subject to the definition in clause 1(ca), the exemption available in clause 10(1)(h)(I) of the Act. 3)Once it has been established that the machinery or apparatus is used directly in the production of a product, this is sufficient.

The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles. The R. v. Emke decision is outdated. 3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty. There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with failing to display on licence plates current and valid validation stickers issued to that person pursuant to the Vehicle Administration Act with respect to the registration of a marked police vehicle. The officer observed that the vehicle displayed an out of date sticker on it's license plate in violation of s. 27(5) of Highway Traffic Act. He engaged the police lights, followed the vehicle north on 4th Ave. West, bounced off the curb and then proceeded to stop within 30 feet. The accused nearly fell over when he exited the vehicle. HELD: 1) The Police Act provides that a police officer is responsible for policing when there is an agreement between the province and the federal government. The wording used by parliament was clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country. There is nothing in the scheme or object of The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act that derogates from that basic presumption. 2) The police act must be read in a context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner taking away jurisdiction granted to R.C.M.P. officers by the RCMP Act.  3) The words 'are assigned' refer to the three distinct objects and not to specific areas of jurisdiction where the police officers are employed within the province. It would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by Federal legislation. 4) In reviewing the scheme and object of the police force it is clear that section and section of the Act operate to render the Royal Canadian RCMP officers part of 'police force for Canada' and peace officers 'for every part of Canada' with 'all the powers, authority, protection and privileges that a peace officer has by law.' 5) The language used by the police is clear, wide, unambiguous and in harmony with that intention, object and scheme and with the general body of the law. It is not helpful in determining what the law is and what the scope of his duties and responsibilities are. 6) There is no good public policy reason for the police officer to be excluded from operating in any specific geographic area. 7) When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated.

4_2017skqb205.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8 The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim. ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA). They sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to ss. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. HELD: 1)The order was granted pursuant to Rule 3-72 and s. 3-84 of the Queen's Bench Rules. In the alternative, the defendants sought to have the plaintiff appointed as a plaintiff and to amend the Statement of Claim in the manner proposed. For the reasons that follow, that application is denied for that reason.  2)The court was satisfied that neither of the defendants would suffer actual prejudice as a result of the proposed amendments.

b_2007skqb388.txt,"The accused was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08. The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated. The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand. HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","The appellant was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over.08. The trial judge concluded that contrary to s. 8 of the Charter the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand and the admission of the certificate of analysis could bring the administration of justice in disrepute. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittal set aside. 1) The evidence was excluded because the trial judge found the appellant would not have relied upon the results of the ASD test. 2) The appellant did not know when the respondent had taken her last drink. He knew it was possible that she had consumed alcohol within the 15 minutes prior to the demand. 3) The Court of Appeal compared the facts in Einarson to those dealt with by the Supreme Court of Canada in Bernshaw, supra, and at paragraph 22 concluded that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the test."
d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff asks the court to rule regarding three distinct categories of questions asked but designated as undertakings. Former Rule 212 required the production of documents'relating to any matter in question' while former Rule 222 permitted examination for discovery 'touching the matters in issue'. The Queen's Bench Rules now provide that the production obligation is to 'disclose all documents relevant to any issue in the action' (Rule 5-6); and questioning obligation is about information or documents that are relevant to the plaintiff's claim. HELD: The court found that when the plaintiff moved from the words of touching and relating to an issue, it intended to move away from the broad relevance test that existed under the former Rules. 1) It is clear that the insurance adjuster's file would be subject to a litigation privilege. It is open to the possibility that the plaintiff may have some information that might be relevant to its claim. 2) There may be many situations where it is entirely appropriate and an efficient approach to ask a defendant whether they accept certain costs or expenses as result of the action or to advise which they say relate and do not relate to the derailment is of such nature and scale that it is not appropriate. However, it is ultimately a plaintiff's burden to prove its damages and a defendant is not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. 3) The plaintiff is not obliged to provide answers to questions which it refused to answer on discovery. 4) The applicant's refusal to provide a response to a request for an undertaking is not justified. 5) The court was also of the opinion that for proportionality reasons Clarke should not be required to answer the requested undertaking. 6) The application raises questions about the proper scope of production and questioning. The court concluded that matters relating to railcars previously loaded by the plaintiff are not within the scope of questioning."

Moreover, the argument is even further removed from those which the Union's by-laws, however the defendant posits that an expansive reading of CUPE National's sby-laws would lead to an immediate judgment against the Union. 4) In this case, the essential nature is precisely that of the dispute between the union and the union relates to an interpretation of the terms of the Union membership contract in sum, the very type of debate contemplated by the Supreme Court in Berry v.

HELD: The application for stay was dismissed. 1)There is a reasonable apprehension of bias such that the right to a fair trial by an impartial jury has been violated. 2)Challenges for cause are desirable and the court will permit counsel so wish providing that a list of proposed questions is presented to it for it perusal by 930 a.m. Thursday October 1st, 1998. It may be that such an exercise will lead to the discovery that noimpartial jurors can be found but until this exercise is attempted we are left with mere speculation as to the effect of the publicity. 3)The trial publicity generated in this case was filled as it was with prejudicial and inflammatory information. There was reasonable apprehension that the publicity would irreparably prejudiced potential jurors or so impaired the presumption that a juror not disqualified by law in a contract killing involving the Hells Angels will perform his duties in accordance with his oath."

HELD: The accused are sentenced to 40 months imprisonment for the offence of robbery with violence and 4 months consecutive for the offence of having their faces masked. Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months. The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","The accuseds were found guilty after trial of robbery with violence and assault with a weapon contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The accuseds had been in custody since January 31, 2007 and were in custody for nearly 10 months. HELD: 1) The sentence imposed was two years to be served in a federal penitentiary.  2) The aggravating and mitigating factors referred to were aggravating, the harm inflicted upon the victim, the need to deter others who might consider committing the offence of robbery, the defendant's lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence against the victim and the fact that a high speed chase ensued within the City of Regina, and the need for determent and deterrence. These are appropriate sentences in the circumstances.  3) The sentences imposed were based on the factors aggravating the accuseds' criminal record."
6_2011nssc48.txt,"The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building. The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income. Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue. When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs. The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.","HELD: The plaintiff was awarded damages for injuries suffered when she jumped from the top floor of a three-storey apartment building. Liability and damages were at issue in this case. Although there was no evidence the defendant was responsible for the fire, the defendant's conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. The fire alarm system was not functioning at the time of the fire. There were problems with the electrical system not functioning prior to the fire which was known to the supervisor. Also, yearly testing of the smoke alarms was required. The plaintiff's injury must fall within the ambit of the risk created by the breach. The battery operated smoke alarm in the plaintiff's apartment did not function. The tenant was uninformed as to whether the smoke detector formed part or was self-contained and the fire department was not there."
6_1997canlii9949.txt,The applicant sought an order requesting an absolute order of discharge in bankruptcy. The bankrupt was indebted to Canada Student Loans and Saskatchewan Student Loans. He had obtained a Bachelor of Science degree but was unable to complete his final year of Veterinary Medicine because he had received the maximum amount of financing available. The bankrupt had been employed for 5 years as a taxi driver earning a less than average income; he lived at home with his parents; he was single with no dependents. He was reluctant to leave secure employment in an effort to obtain employment related to his educational qualifications. Counsel for the objecting creditor argued that the bankrupt had a minimal income and had the capacity to make small payments toward his obligation. HELD: An absolute order of discharge was granted in accordance with the principles of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.,"Fulltext of judgment follows: After carefully considering the submissions and bearing in mind the objects and principles of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, I have reluctantly concluded that an absolute order of discharge is appropriate. HELD: The Court granted the bankrupt an absolute right of discharge with no order as to costs and an absolute discharge of $6,074.92. The trustee, on the other hand, recommends absolute discharge."

HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused was charged with four counts of impaired driving. As there was no evidence before the Court of the undertaking alleged in Counts 1 and 2, the accused was not guilty of those charges. The evidence of the officer was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as prerequisite to a breath demand. The accused testified that she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects of the alcohol until she arrived at the police station. HELD: The accused was found guilty of all counts. The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand and the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and 9 Charter Rights of the accused. As the breath specimen evidence was obtain as a result of a breach of s. 24(2) of the Criminal Code, it should be excluded under s24(2). The evidence did not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the police officer that the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court of Appeal concluded that the officer did have reasonable, probable grounds to make the breath demand and that the demand was not made forthwith or as soon as practicable and consequently, her rights under s8 and 9 of the Charter of Rights were breached. Therefore, the evidence does not support an honest honest belief the officer had on her as to whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the ASD demand."

Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2) For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The case was decided on the basis of credibility. The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused. The Court stated that, on all the evidence, it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged.","The defendant was charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations with use of a searchlight when hunting. HELD: The Court did not believe the evidence of the defendant and was not left in doubt by it. On all of the evidence, the Crown was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was using the searchlight for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The Court held that there was no evidence that he was looking for a moose, nor was there any evidence as to the precise time that it became dark on September 29, 2007, the first sighting of the vehicle by the surveillance aircraft was approximately 11:45 p.m. The trial proceeded on the basis of an Agreed Statement of Facts, filed as Exhibit P-1, and the production of five other exhibits.

b_1999skqb39.txt,HELD: The grandparents were granted access one Saturday every second month from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. It would be in the best interests of the child to have some ongoing relationship with both his maternal and paternal grandparents. The father lived in Alberta and may not be able to exercise the degree of access he was seeking. The relationships were separate with unique characteristics.,"The paternal grandparents sought an order granting access to their grandson R.D.G., born December 1995 pursuant to s. 6.1(1) of the Children's Law Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c. C-8.2. The material satisfies me that the applicants are responsible individuals who have genuine affection and concern for the child. While access should be less frequent than that which would be granted to the child's father, the grandparents have considered the oral arguments of counsel, the deposed material before the court and the authorities cited to me in this matter. HELD: 1 Saturday access period every two months would be appropriate under all of the circumstances and the respondent shall fix each access period two months in advance. The court was of the view that it would be in the best interests of the child to have some ongoing relationship with both his maternal grandparents, and his paternal grandparents."
3_2005nssc122.txt,"The 23 year old defendant pled guilty to two counts of breaking and entering a dwelling house and one count of breaking and entering a shed. He cooperated with the police and provided evidence against his co-accused. He had a previous criminal record, which included convictions for mischief, theft, break and enter, breach of an undertaking and possession of stolen goods. Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment; in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused.","The accused had previously entered guilty pleas to five counts of breaking and entering. The first count was that he broke into the complainant's residence and stole a large amount of property including some money and drugs. The second count, which was the third count, was that the accused had a Grade X education and that he had sporadic employment over his adult years at his employment as a labourer. HELD: The Crown had reduced the sentence to a term of four years and six months in a federal institution. A further reduction of one and one-half years would be justified.  1)The Court had the benefit of reading a pre-sentence report and hearing submissions by counsel. The Crown recommended that the sentence be increased or reduced to a period of six years incarceration. 2)A further credit should be given for the time already served which would amount to another 14 to 21 months."
7_2007skqb28.txt,"The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving while over.08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown appealed the acquittal on the charge. HELD: The Court held that the delay between the time the respondent was stopped and when the roadside screening demand was made took the demand outside of the 'forthwith' requirement of s. 254(2). The Court also held that because the accused was locked in the police vehicle, he was not informed of his rights to counsel until 17 minutes after the demand had been made. Therefore, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained Shire in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of Shire’s vehicle without arresting him, advising him, and/or permitting him to exit, was a violation of his Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis was conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s24(2) he did not make a screening device demand immediately."
2_2008nssm16.txt,"The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding.  Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","The plaintiff claimed $25,000 for damages for damage to the chimney base, which was under repair and the heavy rain would cause seepage in the furnace room. The disclosure statement did not disclose that the place had flooded in the past. The plaintiff alleged the Defendants had breached its contract with the plaintiff by misrepresentation in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement. HELD: The motion for non-suit was dismissed.  1)The court found that there was no sufficiency of evidence without weighing the evidence or evaluating its believability to see if the plaintiff has established a prima facie case or, as it is sometimes described, 'whether jury, properly instructed on the law could, on the facts adduced, find in favour of the plaintiff.' 2)The Court found that the plaintiff was not operating on a level playing field when facing an opposing counsel with a vast experience and law degree. It was necessary to allow the parties to present all the facts that can be proven in a court of law and to defend their position. 3)The plaintiff did not make out her claim as evidence of the necessary elements to prove the claims were not present. She did not suffer any damage due to any non-disclosure, misinformation or misrepresentation, nor was any damage casually connected to any act or omission of the Defendants."
e_1999canlii6888.txt,"The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales. The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by Lorne Putnam's company. The agreement only referred to Fluid Milk Quota and therefore, it was obligated to only share proceeds from the sale of Fluid milk Quota. The defendant alleged that the agreement only refers to the Fluid. The plaintiffs requested the equitable sharing of proceeds from sales of all quota sold pursuant to the agreement. HELD: The agreement was not interpreted to mean that if the defendant sold any of the milk quota which it held in 1987 prior to December 3lst, 2003, it would be obligated to divide the proceeds three ways. The plaintiff alleges that the agreements only refer to a Fluid product and therefore the agreement was only applicable to the sale. The parties agreed that the clause would apply to all milk quotas and not just Fluid, as the agreement provided for the sharing of the value of the quota."
e_2005skqb263.txt,"Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","HELD: The Crown sought to admit the two previous incidents of choking as similar fact evidence to prove issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. The defence argued that the'similar fact evidence' had not been overcome by its probative value and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial. There was a serious potential for moral prejudice as the accused threatened to kill the complainant if she did not drop the assault and sexual assault charges. The trial judge must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the evidence is extremely prejudicial in nature. It could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime."

In the end, the Court of Appeal Chambers judge decided that under New Brunswick practice, the inherent jurisdiction to add a party for the purposes of appealing should be exercised only by the Court, not the Chambers judge. HELD: The application was dismissed. Having considered the helpful briefs of counsel and the authorities, there is nothing in the material filed that would persuade the Court that a judge of the Court in Chambers does not have authority to make the order requested. Even if the Chambers Judge had jurisdiction to make an order, the order would be an order as, in my opinion, an application to the Family division for leave to terminate the permanent care ordered appeared likely to proceed.

In this matter, the defendant argued that the costs should be fixed at the amount actually recovered by the plaintiff.

The defendant submits that if costs are only awarded to the plaintiff, theAmount Involved should be limited to the actual recovery, namely the sum of $16,666.67.

The Court held that there was no final decision or judgment on any of the issues alleged by Granview to be the subject of an action in a quantum meruit under the Mechanics' Lien Act and that the application of CBCL ought to be granted. 1)The Court found that the two site evaluation reports prepared by Turf Masters were not provided to the plaintiff prior to the trial of the first action and that it was not possible to litigate the issue of the alleged site problems within the four corners of the original action. 2)It was not necessary to decide whether the claim should continue in the County Court as a result of the Mechanics', as it was then cast or on the Supreme Court of Canada. 3)The application was dismissed on the grounds that the Court had not considered the issues before it. 4)On the evidence of the affidavits and pleadings, it was clear that the applicant was considering all its legal remedies and avenues for relief for the non-disclosure of the site reports. It was also satisfied that to allow the applicant to now basically relitigate the same action on the same factual basis on a different legal concept would be an abuse of process of the court."

The Court found enough evidence to conclude that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that there was a breach of the implied condition that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard.

d_1991canlii2552.txt,"The appellant, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of a major international company, induced the respondent to enter a franchise agreement by making representations as to the viability of the venture. The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause. Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products. Prior to 1985 that activity, exclusively wholesale, was achieved through nation wide outlets leased from the appellant and operated by agents on commission basis. Those agents were not required to make personal investment nor were they financially responsible for the inventory. The appellant became concerned respecting its position in the market place. For example, the total revenue from sales for the Atlas agency at Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, had declined from $700,000 in the early 1980's to $450,000 during 1983-85. Before advertising for franchisees, the appellant was instructed to obtain a franchisee suitable to the appellant for Western Nova Scotia. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)It seemed to me that if the appellant had been open with the Guarantor and told him what Ritchie thought and what he expected, the deal would never have been completed. 2)It was clear from the outset that the appellant knew that the franchisee had no attention of spending his full time in respect to the franchise; that he did not have the resources to check out the accuracy of the Atlas projections. 3)The trial judge did not make any palpable and overriding error which affected his assessment of the facts.

Yellow Quill First Nation applied for intervenor status. The trial judge found, without giving reasons, that the project was a development as defined in the Environmental Assessment Act and the application for mandamus was adjourned sine die.

He was seeking damages against the federal government for alleged abuses suffered while attending an Indian Residential School. The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property. The mother was awarded costs of the application set at $350.","The parties have three children aged four to eight years. The respondent is involved in a litigation against the Government of Canada regarding alleged abuse he allegedly suffered while attending an Indian Residential School. The parties have been, for the most part, unemployed by reason of health problems and, as a result, arrears of child support are constantly accruing. HELD: In the event that the respondent receives damages from the Government, the first $50,000.00, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court so that the parties might speak to the distribution of same. The threshold to be met in such an application was simply that the disposition or wasting of the asset would impair or defeat claim under the Act. The court concluded in Anderson that it was not necessary to find predilection or intention on the part of the respondent to waste assets in order to issue an order under s. 8. When the respondent has only one asset that could reasonably become source of satisfying claim for the Act, not only his dependants, but society as a whole has an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used first and foremost for such purpose. If the asset is not available for claim, then it is society who will inevitably assume respondent's responsibility."
9_2006nssc379.txt,"The Minister sought numerous orders for production of medical and various other files (including the mother's complete medical files from her family physician, the Nova Scotia Hospital and another hospital, and her files from a woman's shelter and an addiction treatment and prevention service) in an ongoing child protection proceeding. The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.",The Minister sought 13 Orders of Production for records prepared by and in the possession of persons and organizations who had provided services to the Respondent. The Respondent consented to the grant of an order for the file and records of her treatment with E.F. her former counsellor. HELD: The documents were to be produced as part of the Minister’s protection proceeding and were not to be disclosed to the public. The Minister was not asked to balance right claimed by parent but was adjudicating claim put forward by the State. The documents sought are relevant because they are confidential. They are also relevant because the Minister must review its case plan on a regular basis.

2_2000skqb53.txt,"An appeal from Provincial Court on a Small Claim. The Jabours, the third parties who acquired title to the house, firmly bolted a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Abilities Council by anchor bolts in a concrete slab. The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift. San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land. It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty. The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs giving a claim for damages. The Provincial Court judge dismissed the claim against the third party, the Jabours, on the facts.","This was an appeal from a Provincial Court decision on a Small Claim. It involved the question of whether something affixed to a realty is fixture that passes with title to the realty. The respondents (third parties at trial) owned title to house property and caused a wheelchair lift to operate. The title was transferred to both them and the Abilities Council. The Abilities Council wanted the wheelchair lift back but San Diego negotiated purchase of the lift at depreciated value for a total of $2,769.29 for which she got judgment. The Jabours joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the claim made by San Diego. HELD: The appeal was dismissed both as it affects the plaintiff and the third party. The wheelchair lift never became part of the Realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of a property and the intention was a prime factor in determining whether something that is affixed is an encumbrant or a piece of property.

Furthermore, Kapronczai joined the Jabours as a third party claiming the claim against them. The Jambours claimed not to have known that the wheelchair lifted belonged to the Abilities council and to never have been informed of such. The trial judge did not accept the lawyer's denial that he and Tania knew that the chair lift belonged to it.

Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff, as litigation guardian of his four daughters, alleged that the defendant has wrongfully retained the sum of $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled. HELD: The plaintiff has been awarded judgment for breach of trust. 1) The written instructions of Mabel to Mabel constituted the establishment of a trust and that Brenda became the trustee.  2) An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely to make a transfer. 3) The instructions were given to Brenda. She apparently took them home with her. She stated that after she had read the notes Mabel did not instruct her orally to provide the cheques to the granddaughters. In 1992, Mabel requested that Brenda endorse three cheques in blank which could be given to the plaintiff if anything happened to her. The following Sunday, Pennefather died, before Royal Trust Company had completed the instructions by transferring the funds to the credit of the annuity contract of Daisy McIntyre. The plaintiff died in March 1998 at which time there was still $25,000 in the bank account in the joint names of Brenda and Wanda. 4) In McPherson v. L'Hirondelle, 1927 CanLII 48 (SCC), Newcombe J. for the court stated at p. 435-36: 'A complete voluntary transfer, which would not be a declaration if it appeared that there was an intention by a person to declare either a trust or a transfer, is not a form of trust.'  5) In McIntyre v. Royal Trust Co. (1946), [1946] W.W.R. 210 at 212 (Man. C.A.). Royal Trust had in its possession all of the share certificates of the defendant. The defendant placed $17,500 in the name of Brenda. Mabel placed $8,000.00 in the account a few years later. In 1995, Wanda's name was added to the account as joint owner. The funds were divided by the plaintiff's four grandchildren. 6) The plaintiff's wife and mother of the four grandchildren testified that she had taken the instructions home with them.

The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01. The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting. The Rentalsman's decision, made after reviewing pictures, repair bills and the statements of house cleaners, who indicated the hours worked and their hourly rate, was not patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the evidence.","The tenant appealed the Rentalsman's decision.

c_2009skqb514.txt,"FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600.","The mother has filed a motion in this matter requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the Gunn J. order. HELD: The father's income was to be determined on the basis of ongoing child support. 1) The father spent his severance funds on legal fees and to set up his new home in Alberta. For all of these reasons, the severance is included as part of the father’s income. The capital gain is a non-reoccurring amount which should not be included in the determination of his 2008 income. It is clear on the evidence before me that the father agreed, under the distribution of the family property between the parties, to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as a part of his family property division. This gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gain unless the father has gains on other property. 2) It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. The father is paying support on an income which have now determined to be the sum of $270,300. The son is working from the husband's income for 2007. At the time the order was made, the parties were working from their respective income. In light of the 2008 year was an extraordinary year for the father, it would be unfair to have the father continue to provide support on a basis of a severance package pay when the evidence is clear he will earn income of approximately $100,000 less than that amount."
3_1999canlii12258.txt,An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,"The appellant appealed an order which varied a child maintenance order. The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into about a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The judge thereupon decided not to allow evidence on all issues in dispute. She thought that evidence was required on only three issues. This decision gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant argued that he was denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. HELD: The appeal was set aside. The portion of the judgment relating to payments under s. 7(1)(f) of the Guidelines is set aside and the appeal is dismissed. There was no reversible error in the judge's decision, supported by written reasons, that the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within the Guidelines; the appellant's income should include the bonuses he received from his employer in 1996 and 1997, and (c) Mr. Elliott had no business based in the home. The last ground was that the judge erred in finding an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s. 17(6.2) of Divorce Act by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order, which contained special provisions to benefit the children. In all of the circumstances of this case, we can not see the appellant was deprived of the right of counsel on any issue and we must accordingly find the judge made no reversible errors. However, we do wish to be taken to approve of the procedure followed by the judge, and reaffirm the principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley (1996), 137 Sask. R. 295."

The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","This was an appeal from the Small Claims Court adjudicator's decision wherein he determined that he lacked jurisdiction to hear the action filed by the Claimants. The Claimants had commenced an action for breach of contract against the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench. The Alberta Court did not file a defence and the Respondent obtained default judgment for an amount not cited in either parties' submissions. Rather than determine a claim based on a fixed amount, it is apparent an Adjudicator, in a case of this nature, would be called upon first to settle a dispute regarding the original Court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract, and a factual dispute concerning attornment. Taking into account the purpose of the legislation, the remedial goals, the underlying values of efficiency and access to justice, and the potential for a complex fact finding process in this action, the present claim extends beyond the authority of the Small claims Court Act."

Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal.","The Union applies for leave to obtain intervener status as a party or as an intervener pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1) and to bring an appeal from orders made on September 23 and October 1, 1999, in proceedings brought by the Union against Persons Unnamed, Intended Defendant(s). The Union alleges that the Union is not a party to the proceedings as it is not joined as an amicus curiae or intervener by order of the Supreme Court. HELD: The Union does not have the status to file an appeal unless it is first joined in either of these two capacities as a result of the applications presently before the Court. The Union relies upon Rule 8.02(e)(i) of the Judicature Act which incorporated the ancient practice of the High Court of Chancery in England. Rule 62.35(e) was apparently not relied upon by counsel for the Union. It is convenient to deal with these applications by first considering the Union's request to be joined as a intervener, pursuant to Rule 7.05(e), and then as an interlocutor. Rule 7 is the rule governing interventions to this Court by persons who are interested in an appeal."

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care. HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period. JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court. This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs. The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. 3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time. KS has quit drinking. TK is now employed. KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction. The parents have a residence. TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health. DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time. TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children. The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser. The success of the involvement of DCR in the life of this family would be enhanced with the assignment of another worker.","The Department of Community Resources sought orders pursuant to The Child and Family Services Act placing the respondent with the Department until age 18, but in view of the respondent's stated intention to return to his parents' home on his 16th birthday, DCR sought an order placing him with his grandmother as a Person of Sufficient Interest pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The respondent did not attend the pre-trial or the trial although he and his girlfriend were cohabiting. He was served with the notice of the application, and the trial notice.

The Young Person was unrepresented and had no prior notice of the application. The Provincial Director had yet to consider conditions of supervision in light of the latest decision to make a continuation of custody application. HELD: The young person was released pending a full hearing.

The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing, that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record. In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial. As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","This was an appeal from a judgment in the Supreme Court dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia) ordering Future Inns to reinstate the individual respondents, to pay them compensation, and refusing to reconsider the first two orders. Other respondents were Hotel Employees Restaurant Employees International Union Local 662 (the Union). The Union had been organizing employees of the respondent in connection with an application for certification pursuant to the Trade Union Act. The individual complainants were dismissed from their employment because they were members of the Union. The respondent was attempting to intimidate its employees to compel them to refrain from being members of a trade union or participating in the activities of trade union. To mount an effective attack on the decision, given no more material than the facts of the offence and the length of the penal element, the prisoner has virtually no means of ascertaining whether this is an instance where the decision-making process has gone astray."
1990canlii2449.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","An unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old girl applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal social assistance. Her application was refused because she was under 19 years of age and was living with and being supported by her mother and stepfather. The Municipality indicated they were prepared to assist the parents with all of the extra expenses for food, clothing and any additional shelter expenses caused by the birth of their grandchild. The applicant's stepfather, who was the head of family and maintaining the household, opposed the application. Dismissing the appeal without costs, that although the provision allows the municipality to consider support for an unmarried mother pending birth, it is not mandatory but rather discretionary. In defining persons in need the committee must have regard to s. 19(e) of the Act and s. 1(m) and 2(1)(d) of Municipal Assistance Regulations."

Although the respondent signed promissory note and tendered cheque for $10,870 payable on September 30, 1996, he stopped payment of the same with claim of set-off being advanced.

b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault pursuant to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant. However, neither the accused nor the complainant, due to their respective self-induced states of intoxication, have any memory of the sexual intercourse that took place between them. HELD: The accused was found guilty. The Court of Appeal held that the defence of 'extreme drunkenness' was successful in the rarest of cases. It was difficult and sometimes dangerous for the accused to place much reliance on the evidence of witnesses, including complainants and accused persons, who come into court and testify about events that arose from drinking alcohol as a beverage or abusing drugs. The only defence raised by the accused was that he honestly believed he had the consent of the complainant to have sexual intercourse. This defence triggered the legislative response found in s. 33(2) of the Code. It is difficult to understand how someone who renders themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through the voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent."

He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges.

The accused applied for a review of the terms of his judicial interim release. HELD: The application was denied and the existing order stood.  1)In this case the picketing prohibition term imposed by the justice with the consent of the accused was reasonably-justified as a condition of release of him from custody.  2)If the amendment was granted as sought by the accused, there still remained a substantial likelihood he would commit a criminal offence or an act of interference with the administration of justice."

HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused, through his counsel, gave notice that he would be making an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under the Charter had been infringed and seeking remedy for that infringement. At the trial, Crown counsel called six witnesses to testify and during the course of the evidence of the sixth witness, the accused requested that the Court enter into a voir dire. The purpose of the voir net was to hear and determine an application by counsel for the accused for a finding that the rights of the accused under s. 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter were infringed. HELD: 1) There was no evidence to establish the accused did not speak to the complainant. The accused's continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a 'de facto' arrest as described in Latimer. There is no suggestion in the evidence before the accused that he misunderstood his actual status in any way, or that he was prejudiced by the 'unarrest'. The accused has not established he was the subject of a 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in a violation of his right to a free and fair trial.  2) The Court held that the initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported arrest, and continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station.

Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints.

Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","Counsel for the young person made an application under s. 132 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act requesting that the court exclude the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference scheduled for December 11, 2006. This case has attracted considerable media attention because of a concern raised by some as to the adequacy of government programs and support for the youth. HELD: The application was granted and the court ordered that the conference be held prior to the sentencing hearing. The court found that this was a public proceeding to which they should have access. It found that the public's interest was at the forefront of the discussions and that it would be in the best interests of society in the manner in which young persons in trouble with the law are dealt with."

This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first. The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years. The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income. In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement. At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent. The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income. This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support. The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement. The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent. The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support.","FIAT. The divorced husband applied to vary the spousal support provisions contained in a separation agreement dated June 18, 1975. The agreement provided for annual adjustments to the spouse amount payable based upon the increase in the Consumer Price Index. The respondent argued that the amount should now be paid pursuant to the terms of the agreement exceeded $1,000. HELD: The variation application was dismissed with costs to the respondent. The fact it has now occurred is not that kind of radical unforseen change required to be established upon the authorities to support the variation application. The retirement of the applicant and the reduction of his income as a consequence is reasonably foreseeable at the time the agreement was entered into. The wife's modest income provides any proper ground for variation. She still has a much lower standard of living than the applicant even after taking into account the amount she is receiving. In all the circumstances and for the reasons stated, variation application is dismissed with the respondent having costs to him. The husband had always earned a considerable income although he deposed to a number of substantial business investment losses in the United States. He had a holding company through which he had provided computer sales and consulting services, business he had substantially wound down and from which he expects little or no income this year and into the future. He has a locked-in pension with an asset value of $126,000 and house worth approximately $125,000 which he co-owns with the wife. He lives in modest apartment in the north end of Regina and drives a 1978 vehicle which is in need of repair."
e_1998canlii13558.txt,"The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy on the grounds that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and because his assets had been undervalued. He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants. The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy. The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy. HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. The onus will be on the bankrupt to comply with the requirements of the trustee to qualify for an automatic discharge on November 15/98 or an early discharge as provided for in s168.1(2).","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy. Section 181 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act reads as ""(1) Where in the opinion of the court, receiving order ought not to have been filed, the court may by order annul the bankruptcy."" The bankrupt asserts that the builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and can pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise ifthe home is sold and the proceeds divided among the claimants. The trustee maintains the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not effect the majority of his creditors, ie: those relating to the construction of his home. There are other actions by secured creditors returnable in Queen's Bench as early next week. The bankrupt has been far from model bankrupt. He has yet to file monthly financial statements and has not made payments as agreed to cover the costs of administration of the estate. HELD: The application by the bankrupt for an order annulling his assignment is dismissed. 1)The bankruptcy proceedings have been of no value to him. The majority of creditors, who are secured, would also benefit from the bankrupt's request being granted. If, as the bankrupt states, an annulment of the assignment would allow him to obtain financing it would likely result in these creditors being paid in full, much more expeditiously than it would otherwise take. Certain of the builders’ claimants have already commenced an action."
e_1999skqb151.txt,"The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed and the defendant was awarded costs on the basis of Column D of the Tariff of Costs. The issue was not plead in defence although the parties did canvass the circumstances within the framework of this summary trial, albeit without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference. It would be unjust to make any further order under the Act in these circumstances and in the absence of an evidentiary basis, for example, of the fair market value of the sprayer at the time of the seizure as required for an order under s. 55(c) of the Act.

c_2008skca28.txt,"The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer. The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit (Units and 6) from the respondent developer. It was the only planned unit in the downtown warehouse the developer proposed to convert to a 26 unit condominium complex. Building permits had not been obtained nor had condominium titles been raised at the time of sale. The appellant sold the unit to a third party purchaser at a cost of $25,000. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs. 1) Despite the manner in which the issues have been framed by the appellant, the preliminary question is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land. 2) The appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993, for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent. 3) The Chambers judge did not err in holding the agreement for the sale of the condominium was not in existence now and was unnecessary to address the issue whether specific performance was available. The issue of frustration was not before the Court in any event."

If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharge, it is also mandatory that the Court give reasons. The sentence is varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30.","HELD: The Crown appealed the sentence.

d_2012skqb237.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath.","This is an appeal from conviction in the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan that the appellant did, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to s255(1) and s253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge was in a position to test the credibility of the officer who made the demand for a sample of the appellant's breath. Even excluding the slurred speech and bloodshot eyes, the remaining indicia which the officer observed provide ample evidence to support her belief the appellant was operating his motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired. 2) The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument dealt only with the contention that the police officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to arrest him and to demand that he provide sample of his breath, thereby infringing his right under ss. and s. and of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule to the Canada Act 1982."
5_2007skpc74.txt,"Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was in a rollover accident and was intoxicated. The Crown appealed the decision following a voir dire on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer. The accused testified that after the rollover, he received a ride to Saskatoon with truck driver, who dropped him off near his cousin's home. While walking there he phoned his father, cousin and 9-1-1 operator. He received advice that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. He then went to the hospital to attend to his injuries. HELD: The accused's statements were self- incriminating and conscriptive. There was no violation of his Charter rights. The evidence obtained, the self-incriminating statements, that were made under compulsion of statute had been excluded. If the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self incriminating statements to the officer as a result of this belief, then the law requires him to exclude those statements. 1)The evidence obtained was self-initiative and self-recriminating and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. 2)The accused's statement about the accident and his rights to counsel and his right to counsel were not violated. 3)There was nothing to be said about the accused following up on those excluded statements. 4)On the other hand, the statements in particular were so incriminating that they must be excluded from the trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The admission would render the trial unfair if the accused's rights were violated. 5)The officer's admission would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions of the officer. 6)The Crown argued that if he accepted that the accused was given a police warning, then it would be clearly clear to him that he had not had a reasonable expectation that he would not be charged with a crime. 7)The defence argued that the evidence obtained by the officer was as the result of a breach of his section rights and that he understood the warning. 8)The Court held that the Crown was acting in good faith. The officer did not place the accused under arrest, give him a warning or make the blood demand. 9) The accused was co-operative throughout. 10)The police were instructed to exclude the statements that came about after the arrest, the warning and the demand for the blood. 11)It was not necessary to concentrate on the fact that the statements were made in"
7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not give a Vetrovec warning in relation to either witness. The pivotal evidence implicating the appellant in the murder of his common law spouse and friend came from the testimony of Susan Saxon and Dwight Windrum. The appellant's appellate counsel abandoned the ineffective counsel ground and proceeded solely with the argument that the trial judge had erred in law by failing to give the appellant a warning when the circumstances required one to be given. In his appeal to this Court, the appellant argues that the jury should have been able to rely on the appellant's expert opinion as to dangers inherent in his testimony. For the reasons that follow, the Court would dismiss the appellant’s appeal. 1) The appellant was found guilty of the second degree murder of Mr. Byer following a trial before a judge and jury. The evidence raised by the expert was not corroborated by the evidence at the scene. The testimony of the appellant and Windrum was not the only evidence that could be drawn from the expert evidence. The jury should be able to place reliance upon the evidence of Saxon, Windrum without guidance from the judge. 2) There was a fundamental misunderstanding of the strength of the ballistic and scientific evidence and the importance of the evidence to the Crown. The scientific evidence did not, contrary to the submissions of the Crown and the Crown, support the version of events given by the appellant. 3) The evidence was not found to be of any danger to the appellant, but rather that the appellant was exposed to the danger posed to the public by his testimony to both witnesses. 4) The court found that there was no error in law in giving the appellant warning. It was not an error to give a warning in the circumstances where it was necessary."
b_2004skqb105.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000. HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant.","FIAT: This is an application wherein the defendant, The Crossing Company Inc., seeks an order requiring the plaintiff to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The plaintiff contracted to build a pipeline for Interprovincial Pipelines Inc. in April 1998. In carrying out that contract the plaintiff engaged the defendant as a sub-contractor to construct a directionally drilled crossing under the South Saskatchewan River. The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, which is the other action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. HELD: The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of the Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for the costs of the defendant in the sum of $18,000 (assuming the counterclaim is wholly distinct from the claim). 1) The respondent commenced another separate and distinct action in January 1999. All matters arising out of the same motor vehicle accident and include all the parties involved in that accident. At least insofar as Saskatchewan Power Corporation is concerned, the party against whom an order for security for cost is sought is a party. However, if the respondent is successful in full or in part in its claim against the applicant as defendant, it would be entitled to set this off against anything the applicant recovered from it in his claim as plaintiff. 2) In the case of Speciality Steels, (supra), reference was made to the decisions in Athabasca Realty Co. Ltd. v. Lafontaine et al. (1981), 30 A.R. 581 (M) and Junction Engineering Ltd. (1993), 143 A.S. 316 (M). In the first there is an extensive review of decisions which discuss the issue of ordering security. It is important to look to the overall situation in order to decide what is just and fair. 3) There is no difference between the law in Ontario and the law of Alberta on this issue and in general terms the statement of Madam Justice Fraser is just as applicable to an Ontario case as an Alberta one. The second observation is that many of the costs will be related to the plaintiff's claim. 4) The plaintiff is called upon to defend the within action brought by the plaintiff. This is case where the plaintiff not only is non-resident party, but there is a real likelihood that it will be unable to pay costs if it is unsuccessful."

HELD: The accused was sentenced to 18 months in a provincial correctional institution. 1)It would be contrary to the administration of justice in view of the seriousness of the offence to allow the accused to serve his sentence within the community even though he appeared to satisfy the requirements of s.742.1(a) and (b) of the Code. There were numerous adverse impacts on the victim. 2)Mitigating circumstances included the absence of a criminal record; his abstinence from alcohol since the assault; the absence of penile penetration; his remorse and apology to the victim and to the court; his serious health problems; his ability to rehabilitate and the fact that he was a model citizen prior to the assault.","The accused was convicted of sexual assault. The Crown sought a sentence of 1/2 to years. They indicated there was no prior romantic connection between the victim and the accused, and that she pleaded with him not to do this. HELD: A non-custodial sentence was justified. 1)Having imposed a custodial sentence of less than 2 years, I must now deal with s.742.1 of the Criminal Code which permits the court to allow the accused to serve his term in the community. This section has just recently come into force. The accused refers to the new sections in the Code with respect to alternative measures of sentencing and requests that he be given a non-violent sentence.  2)The accused has no prior criminal record. His actions have affected him so gravely that he is on the verge of nervous breakdown. The defence claims the accused has abstained from alcohol and states he will never consume it again. 3)The sentence must be served in a provincial correctional centre. The victim is suffering from serious health problems. The sentence will seriously affect the accused's ability to rehabilitate."

The sole ground of appeal relates to the failure of the Provincial Court judge to advise the appellant of his rights to trial either in French or English pursuant to Section 530(3) contrary to the Criminal Law. The appellant's mother tongue is French and the fact that the trial judge did not advise him of his Rights to Trial in his own language is not procedural error.

The plaintiff sought an order under the Partition Act for the partition and sale of two properties owned jointly and a division of property owned by the defendant based on a constructive trust. The defendant owned and operated residential rental properties. The plaintiff, who had stopped working as a medical records technician in 1988, maintained the household and assisted in the business by answering phones, bookkeeping, showing apartments and helping with minor repairs. (1) that the plaintiff met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment by virtue of the plaintiff's contributions of time and money, namely (a) an enrichment, (b) a corresponding deprivation, and (c) the absence of any juristic reason for the enrichment. The proper remedy was an award of monetary damages representing 25% of the increase in the value of the defendant's assets during the relationship, not the imposition of a constructive trust; and (2) jointly held properties were to be sold pursuant to the Partition Act, unless the plaintiff elected to buy out the defendant's one half interest within 30 days.

The parties lived together for twelve years from 1975 to 1988. The plaintiff was the owner of a mobile home, furniture and car. The defendant owned four separate properties in their joint names, two of which were sold while they were still together. For most of the years they lived together, the plaintiff paid all of the household expenses with the exception of the $20 per week that the defendant contributed towards the food. For the four years the parties resided in the mobile home the plaintiff earned $17,409.00. In addition to the causal connection between the contribution and the property, the evidence must establish that the plaintiff, that is the person alleging the unjust enrichment, had a reasonable expectation of receiving an interest in the property and the defendant knew or ought to have known of this expectation. The constructive trust is one remedy which may be found appropriate when a finding of unjust enrichment is made. It is not defeated by the existence of a matrimonial relationship between the parties but, for the principle to succeed, the facts must display an enrichment, a corresponding deprivation, and the absence of any juristic reason 'for the enrichment'. The respondent has met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment."

It was also found, on a strong balance of probabilities, that the deceased intended to make an inter vivos gift to her daughter and, alternatively, that the evidence rebutted any presumption of resulting trust in favour of the deceased or her estate. Another of the deceased's children appealed. Appeal dismissed; the probate court judge did not misapprehend the evidence, lack an evidentiary basis for his findings, rely upon incorrect legal principles or fail to apply or misapply the law.","At issue in this appeal was the ownership of monies in a joint bank account in the names of the deceased and her children. The probate court judge found that even if his finding of an inter vivos gift was wrong, then 'certainly the evidence of the other witnesses and the documentary evidence rebutted any presumption of resulting trust in favour of the late Mrs. Scott or her estate.' He also ordered the respondent to pay costs against the estate. Appeal dismissed; the probate judge erred by making a determination when the evidence was not sufficient for him to do so and based only on speculation and hearsay rather than as required in law; and by not ruling on allegations of breach of trust and conflict of interest against the administratrix of the estate by the appellant. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Even if the evidence in the joint account was wrong (even if the finding was wrong), then the evidence (the signature card signed when the account was opened was not presented to the judge and neither the respondent nor the appellant produced signed documents showing that the deceased was entitled to the amount remaining in the account on the deceased's passing. 2)The probate Court judge did not err in his determination of ownership of the joint bank accounts. He did not misapprehend the evidence, lacked an evidentiary basis for his findings, relied upon incorrect legal principles, or failed to apply or misapplied the law. His decision dealt with a joint account and the presumption that the funds in it belonged to the deceased. 3)The court found no grounds for appellate intervention in this matter."

c_1998canlii12367.txt,"The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions. She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation. Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.","The Chambers judge was not convinced that the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. She noted at the beginning that she was not empowered to interfere with the decision of a board of arbitration unless it was 'patently unreasonable'. The resulting interpretation was not necessarily unreasonable, though this points in that direction. The conclusion respecting its unreasonableness must stand on its own, without being propped up by the reasonableness or correctness of the Pool interpretation or, for that matter, by its own wrongness."
5_2006skca7.txt,"This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","This was an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the respondent was subordinate to that of the R.M. mortgage even though the mortgage was registered before the mortgage of the respondent.

The appellant was seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and priority provisions of the LTA.  2) The Court of Appeal did not agree that by virtue of the filing of its caveat, the respondent obtained priority over the appellant by virtue only of prior registration. It relied substantially on the decision in Royal Trust Co. v. H.A. Roberts Group Ltd., 1995 CanLII 6094 (SK QB), [1995] W.W.R. 305. 3) It is not in this case necessary to consider whether the priority provisions are, as general rule, overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to covenant to postpone. 4) The appellant admits that the interest registered pursuant to subsection 53(1) is only effective according to the terms of the instrument or law on which the interest is based and is not deemed to be valid through registration. 5) In the present case, registration, while arguably conclusive on the issues of notice and priority, does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered.

8_2015skqb6.txt,"HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation. The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge. All accused were given an 18-month probation period to follow their incarceration. Terms of the probation included counselling as required and no contact with the victim.",HELD: The court found that the accused had entered guilty pleas to breaking and entering and committing the offence of assault causing bodily harm. The accused had not filed a victim impact statement with the court and were not overly co-operative with the Crown once they were out of custody.

They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.  , the file will be sealed. While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does. The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies. A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs. Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough. Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents). Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered.

They had done so after receiving a request from the media to examine that file. The media request was made according to the provisions of Civil Procedure Rule 59.60.

There is no publication ban of these proceedings. The public may attend the hearing, should there be one, and it may attend to hear any oral decision rendered or read the written decision.

b_2013skqb265.txt,"The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer. The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant. The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss.","The appellant landlord appeals a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer on the following two questions of law: 1) that the respondent misinterpreted ss. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Act in finding the tenancy agreement was not fixed-term agreement and 2) that a month-to-month tenancy would follow the primary fixed term negated a fixed term. The one-month notice provision referred to in the term of the lease was applicable only if the tenancy was extended to a month to month. The respondent vacated the unit on or about October 30, 2012. The monthly rental was $2100. The appellant did not attempt to rent the premises following his receipt of the notice, because he spent approximately $15,000 on furnishing the unit prior to re-renting it. He purchased a new tenant effective February 1, 2013 at $2500 per month, which was $400 more than when the apartment was unfurnished. The hearing officer concluded the tenant had not complained to the landlord about the noise was failure to mitigate, and that the one month notice provision was applicable.

b_2018skpc52.txt,"/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry. The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","The accused was charged with fishing for or for sustenance in violation of s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995, made pursuant to The Fisheries Act, 1995.

The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry.

It is an attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate a alibi by perjury. 2)His letter is direct evidence of his being at the Club the day before the robbery. 3)The adverse inference against the accused is that he attempted to induce the potential witness by perjury because he identified the accused in the photo ID line-up three and one-half months after the robbery, and is corroborated by the testimony of the other witness. 4)The letter admits fact which is against his interest. The adverse inference is that it is tantamount to an admission by the accused that he wasn't at the club the day the robbery took place. 5)The accused's letter is a direct result of his attempt to deceive the Crown into thinking he was the person who committed the robbery because the Crown had no other explanation for the robbery other than the fact that the accused was armed with a knife and that the Crown could not prove he was in the Club that night. 6)The only conclusion drawn from the letter was that the offence was committed to deceive and that it was motivated by a desire to deceive. 7)The evidence was not conclusive. The evidence was circumstantial. 8)The admissibility of the letter could not be drawn with mathematical certainty. 9)It is not a lie to lie. The Crown could never prove the robbery was carried out to the fullest extent of the criminal justice system. 10)There was no evidence to support the Crown's argument that the letter admitted fact which was against its interest."

HELD: Appeal allowed; s. 15(1) declared to be unconstitutional and of no force or effect; declaration suspended for twelve months per reasons for judgment of Flinn, J.A.; Glube, C.J.N.S. and Roscoe, JA. concurring. 1) The essence of being unmarried of not having contracted marriage in the manner recognized by the state in the sense of the federal Divorce Act is that it is an analogous ground upon which to base a claim of discrimination on the basis of one or more personal characteristics. It is not a matter which should be excluded from Charter consideration on the ground that its recognition would trivialize the equality guarantee. 2) The respondent was present during the hearing of this appeal but made no representations. Representations were made by the appellant and counsel for the provincial Crown."
c_2009skqb433.txt,"The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption. Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care. The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody. HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","HELD: 1) The Ministry sought an order under s.37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoption. Art and Laura opposed the application and petitioned the Court to return their grandsons to their care. The Court was of the view that an adoption plan is unlikely due to reasons such as the age of the child or other circumstances. Where the Court is of that view, it may make a long-term order placing the child in the custody of the Minister until the ages of 18.  2) The Court reviewed the issues affecting with the boys and the old file that dealt with Melody and her two sisters. It was concluded that the children did not pose a risk to the children."
c_2011skqb478.txt,"The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code. At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an Amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: possession of a controlled substance for the purposes of trafficking, possession of cocaine (marihuana) for the purpose of trafficking and possession of bodily substances (cocaine) for trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was also found to have a previous drug related record, had no disciplinary issues or problems while on remand and qualified, had he been in the regular prison population, for a one-third reduction in his sentence for the current offences. HELD: 1) The accused was given credit of one and one-half days for each day he spent in custody. The amount of money found in the trailer was part of the proceeds of crime found to be in his possession when he was arrested and of which he was being found guilty. 2) The court gave credit to the defence of the accused for his failure to provide and the Crown was authorized to take from him the number of samples of bodily substance reasonably required for a forensic DNA analysis. 3) In addition to the sentence of incarceration imposed, the accused was ordered to pay a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,325.98 to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, to the Crown. 4) The Court gave the accused credit of 6 months, 9 days, the same to be served unless otherwise permitted at a provincial correctional centre."
3_2004skqb379.txt,"FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","FIAT. The respondent applied to vary the support and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 consent judgment, which provided for the divorce of the petitioner and distribution of matrimonial property estate of the couple, as well as custody, access and support for the child of the marriage. The petitioner argued that the 1995 judgment was no longer appropriate and that the petitioner's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels the Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. HELD: The respondent's application was dismissed. 1)Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. The material change threshold has not been met. The existing access order allows the petitioner to define the extent of access or time spent with each of her parents. The title evidence would indicate that if such proceedings were instituted they did not conclude and the mortgage was paid out and the arrears of child support were cancelled. 2)The petitioner is now 15 and presumably all the wiser than she was two years ago. There is no evidence that she has spent more time with her father than she has with her mother. 3)The respondent is not a candidate for joint custody and shared parenting."
c_2003skqb197.txt,"The plaintiff brought a professional negligence claim against her former solicitors with respect to their handling of three charges against her for practising medicine without a licence and one charge for providing medical treatment, while not registered under the Medical Professions Act. The solicitors brought a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A. HELD: The motion for a non-suit was granted. The claim was dismissed. Although given an opportunity, the plaintiff failed to call expert evidence respecting the elements of negligence including the duty of care, standard of care, breach of the duty of care or causation. The solicitors were awarded one set of costs taxed on column 4.","This case involves a professional negligence claim being advanced by the plaintiff against her former solicitors, Michael Tochor and E. F. Anthony Merchant (as well as a related corporate defendant). The defendants were engaged and retained to represent the plaintiff as her lawyers in respect of four charges laid by the College of Physicians and Surgeons against her; three charges alleging she engaged in the practice of medicine and one charge that she provided medical treatment not being registered under the Medical Professions Act, 1981. She then commenced this action against her solicitors for negligence. She elected trial by judge and jury and to be self-represented. The trial began April 21, 2003. The plaintiff has been in possession of the defendants' notice to produce their intended expert legal witness and the nature of his intended testimony since December 2002 when the Notice of Expert Witness was served upon her. The jury has no evidence upon which they could possibly render a competent verdict upon the disparate facts relied upon by her in the evidence that she has presented. HELD: 1) The plaintiff was given every opportunity, if not encouragement, to call required experts. She chose not to do so.  2) The evidence, which if left uncontradicted, upon which a reasonable jury (i.e. trier of fact) properly instructed, could find negligence and causal connection between that negligence and the alleged injury and consequent damages. There is no expert evidence that has been presented by the plaintiffs to the jury to provide the jury with the competence to decide on this issue. 3) The court found that the standard of care that is applicable in professional negligence cases is a question of law and to that extent it is the responsibility of the trial judge to articulate that standard as part of the judge's charge. It is these matters along with Mr. Merchant's failure to personally conduct Ms. Palmer-Johnson's defence that constituted, in the main, the substantive basis for the plaintiff's negligence claim against the defendants."
d_2007skpc27.txt,"The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.","The Crown applied to have the complainant admitted into evidence oral statements made to her neighbour and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. Evidence was then called on voir dire. HELD: 1) Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met.  2) In the case at hand, it is clear that the complainant's evidence is important to the Crown's case and there is no other means of obtaining that evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way, she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. Accordingly, the court finds that the test of necessity has been met."
b_2002skqb250.txt,"FIAT. Saskatoon's daily newspaper applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing in the matter of R. v. Glen Ivor Jones on May 14, 2002. The journalists had no prior opportunity to hear its contents because Jones entered a guilty plea. The application was not opposed. The applicant sought an order for mandamus or a declaration. HELD: The presumption is in favour of public access to court records and the burden to contrary proof lies with the person who would deny access. This right is tempered by other factors (see R. v. SJS). Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General and playing the CD ROM and making their own notes balances the interests of innocent parties whose conversations were recorded.","FIAT. The Saskatoon daily newspaper applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing. The Crown had advised the applicant that it must apply to the appropriate court with notice to the Crown for an order to obtain access. HELD: The applicant was granted access. The court ordered an order for mandamus, or a declaration. The Court of Queen's Bench was the appropriate venue to obtain such relief. There was also an application by the respondent for a writ of mandamus. The applicant sought a declaration on the issue of access.  1)Both counsel agreed that the exhibit was now under the control of the Attorney General and was played for the sentencing judge. 2) The applicant's journalists had no prior opportunity to hear the contents of the CD in its sentencing submissions because the Crown entered a guilty plea. 3) The Attorney General did not oppose the application."
b_2017skqb308.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order committing a two-year-old child to the care of his maternal grandparents for an indefinite period of time. The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest. The child had lived with them since birth. The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change. These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.","HELD: In this proceeding, the Minister of Social Services seeks an order, pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the CFSA, that C.T. be committed to the care of A.R.'s parents for an indefinite period of time. The Minister also suggests a temporary order. The issues in this case are relatively straightforward and can be identified with two questions: 1) Is the child in need of protection? and 2) if so, what is the appropriate order to serve the child’s best interests. HELD: The Court found that the Minister’ s. 3, 4, 11 and 37 statements were not supported by the evidence. The Court also found that there was no evidence that the Ministry had been able to place a sufficient level of stability in the child, despite the fact that the child had been exposed to domestic violence and a severe domestic disharmony that was likely to result in physical or emotional harm to the child. The Ministry‘s position was clear. The child had a long history of drug use and had been involved in prostitution for several years. The father was charged with criminal harassment for failing to provide the minimum level of parenting required for the child to succeed."

HELD: The Court granted judgment for damages in the amount of $3,822 for necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning expenses and granted the counter-claim in the amount of $580 for unpaid work performed by the defendant and then applied setoff.

5_2000skqb565.txt,"FIAT. The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay. There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.","FIAT: An application for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing Count #1 of the indictment on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The Crown did not promise that it would be bound in its proceedings against the applicant by the findings of Klebuc J. in relation to the Schafer case. 2) It is common ground that the Crown takes the position that it is not bound by any factual or legal determinations made by the trial judge in Schafer. 3) The application raised substantively the same question as that previously considered and determined adversely to the applicant. The Crown relied on the assumption that it preferred to wait the outcome of the trial before proceeding with the Leibel trial. 4) In some cases, the Crown frankly concedes that it may appear to make findings favourable to Leibel but ordered the Crown to provide particulars (as it now has done in the amended indictment). However, once particulars were supplied, it would consider an application to order the indictment separated pursuant to ss. 590, if the accused could show that it was prejudicial to put the complex indictment to a jury."

The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation. The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him. Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G. The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer.","HELD: The Court of Appeal held that an information expanding the time particulars of the offence can be made at trial based upon evidence that indicates the offence may have been committed within the amended timeframe. The evidence did not provide precise information as to when construction of the greenhouses started and the currency in question was obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. The Court found that the accused were active participants in the marihuana grow operation and were in the possession for the purposes of trafficking. Based on the totality of the evidence, the only rational conclusion to be drawn in respect of the cash found in their residence is that it was obtained from the commission of an indictable offence in Canada."

This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act.

The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described.

The appellant's counsel argues that, without expert evidence called by the police to prove that it was not possible for Fleury to have swerved in such a manner to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to show the case. The Court cannot simply rely on his own experience to find that Fleury could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he told Cst. Poiré."

Three crown witnesses and five defence witnesses testified as to the altercation in the bar. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The self-defence argument was not accepted. Neither s.34 or s.37 of the Criminal Code justified the assault. 2)The testimony of the Crown witnesses was accepted. The complainant was no threat to the accused in his inebriated state and the accused took advantage of the situation to administer a beating to him. The injuries were not consistent with the scenario described by the accused and the witnesses.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm. The charge arises out of an altercation at Uncle Charlie's in which the accused subdued the patron with a headlock and removed him from the bar. The events surrounding the altercation were described by three Crown witnesses, and by five defence witnesses including the accused. The accused admits that he threw a punch but says he struck the complainant first. The complainant was employed as a doorman and relief bartender. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The accused did assault the complainant and did thereby cause bodily harm to him. 2)There was no evidence that the accused took advantage of the situation to administer a 'clear shot' to the complainant. Nor was there any evidence that he set himself on fire. Neither the accused's defence nor the complainant's defence was accepted. 3)The evidence was consistent with the accused being more aggressive than the Crown witnesses and that he was not trying to 'get at' the accused whilst being restrained by Layman. He may have thrown punch at the accused or attempted to do so, but his efforts were quite ineffectual. In his ininebriated state, he was no threat to the accused and that the 'accused in fact took advantage' the situation for a 'beating to him'. 4)The Crown did not accept the evidence of self-defence. Neither was the accused involved in the altercation with the complainant, nor was he trying to get at him. The evidence of the accused throwing a punch was not accepted by the Crown witness. The Crown did accept the defence's argument that the complainant threw a clear shot to prevent him from getting knocked out. 5)Although the accused was not the only person involved in this altercation, neither the defence nor complainant was he the only one who was involved in it."

Application dismissed; the accused had not met the onus on the balance of probabilities of establishing that the former Superintendent had relevant or material evidence to offer concerning the issues raised by the Charter motions. The subsequent testimony and documentation did not support the accused's allegations concerning the former Superintendent's motives or conduct.",The defendant was charged with three counts of fraud contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code relating to his activities as president and principal shareholder of a bankrupt corporation. He brought motions seeking a stay of those charges on the basis that his rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated by the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy (OSB) and by the R.C.M.P. during investigations of his activities and of the administration of the bankrupt company. The defendant argued that the evidence which had been given by the OSB during those investigations and the documents to which they referred raise issues which warrant compelling the defendant's attendance. The applicant dismissed the application. HELD: The defendant has not met the onus which rests upon him to satisfy the Court on the balance of probabilities that Mr. Redling has relevant or material evidence to give concerning the issues raised by the Charter Motions.

The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent. The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem. They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs. However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient.

9_2012skpc49.txt,"The accused plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault. The victims were his granddaughters. The assaults were alleged to have occurred between 1983 and 1991. A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts. The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim.

1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The court dismissed the plaintiff's claim for negligent misrepresentation and breach of trust. The plaintiff had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction from two mortgage brokers, which he acknowledged, requiring him to pay the mortgage brokerage and architectural fees from the next forthcoming mortgage advance from the mortgagees of the project. At the meeting, the plaintiff requested postponement of the mortgage advances in order that the funds may be diverted to other creditors. Dismissing the claim, that the plaintiffs have not established the basis for a claim under breach of trusts and cannot succeed on this ground. Any claim under this ground is dismissed."

The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","HELD: The Court found that a global sentence of 10 years was appropriate in this case to be served in a federal institution on the manslaughter conviction.

Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship.

Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court.

Romania is represented by the Attorney General for Canada. The applicant is a Roma and Romanian national who has resided in Canada since his arrival here exactly eight years ago. The Crown concedes that the applicant has met this low threshold. He is a Convention refugee. It is not my place to look behind that status on an application of this nature. In this case, the elevated risk of flight in light of the committal order, the respondent's failure to abide by a community-based sentence, the nature of the sentence and his desire not to be returned to Romania are important considerations. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1) The applicant's s. 43 submissions to the Minister are not frivolous.  2) Romania's submissions are well-argued and directed to the issues at hand. 3) Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings mean that must limit the assumption of risk of non-appearance in this case more severely than the Court would do in an application by an offender made directly under s. 7 of the Extradition Act."

A pre-trial was directed.","The wife sought an interim distribution of matrimonial property and interim support for her two children and an order prohibiting the husband from contacting her and going to her workplace. An interim order granted exclusive possession of the parties' farm home with the exception of the tool shed and other parts of the farm yard which the husband is required to enter for the purpose of farming. Both parties were ordered to have no contact with each other and the husband was ordered to pay $2,000 lump sum support for the children at the end of the 1994 harvest. HELD: The application was granted and the respondent was prohibited from contacting the applicant.

She now asked that she be paid half the value of the crop, $200 per month for each of the children, retroactive to July 1, and that the husband be denied the right to enter the tools shed and farm yard now that he is finished farming for the year. 2)The husband was found to have been collecting farm machinery and farm machinery since the date of the interim order. He had not offered any of the money earned to support his children. Any driving he had done was to help his son and drew no wages for it.

The plaintiff's claim dated back to 1984. The parties were not ready for trial. No prejudice was established.  3)The third party's liability, if any, will have to be determined on a case by case basis. Each individual action brought by a former student at the residential school is different in nature. 4)The applicant was granted costs of the application against the plaintiff and the First Nation.","The plaintiff alleges that the applicant, the Attorney General of Canada, as the employer of Starr, was responsible for his conduct. It applies to join the G[…] First Nation as a third party to the action brought by the plaintiff against it and Starr; so that it can claim contribution or indemnity from it if the applicant is found liable to the plaintiff. HELD: The application for leave under s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act and Rule 107A(c) of the Rules of Court is granted. 1) There may well be some delay by allowing the third party proceedings but it will not be inordinate. 2) The applicant has not established prejudice. Nor has the plaintiff established any prejudice. 3) Pre-trial was ordered by consent of the parties. The applicant had not exchanged documents and the plaintiff gave notice of his intention to amend his statement of claim after the consent order was granted. It was contemplated by the parties that if settlement was not achieved, further steps would be taken the parties agreed through correspondence that: ""Should settlement not be reached at pre-trial, either party may take any further necessary steps that such party deems necessary to prepare for trial..."". 4) The plaintiff's claim dates back to 1984; it can hardly be said any additional delay, due to third party proceeding, must necessarily result in dismissal of the application. 5) There is no evidence that the inherent delay is inordinate by allowing third parties proceedings. 6) The claim has a long history. It is not established that the plaintiff has established prejudice by allowing them. 7) The proposed third party claims it will suffer prejudice if it is joined as a party. There are many claims arising from alleged abuse at the residential school which could result in applications to join it as third party. The third party suggests it will incur large costs in defending these actions. It suggests it would be cost efficient and simpler to have the applicant sue it in one action to determine its liability, if any, to the applicant. Unfortunately, this is not solution to the problem. Each individual action brings by former student at a residential school is different in nature. It may cover a different time period and/or different employee so that the extent of the third parties' involvement will vary from case to case.

d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applies for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposes the application and requests summary trial. HELD: 1) The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as a bodyshop foreman and assistant manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. 2) The defendant put forward a realistic assessment of an appropriate notice period of seven months. Taking all factors into account, it seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures' the employment relationship.  3) The Court accepts the defendant's evidence wherever it conflicts with that of the plaintiff and still concludes the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. However, griping is not exactly unusual in a work place, and the type of conduct alleged against the plaintiff would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function."

The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charge. 1) The accused's vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot, and not at a fast or accelerating speed. The officer immediately applied his brake when he saw the accused, and immediately took steps both to assist the accused by asking if he required an ambulance and to have other officers attend at the scene. The accused did not swear at the officer and did not threaten to sue him and cause him to be fired from his employment. 2) The Court of Queen's Bench held that the accused's driving was careless. It held that, given the circumstances, he could not have reasonably concluded that a person would have been so close in front of him and that the officer did exercise due diligence. 3) The evidence of the police officer who was on duty at the time of the collision did not support the Crown's case. The Crown's evidence that neither seat belt, belonging to Mr. Tyndall or Mr. Rostotski, locked upon striking Mr. Kuchar, and that distance was at most one foot. Neither was waving their arms or giving any other cause for concern other than the officer's statement to his wife saying 'that vehicle could slow down' and the defendant did not appear to be waving his arms or give any other reason other than that he was asking the officer if he needed an ambulance. 4) There was inconsistency and conflict in the evidence given by the Crown and defence witnesses. The court was satisfied that the Crown had proved that the driving by the accused was careless on this charge. The Court held that it was open to the accused to prove that he exercised due diligence or took reasonable care."
b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","This appeal arises from an application for directions to determine whether Royal has an obligation to defend. On November 19, 1993, the appellant was involved in a motor vehicle accident. At the time of the accident, McLeod was on company business and was driving his wife's Honda because his company car had a deflated tire. At issue was whether the chambers judge erred in his determination of which insurer was obligated to defend the action because the Honda involved was not insured by Royal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided the issue of indemnity when he engaged in determination of whether the policy'might' provide coverage for that which is alleged in the pleadings. The chambers judge made no error and the appropriate scope of the inquiry was broader than that envisaged by the Court of Appeal. 2)The court was in a good position to interpret the meaning of 'insured' in clause 5(c) of the Act. However, it would be rare to find a case in which the insurer was under no duty to defend when the policy clearly did not provide coverage. 3)The Court of Queen's Bench judge found that the mere possibility that a claim advanced will fall within the coverage of the policy imposes a Royal duty."
d_2007skqb324.txt,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused applied for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant and the evidence ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). HELD: The accused's application was dismissed. 1)The evidence obtained pursuant to a valid authorization to intercept private communications was validly obtained and executed in a bona fide way and evidence of other offences gathered during the valid process was admissible. 2)There was no Charter breach. The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not violate the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. 3)The accused argued that the evidence was non-conscriptive evidence because there was no basis upon which he could conclude there were reasonable grounds to believe that information concerning the alleged offence would be obtained through the interception sought. 4)The respondent consented to have her private communications with the accused intercepted in order to assist the police in the investigation of the offences outlined above. 5)The Crown argued that because the wiretap evidence was obtained outside of the framework of the authorization, unless the Crown can prove the evidence would have inevitably been discovered, admission of that evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 6)The trial judge did admit that he had sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. However, after analyzing the provisions of the Criminal Code and the relevant case authorities, the evidence is in fact admissible and ought not to be exclusion."

The issues before the court is interim custody and primary residence of the child, access by the other parent and interim child maintenance. The parties filed evidence that was considerably contradictory relating to each other and respective abilities as parent. viva voce hearing was held to assist determining the questions of credibility. The mother aged 31 years of age, is employed as secretary. The mother remained at home during the first year of the child's birth then returned to work. The mother suffered from post partum depression following the child's birth and as result attempted to commit suicide. She was hospitalized for three weeks to receive psychiatric assistance. The psychiatrist who treated the mother states the mother is unlikely to have future suicide attempts and has responded well to treatment. The child was with the mother every afternoon during her hospitalization and the mother bonded with her son. The father is currently employed at Ipsco on shift work and is currently living with his parents. The father has had the child since the separation and the child has had little access with his mother. HELD: The child's primary residence should be with the mother. Based on the information before the Court, the mother has always been the primary caregiver of the child and remained at home with the child for the first year of his life.

The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT.

HELD: The Crown's position was that the witness was not adverse, but was now telling the truth after lying about certain matters in her statement. The statement did not meet the test for reliability set out in R. v. K.G.B. (1993), supra. The Court was not prepared to say that ipso facto the balance of the statement was unreliable."

b_2014skqb81.txt,"Limitation of Actions – Mortgage – Saskatchewan Farmland SecurityHELD: When s. 12 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act was enacted it was the legislature’s intention that a mortgagee, to whom The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act applied, could suspend the limitation period clock from running and after serving a notice of intention to enforce its security, provided that within three years of such service the mortgagee made application to the court for an order under s. 11 permitting it to commence an enforcement action. If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again. The notice of extension in this case expired in 2009 and the limitation clock began to run again. The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce the respondent’s mortgage has expired and the registration of the mortgage is ordered discharged.","The applicant asks that the registration of mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired. The respondent says the limitation time has not expired because The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, S.S. 1988-89, c. S.17.1 (the “Farm Security Act”) provides for a suspension of limitation time running while certain proceedings are underway pursuant to that Act. HELD: 1) The notice of extension having expired on February 28, 2009, the limitation clock began to run again. Given the expiration of the notice of intention on March 1, 2009 and the respondent’s failure to initiate any action, once the clock began running again it expired within the day. 2) The registration of the mortgage must be ordered discharged as requested for the reasons outlined in para. 13 above. The presumption in favour of ordinary meaning is rebutted by evidence derived from other statutory interpretation tools that another meaning was intended or is more appropriate in the circumstances. 3) The Limitations Act requires debtors and contractual obligees to commence enforcement proceedings within the applicable limitation period, failing which the right to enforce is lost."

Part of the order sought provided for the payment of solicitor fees by way of a contingency fee agreement negotiated with the applicant. The contingency fee agreement was never filed with the prothonotary. Granting the order relating to the settlement amount, but setting aside the contingency fee agreement, that Civil Procedure Rule 63.19(1) requires that all contingency fee agreements be filed with the prothonotary.

The bus pulled away suddenly causing some of the children to lose their balance. The infant fell to the ground and immediately felt the bus run over the lower half of his right leg. No surgery was required and the infant was advised to return to his pre-accident activities. The wording in Civil Procedure 63.19(1) requires that the filing of the Agreement with the Prothonotary is mandatory because of the use of the word'shall' and this was not done in this case.

9_2014skqb386.txt,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction, arguing that the roadside demand had not been made forthwith and that whether or not the accused had consumed beer within fifteen minutes of taking the roadside test was pure speculation. The trial judge found that the appellant rebutted the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) that the person who occupies the driver’s seat is deemed to have care or control of the vehicle. He found that even if he was wrong in concluding that the accused did not provide evidence to the contrary so as to rebut the presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, to stay the proceedings. HELD: The appeal was granted and a new trial ordered. The court found that, in the circumstances of the case, the appellant did not establish an abuse of process as a result of the fact there were three trials. The only thing the accused added to his viva voce evidence was the addition of the emergency brake, which would have to be released prior to the vehicle moving. This did not alter the fact that his vehicle was capable of almost immediate movement and as such, created the risk the section is designed to prevent."
d_2001nsca44.txt,"The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol. The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial. Finally, there were no errors by the judge on any of the other grounds advanced for appeal.","Following a trial in the Supreme Court, before Justice Simon MacDonald and a jury, the appellant was convicted of four offences under the Criminal Code arising out of her operation of a motor vehicle. The appellant appealed her conviction. Appeal dismissed; the appellant takes the position that the jury's verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The appellant appeals her conviction and raises numerous grounds of appeal. In none of these grounds does the appellant take the position the jury’s verdicts is unreasonable. The only evidence heard on this application is that of Constable Towle of the R.C.M.P. detachment. 2) The Court reviewed the evidence which the jury heard at this trial and found with the highest degree of probability that; 1) there was no mechanical defect in either vehicle that could have caused or contributed to the accident. 3) There was no evidence of impairment. The Court found that the appellant had not been drinking alcohol at all on the day of the accident and that there were no signs that she was impaired."
5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.",The students' union applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act pursuant to s. 222(d) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The students' Union sought to overturn that order. The Chambers judge dismissed the application and found that the president of the Students' Union had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge made errors in his approach to the application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals were dismissed with costs. The Court of Appeal held that the President of the Federation was a 'proper person' to bring the application. He attended the University from the fall of 2000 to the spring of 2006 and served as managing editor of the campus newspaper and served term as member of the Student Affairs Board. He was involved in the referendum campaign and a leading voice against joining the Federation. The Federation argued that the Chamber judge erred in finding that the student union had 'imposed its own preordained outcome' by endorsing the referendum result. The Chamber judge concluded that it was not necessary to transplant into the Act the case law developed in the context of elections for legislative office and to consider that body of law to be a controlling effect. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. The essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the student body's decision to reject the Federation's decision.
c_2005skqb166.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). An initial question was whether the trial judge's decision quoted above reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for impaired driving. HELD: The entry of a judicial stay on the.08 charge was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue. The trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment.  1) Absent expert testimony interpreting a particular reading, court cannot use the reading to come to conclusion as to what quantity of alcohol was consumed or what effect, vis-à-vis impairment, such consumption of alcohol had on the particular accused. The evidence as to the accused's pattern of driving, his unsteadiness and fumbling, coupled with his admissions and the odour of alcohol are matters which, if accepted by a properly instructed finder of facts, could have resulted in conviction. 2) There was no error in the judge's observation that the accused was the complete focus of Constable Coe's attention and could not see any unexplained delay."
4_1996canlii6841.txt,"The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Revenue and Financial Services Board reversed. Husky appealed under s. 21 of The Revenue and Finance Act. The issue raised by Husky on the appeal was the interpretation adopted by the Board of the word 'published' as used in s. 5(1)(b) of the Act. If, as the Board found, the purchase of the drawings was an independent transaction, was it exempt from tax by virtue of s. 8(2)(f) of The Act? 1)The Board determined as finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use in Saskatchewan and there was evidence before the Board upon which it was open to them to come to that conclusion. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly. 2)Husky appealed to the Board which upheld the assessment of sales tax. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the Board's definition or the broad interpretation. It is probably not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by HSU. The Board determined that an audience of one is sufficient. This eliminates having to focus upon whether the audience is sufficiently broad which as noted, is anomalous when one considers its application to a technical paper. The definition adopted does give rise to the artificiality noted earlier i.e. determining whether technical papers are produced, distributed or available to a sufficiently broad audience. The appeal is allowed.  2)The board determined that the word ""published"" was intended to speak to purpose and not the extent of the audience. There was no absence of evidence such that the Board could not reasonably reach the conclusion which it did. 3)If, as it was determined, the purchaser did not pay tax on what is referred to as 'Documentation charges', was it exempted from tax on an appeal of this nature?"
2011skca19.txt,"The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Court granted leave and allowed the appeal in judgment from the bench. HELD: The appeal was allowed orally. 1) The trial judge did not err in his reasons. He did not refer to the actual threat, if any, faced by the accused; (ii) the reasonableness of the accused's belief that he was being threatened; and (iii) the proportionality of his response. 2) The Court did not fall into the trap of preferring the evidence of one over the other, but rather drew conclusions regarding what happened based on the whole of the evidence. The Crown appealed. The court found that the trial judge erred in both ways. The appellant's reasons do not reflect an inconsistency. 3) While it is true that the appellant's mistake of fact was reasonable, he did not address the fact there were two officers present. He noted that Cst. Lariviere 'at no time felt endangered, and at no time took any steps such as pulling out his baton to deal with a dangerous or threatening situation', he noted that the force used by Cst.'Liere in reacting to the perceived threat had been justified. 4) The appeal judge found that even if the appellant had been afraid, he would not have rejected the defence of self-defence on the basis that the use of pepper spray was not proportionate response. 5) The court reviewed the evidence and concluded that the appeal judge had misinterpreted and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because it placed more weight on some portions of the record than others."
e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","This was an appeal by the City of Regina and Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) from a decision dated October 10, 2003, of Roger J. LePage, sitting as a Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The City and CUPE had met their duty to accommodate and accommodate Mr. Kivela as an employee of the City. The fact that the City was not prejudiced by the considerable time that has elapsed since the complaint took place. The requirement of building up seniority as a truck driver presented an insurmountable barrier for the petitioner because of his disability. 2) The tribunal erred in law in finding that the city had discriminated against the petitioner on the basis of being the person with the most seniority. There was no inference from the tribunal that the petitioner was being discriminated against. 3) The evidence showed that most of the casual employees who were hired as truck drivers in the City's jurisdiction (outside workers) did not have the physical capacity to work as truck driver. They were simply hired as temporary employees and then assigned to a tandem truck. 4) The respondent was awarded $8,902 for leaving his employment. 5) The court found that the tribunal was not in error in its decision to accommodate the petitioner."

It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that the officer should have made an effort to clarify the informational component of the right to counsel.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault, use or threatened use of weapon, unlawful possession of weapon and failure to comply with his recognizance of August 2, 2008, related to alcohol and weapon possession. The accused was given his Charter rights. He was advised of his right to contact counsel without delay and right to duty counsel. His response was muttered and hard to interpret but appeared to be that he was simply too drunk to understand the Charter caution given by the police officer. The Crown sought admission of the accused's inculpatory statements to the police officers. HELD: The accused's mind wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial and he was not focussed on the present and his immediate right to have counsel then and there. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty to make it impossible for the police to make a clarification such as, 'Brian, you have the right to counsel now before you make any statement to us.' 1) Access to counsel is the gateway of Charter rights particularly in these circumstances where this statement is the only evidence to be offered by the Crown in seeking conviction. 2) The accused exhibited a fundamental misunderstanding of his basic constitutional rights under s.10(b) of the Charter. The police would have been aware of the misunderstanding and as result, were required to clear up any misunderstanding the accused may have exhibited about his rights. 3) There was a low threshold here with respect to the degree of drunkenness, voluntariness and see no evidence of oppression, threats or promises at this juncture. The more important issue is the capacity of a person to understand their Charter right to be informed of their rights and to be able to call a lawyer. 4) The Court reviewed the video evidence and found that the accused was clearly and fully aware of his rights at the outset of the detention and that he chose not to avail himself of immediate counsel and made an informed decision to seek counsel of John Black when he went to court. The Court did not believe the accused wandered off from his fundamental fundamental right to get advice from counsel to make an informed choice about whether to exercise other rights."

All employees on staff at September 3, 1999 shall be eligible for retroactive wage adjustments based on all paid hours with any employer. The phrase in question was ambiguous and outlined the reasons why each of the competing interpretations might be chosen. The arbitrator concluded that the phrase 'any employer' in the context of this collective agreement is an unambiguous one.

3_1999skqb140.txt,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","This is an action by Redhead Equipment against Standard Transportation Services and Hyndman Transport (1972) Limited with respect to amounts owing for payments on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by the defendant.

HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The facts did not satisfy the Court on a balance of probabilities that this was an appropriate circumstance for an award in favour of the plaintiff based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.  2)There was no specific contract with regard to the repair of the leased vehicles. Although there was a specific contract between the parties, it was clear that the defendant did make some payments on behalf of Standard. There was no evidence that the repairs were authorized for Standard.  3)The plaintiff's claim was dismissed on the issue of the unpaid invoices. The plaintiff's evidence did not establish that either the defendant or the defendant had notice of the payments, or that there had been a misapprehension by Standard's creditors. The evidence of Duda was that the payments were made either under the direction of Bennett or for work that was done where a specific purchase order number was supplied. 4)Costs were also dismissed. The Court was not satisfied that the facts of this case satisfied the Court. The facts of the matter do not satisfy it on a balanced of probabilities. The defendant had an obligation to the plaintiff, Redhead, either in contract or equity for the lease payments on the vehicles and for the repairs to them for the period from September 1, 1993, until February 11, 1994. The actions taken by both the defendant and the plaintiff were taken for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational. It would be unjust not to make an award. 5)The defendant was prepared to assume a risk to the arrangement because of Standard's insolvency and that Redhead might not be paid on its trucking contracts.  6)The Court was clear from Cox's notes and Duda's evidence at trial that it was understood by the parties that the obligation to make the lease payment would be contingent on Standard's ability to make money on its trucks. 7)The evidence of Cox and on review of the documents themselves was not conclusive. 8)The court was clear in Cox's evidence that he did not know how the repairs had been authorized. 9)The defendants were not liable for any liability."

e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","HELD: The court found that the holding of trial was a more efficient and cheaper method of coming to conclusion regarding the issue of maintenance than ongoing negotiation or pre-trial. The court ordered that the respondent father be responsible for 56 percent of s. expenses, which, by agreement of the parties consist of non-subsidized childcare and any health and medical costs in excess of $100 per annum. The petitioner and the respondent were ordered to provide the other with copies of their income tax returns, including all schedules and partnership statements, no later than June 15, 2007 and by the same date in each year thereafter. The Court found that in 2003, 2004 and 2005 the income of the father was $29,983 and that if he had overpaid child maintenance to this date, he may offset the overpayment against future maintenance payments but only to the extent of $50 per month so that the maintenance actually paid will not drop below $518.00 per month."

An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention. Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs. It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","FIAT. The defendant was in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for trust funds. Additional information demanded by the defendant could be obtained through production orders against third parties but also through belated efforts by Bawolin.

It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction.

They were both serving their “life” or “eligible” sentences and had been charged with the disciplinary offence of being in a housing unit other than his own. HELD: The application was granted. The Court’s jurisdiction to grant remedies against federal institutions and decision-makers is narrow. It is not for this Court to determine the reasonableness of the correctional services of Canada within the confines of its jurisdiction. Habeas corpus cannot be used to review the decision of the Correctional Services of Canada declining a housing reassignment request or the policy that all inmates found in their own prison will be subject to disciplinary charges. While the applicants were seeking to challenge administrative decisions of the prison service which do not impact their residual liberty, these remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process."
d_1991canlii4237.txt,"In this divorce action the petitioner sought to have a separation agreement entered into by the parties incorporated into the corollary relief judgment. The respondent sought to have the separation agreement set aside on the grounds of duress, undue influence or unconscionsability. The couple had a traditional marriage. The petitioner earned $48,000 per year. The wife did not work outside the home and suffered from severe arthritis. For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","The parties entered into a separation agreement which provided for the maintenance of their matrimonial home. The husband contended that the agreement was unconscionable, unduly harsh and fraudulent. The wife sought an order setting aside the separation agreement so as to increase the maintenance provision and at the same time retain the asset division in her favor. Both parties acknowledge that the maintenance award is of such a low amount that it is unconscusable and unnecessary to vary the terms of the contract or agreement as the court has confirmed to them that it was not made for taking into account the almost inevitable costs of disposition."

The trial was to be held before a jury.HELD: 1)The Court has a general discretion as to severance of issues which must be exercised judicially. 2)Severance should only be ordered when the judge has a serious reason to believe that the trial of the issue proposed to be severed will put an end to the action. 3)The Court accepted the Plaintiff's submission that expert medical evidence would be necessary to establish the cause of the accident since the Plaintiff had suffered brain damage and would be unable to testify. This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found. 4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages. A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues. 5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case.","This was an application by the defendants for an order pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction severing the issues of liability and damages. Dismissing the application would result in the plaintiffs being disentitled from their right to have a jury decide what is the appropriate quantum of damages.

8_2008nssc358.txt,"The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally. Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","The former wife sought to vary the child support terms of the Corollary Relief Judgment. She argued that her RRSP income should not be considered when calculating child support. She also asked the Court to review the amount of child support paid by the Respondent going back to when the parties first separated and asked that he be ordered to pay any deficiency between what he did pay and what he should have paid. The previous variation order was a consent order and both parties agreed to its terms. The order was approved by the Court and was not appealed. There were, however, changes of circumstances since the granting of the last variation order and the Court was not asked to change the method or formula used by the parties and their original agreement, nor to retroactively vary the terms of that order."

2010skpc153.txt,"The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations. The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.","At the close of the Crown's case, defence brought a Charter application challenging the constitutionality of s. 35 of The Fisheries Act, 1994, alleging it breaches s. 11(1) and 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. HELD: There was no prohibition order in effect within s. 27 of the Fisheries Act. The Crown had conceded that the accused was not a member of the Executive Council. There was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused’s licence and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a licence at the relevant times. The issue was whether the accused had the authority under s. 13(4) to revoke a licence because of a specific conviction. The accused was never properly served. Nor was he served by registered mail, in which case it would take effect on the delivery date or on the date the signed post office receipt is returned to the sender. The prohibition is not personal service by any definition.  1)The Minister of Environment was not the person charged with the offence of exceeding the angling limit. He acted in compliance with that licence and there was no valid section 27 revocation or prohibition in place so far. 2)The prohibition takes effect at the date of the letter being received. 3)The accused was neither properly served nor served personally nor by registration mail. He was served by a registered mail in which he would have no authority to act on behalf of the Minister.  4)The Court found that the Minister was not properly served and that the prohibition was void ab initio, having been made without authority. Section 27 does not give the Minister the power to revoke when a person contravenes the Fisheries Regulations. The Court found there was a prohibition order within the meaning of ss. 27 and s. 8 of the Act."

b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary an order for maintenance for her daughters. She also applied for determination that the father was in arrears of maintenance and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted, does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The quality of the parent/child relationship by itself rarely determines the matter. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Even if the circumstances as a whole were construed as a unilateral withdrawal by the daughters, the high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been found to be unilateral, unjustifiable and is clearly wrong.  2) The Court found that the issues in this appeal can be reduced to the following: 1) Was there an agreement in 1997 to pay specified or other maintenance? 2) Was the father in arrepentant and is retroactive maintenance payable to September 2006? 3. Were the daughters 'children of the marriage' within the meaning of the Divorce Act? The Court held that the trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding the daughters were not in deficit of support and that there would be no order for retroactive support."

The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work.","Reliable Truck Trailer, a mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company, entered into an oral agreement with Super Save Disposal (Saskatchewan) Inc., hereafter referred to as 'Super Save'), in which it agreed to provide, on a 'call out' basis, repair services for Super Save's fleet of trucks.

HELD: The bankrupt was granted an absolute discharge by virtue of s. 172(2) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. 1) The bankrupt failed to produce proper records and to assist the trustee to the fullest. More generally, he reports that he has been abusive and belligerent.  2) He should be able to comply with the conditional order in the amount of $8,000 in addition to surplus income. 3) Having carefully considered all of the facts, the existence of multiple s. 173(1)(a) grounds, Burroughs' personal circumstance and his ability to pay, the Court readily found that s.173(2)(d) does not apply to the bankrupt. The bankrupt's actions in the five years prior to bankruptcy did not constitute an acceptable period of time for a bankrupt to be burdened with a conditional order.  4) It would be unfair and unjust to allow the bankrupt to receive his discharge without making a sizeable contribution to his creditors.

e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The chambers judge did not make a palpable and overriding error nor did he err in law and his conclusion was supported by the evidence before him. There was no basis to interfere with the decision of the judge. The court found that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to pay proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of s. 7(1)(f) of the Guidelines.

c_2002skqb508.txt,"A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of food services at the University of Saskatchewan. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties failed. The employer advised the Board that it was not prepared to make the agreement retroactive. The Board refused to sign a contract or implement it and sought clarification of the retroactivity of the wage rates. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)The employer was a merchant. His products were priced in such a way as to reflect in part the labour costs involved in delivering them to the public. The decision to allow the graduated employees to receive their back pay was not patently unreasonable in that it denied the parties natural justice and procedural fairness in respect to the wage retroactivity to employees who had left the employ before the contract was concluded by order of the Board. 2)The issue of retroactivity was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions and arguments and would not have been easily ignored. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would have been rather meaningless. 3)The decision was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice."

At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed.

8_2006skqb274.txt,"DIGEST The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000. HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit. 3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","The appellants were convicted by a provincial court judge of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act, S.C. 1990, c.21 (the “Act”) and the “Health of Animals Regulations” resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors.

The appellants appealed the sentence on the basis that the fines were too harsh and the consecutive sentences exceeded the overall capability of the offender to pay. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s.734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed. 2)The sentencing judge did not take Alsager's rehabilitation into consideration. Given the need for deterrence in a public welfare statute, he cannot find that the sentence was “demonstrably unfit”. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit."
b_2004skqb156.txt,"The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle. There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3) Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The appellant is a non-earner as defined by the Act who was involved in a motor vehicle accident on July 25, 1998 and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as skidder operator.

HELD: 1) The Income Replacement Benefit must reflect a claimant's earning reality. His earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time. The IRB ought to be calculated accordingly. 2) SGI's evidence that his operation continues in inclement weather is accepted. The issue is determining the time that Montgrand would have actually been employed and that finding has been made. 3) The provisions of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations, s. 117 and s.115 indicate legislative intent to have the Insurance Benefits Board reflect the earning reality by providing for a reduction of the calculation in certain circumstances such as those in which the claimant is capable of part-time work. Section 116(1)(a) and s115 require that the Income Replacement benefit be calculated based solely on wages calculated at $17 per hour for 60 hours per week for the entire 180 day period.

6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","This is a divorce proceeding between the parties. The parties began cohabitating in 2001 and separated less than one year later. They have a child, Ella, born April 2004. The parenting and support issues concerning Ella have been resolved. The issue for the Court is whether Tristen is a 'child of the marriage' as defined by the Divorce Act (and if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). HELD: The threshold for a finding of parental status is high and reserved for these cases where a step-parent can be clearly shown to have assumed the role of the natural parent in substantial substitution for the one who is in the place of parent. This was an important decision - Mr. Delorey did not'stand in place of a parent' when this decision was made. He stood, or was stood, aside."
4_2010skqb193.txt,"The litigation revolved around a claim by the plaintiffs for damages that resulted from a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006. In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery. HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence. Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery. In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery. The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars.","FIAT: The plaintiffs were operating a tractor unit bearing Manitoba licence plates and pulling semi-trailer bearing an Alberta licence plate. The tractor was owned by an Alberta company and the plaintiffs, presumably husband and wife, were at all material times residents of the Province of Alberta. On the 22nd day of August 2004, the plaintiffs were involved in a head on collision on a highway in Saskatchewan. The plaintiff sustained a right leg injury, lacerations, back injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. The defendant auto insurers of each of the three provinces are named defendants. Saskatchewan, at all times, was governed by a no-fault insurance regime. The plaintiffs' statement of claim accords with Rule 139 and goes, perhaps as far in particularity as the state of health of the plaintiff, who is still under treatment for her injuries and special damages for same as such are not now fully ascertainable. Both the first and second reasons just stated have merit. The defendants are entitled to this information, at a minimum, before discovery and the defendants may require their own medical examinations of this plaintiff by request to the plaintiff or court. Rule 164 enables a party, after delivery of the initial pleadings of the opponent, to demand better particulars and disclosure of documents. This Rule contains at least two major purposes: first, to assess the merits of settlement discussions; and secondly, to properly prepare for discovery. In this particular case, both the defendants right to deliver notice in writing to the plaintiffs requiring the plaintiffs to provide, 'a further and better statement of the nature of their claim... and, better particulars of any matter of which particulars should properly be given and such notices shall clearly state the particulars required.' Unlike Rule 139, which has as its main purpose the provision of sufficient particulars to enable a defendant to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiffs' claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence, Rule 164 has a different, but similar, scope. Rules 164 and Rule 164 enable a party to demand the same, but smaller, amount of documents in greater detail then mandated by Rule 139."
5_2002skqb378.txt,"All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.","The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that [J.C.M.] provide to the petitioners copies of his tax returns for 1999, 2000 and 2001 and his notices of assessment for 2001 and 2002. The parties have been unable to reach an agreement with respect to child support and accordingly have proceeded to trial. Retroactive child support should be fixed at $1,500 with costs to be paid within 10 days of receiving the receipts. HELD: 1)The court found that the child care expenses incurred in this case did not meet the requirements set out in s. 7(1)(a) of the Family Maintenance Act and accordingly were not warranted. 2)The respondent's income for child support purposes was $35,269.44 and he was ordered to pay 59% of the costs of his music program commencing in September 2002 and continuing on the 15th day of each month thereafter to December 15, 2003 at which time retroactive s7 expenses are warranted. 3)Reasons for retroactive order [QMLA 393]Rule 608(2) of Queen's Bench Rules provides that costs are in the discretion of the court. In this case ongoing support was not an issue. The main issues related to the s. expenses and the retroactive support order were mixed and as such there was no order as to costs."

The receiver manager of the registered owner (the numbered company) under the Bankruptcy Act and the instrument appointed receiver on behalf of the secured creditor and mortgagee (HSBC Bank) applied for a vesting order. The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year. HELD: The vesting order was granted. 1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so. In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87. 2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor. The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment.","FIAT. The applicant applied for a vesting order under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, 1985, c. B-3 and an instrument appointed receiver of the registered owner on behalf of the HSBC Bank, a secured creditor and mortgagee of certain real property of the Registered Owner applies for an order with respect to a sale of the real property. HELD: The application was granted.  1)The jurisdiction formerly granted to the court by s. 87 of the Land Titles Act, s. 1978, cL-5 not brought forward in the new land titles, 2000, S.S. 2000, C.L. and in particular Regulation 6.5 dealing with vesting orders. 2)The material satisfies that there are no other interests that will be adversely affected if the order is granted. No subsequent encumbrancers, competing creditors nor the Registered owner's rights respecting redemption or preservation of equity (there is none) are adversely affected by the order."
2_1999canlii12455.txt,"The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support. Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The primary issue between the parties is custody of their four children. Ancillary to and dependent upon determination of the custody issue is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party. Matrimonial property owned by the parties at the time of separation has largely been divided between them to their mutual satisfaction, with the exception of few items to be dealt with by way of court order. HELD: 1) The uncontradicted evidence indicated that the most important consideration for the children now is stability. That stability is found in their father's home. The children have the most stability and where they receive the most structure and support in their educational endeavours. The court must take into consideration only the best interests of the children as determined by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of those children. The Court must also look at the increased costs of shared custody (9(b)) and any extraordinary expenses which are relevant (9). 2) In making an order for custody pursuant to s. 8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act, the court must also take into account only the interests and needs of the parties. The child support awarded by s. 9(b) contemplates broad discretion in determining the proper award. 3) It is in the children's best interests that they be in the joint custody of [C.O.] and [K.O.' and that they reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. There is no evidence that the children will suffer from language difficulties as a result of sharing custody. 4) There was no evidence of any other reason why the children should reside primarily with the petitioner. The petitioner was not persuaded that it was in their best interests to be removed from an environment that offers them the stability that they require nor from the specialized educational opportunities available to them in Saskatoon. 5) It was also in their parents' best interests for them to reside in each of their parent's homes. 6) The children were exposed to the negative influence of the father's behaviour towards the children. 7) The respondent was not aware that there were three schools in Clareshorn, a town of 4,500 to 5,000 people. The evidence would be at best an estimate of the future cost of the new arrangement and necessarily lacking in precision."
c_2016skqb269.txt,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","The accused was charged with failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee by failing to instruct the employee on how to unplug a receiving pit. The employee died shortly after entering the pit. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The mass of material emphasized the dangers, and the importance of following the safety procedures, rather than burying them. The fact that the employee suffered serious injury at work is evidence that the appellant did not ensure his health or safety. The Court of Appeal's approval of these remarks does not accept the Crown's position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proves the actus reus of failing to protect an employee. The accused must prove beyond reasonable doubt that a prima facie breach of the duty of care has occurred. Once it does that, will the onus shift to the accused to show on balance of probabilities that he showed due diligence or took reasonable care."
c_2011nssc20.txt,"The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson. They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","The plaintiffs were injured in a single vehicle accident while passengers in a vehicle driven by the other plaintiff. Both were paid damages for the injuries they sustained. The amount paid to each of the plaintiffs was acknowledged in writing and they each signed a release acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. HELD: The motion for summary judgment was granted and the claims of both the plaintiffs were dismissed. The parties should not now expect to be compensated further, particularly where to pursue a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. To allow their action to proceed would be an abuse of this Court's process. 1) There are no genuine issues of material fact requiring a trial. What facts are in dispute only pertain to the claim made by the plaintiff, Maria Johansson. 2) The defendant, GMCL, has passed the initial hurdle leaving it to the other two plaintiffs to establish, on the facts that are not in dispute, that their claim has a real chance of success. They have failed to do so. 3) Both “Fraser River” conditions are satisfied and GMCL should be entitled to use the Releases to defend against the two plaintiffs who have already been compensated for their injuries by Citadel. The plaintiff has failed to pass the first hurdle of presenting its case. 4) The parties have not proven that there is an inherent defect in the design and manufacture of the vehicle involved. The only issue that could result is whether the parties intend to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on the contractual provision. In short, the parties to the contract intended to extend benefits in question only pertained to the plaintiff. They failed to establish this genuine issue for trial. 5) The defendants are entitled to summary judgment, dismissing the claims made by both the plaintiff and the defendant. 6) The plaintiff is entitled to seek contribution from her and her insurer should the defendant be allowed to proceed with their claims."
1999skqb29.txt,"In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","FIAT: The applicants seek an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development, including the subject bylaw, and from further considering an application for a discretionary use permit by Kathy and Gary Palidwar for a private hotel development connected with the community facility known as the Evergreen Centre.

The proposal was not disclosed for two weeks. The Town Council has taken certain steps to bring the proposal to fruition. These include tentative sale of public lands and the introduction of Bylaw 756/99. The applicants are opposed to the development and take exception to what has transpired to this point. 2)The Town Council acted unreasonably and arbitrarily and without the degree of fairness, openness, and impartiality required of municipal government. The proposed hotel would be connected to an existing public facility. This project has been strictly confidential to the applicants. 3)The applicant is a hotelier who operates 5 of the 6 hotel and motel properties within the Town's boundaries.

2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","The applicant municipality appealed its decision to strike its claim under Civil Procedure Rule 14.25(1)(a) of the Constitution Act, 1982, arguing that the federal government had breached its obligation to provide equalization funds to the province. The applicant municipality sought a declaration that the province had breached s. 36 of the Act. The court struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. HELD: Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. 1)The court found that the respondent municipality's pleadings disclosed a reasonable cause. The Court found that pursuant to Civil Procedure rule 14.24 the respondent's proposed interpretation of s.36 was not justiciable. 2)The respondent municipality was not in breach of its constitutional commitments. 3)The Court held that, in the context of this appeal, the Court of Appeal should not be hesitant to strike such claims. 4)The issue for the Chambers judge was whether pursuant to the Civil Procedure Rules s.14.25, the appellant municipality's plea did not disclose any reasonable cause for action. It concluded that they did not. 5)The appeal was therefore a generalized expression of dissatisfaction respecting the province's failure to take appropriate steps to alleviate this disparity."

Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done. Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable. An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties.","This was an action by the plaintiffs for damages for breach of contract or in the alternative claim for unjust enrichment and/or quantum meruit. There was an oral agreement for the payment of a fixed commission between the parties. There were definite terms and an award of unjust enrichment was made to compensate for work done. HELD: 1) The court found that there was no evidence of oral agreement or oral agreement. The court was satisfied that the oral agreement was enforceable but in the absence of an enforceable agreement, the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the Defendants based upon quantum meruits or unjust enrichment.  2) There was no indication that the commission structure was negotiable. 3) The Court found that the defendant had not indicated that he intended to re-negotiate the terms of the agreement. 4) The issue of the 10% commission was not raised in the discussions with the plaintiffs. Rather, the issue was whether there was any oral agreement and if so, what was the appropriate amount."
e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court granted the respondent interim primary residence and an equal division of family home and property. The Court found the petitioner's Federal Child Support Guidelines income to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support for D.K. in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal and child support of $5,250.00 per month."

A reasonable cause of action is disclosed. 2) None of the affidavits filed speak to the circumstance wherein the impugned remarks were made. Most importantly, there is no assertion by the defendant that the remarks were made in the course of her duties or were received by persons with a corresponding duty.","FIAT: This is an application for an order striking out the plaintiff's claim in defamation. The application is brought pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173. The Court may at any stage of an action order any pleading or any part thereof to be struck out, on the ground that it discloses no reasonable cause of action, as the case may be, and the quoted test has not been met. HELD: 1) While several affidavits were filed, none of them spoke to the circumstances wherein the impugned remarks were made. Most importantly, there is no assertion by the defendant that the remarks are made in the course of her duties or were received by persons with a corresponding duty. That being so, a reasonable cause is disclosed and the quote test is not met.  2) The plaintiff must establish that the words spoken or written were published on lawful occasion, that is one 'fairly warranted by some reasonable occasion or exigency' and that there must be some mutuality of interest or a reciprocal of interest between the publisher and recipient. Reciprocal of interest is essential. It must be shown that the publisher had some duty or interest in making the communication, and those to whom it was made had some interest in receiving it, or at least he or she was acting on behalf of someone who had such an interest. The statement of claim alleges malice. The claim lacks substance and merely serves to scandalize and annoy the defendant. 3) There may be merit to the defendant's claim but it cannot be dealt with in this application. The affidavits filed by several individuals, including the defendant purportedly filed would not constitute defamation in law even if proven to be true. The plaintiff fails to plead the means by which the statements were made or the dates when, and locations where they were made, and deprives the defendant of the ability to address the applicable limitation period. 4) The statements of claim is scandalous, frivolous and vexatious and otherwise an abuse of process."

The plaintiff was to apply for the permit, as it was the signage expert. Although approval was never received, the sign was delivered and installed. The message centre was never activated, although the equipment was in place at the defendant's warehouse.

The plaintiff was aware that no permit had been issued by the Department of Transportation and that there was opposition to the use of the sign by the defendant. The defendant was aware of the situation from the beginning and took advantage of the benefit for some 74 months, which would indicate total rental of $64,750. The alternative claim put forth by the plaintiff was dismissed without costs to any party."
7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the credit union held a security interest. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) It would have been improper for Gari to deny permission to remove the Building unless the credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. That stance would have conflicted with the regime established pursuant to the PPSA. The Credit Union took the position that it should be re-imbursed either as Quantum Meruit or because it has been unjustly enriched or because the payment of property taxes has created a constructive trust of the $6,227.88 in Gari. 2) In order to resolve this appeal it is necessary to consider the priority provisions of s. 36 of the Personal Property Safety Act. The trial judge found in favour of Gari for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. As a result, Gari’s claims in this regard must fail. 3) It is common ground that Gari was seeking security for possible damage caused by removal of the Building but was not seeking rent and reimbursement for taxes paid. If that issue is decided in favour, it will also be necessary to look at the merits of the specific claims advanced by Gari against the bank."
2_2011skqb102.txt,"The Crown appealed the respondent's acquittal on a charge of driving over .08. The Crown alleged that the trial judge erred in law by excluding two breath samples taken following the respondent's arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights. During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence. HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case. The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects.","The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent on the charge of impaired driving on the basis that two breath samples taken after the arrest of him were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The learned trial judge failed to consider the contradictory evidence available to the police officer in forming the objective grounds for the demand sufficient to require additional objective information, such as an objective and subjective component. The existence of reasonable and probable grounds entails neither an objective or subjective component and the issue was not pursued at the hearing of this appeal.  2) The trial judge erred in attempting to balance the observations of the officer which tended to indicate that the accused was impaired by juxtaposing them against other observations which would indicate normalcy. The officer made no note of improper driving when she first observed the pickup truck, nor when she pursued it and it pulled over to stop. Defence counsel had given verbal notice of Charter issue at prior appearance but elected not to seek voir dire.

d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","The accused was found guilty of conspiring with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 465(1) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46, and trafficking in steroids only.

During the course of the trial, Crown counsel disclosed the existence of approximately 1,900 documents. The accused applied for a new trial on the basis of the discovery of the documents and alleged a breach of s. 11(d). The trial judge granted the adjournment and granted the application. The court reviewed the documents in detail and found that there were 27 additional documents not previously disclosed in the combined forces database that could have affected the accused’s right to make full answer and defence.

d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.","The plaintiffs were in a motor vehicle accident. The defendant was operating a police vehicle at the time of the accident. At the time, the plaintiffs were living in common law relationship and they had spent the evening hours visiting various bars and pubs in celebration of birthdays of relatives. The plaintiffs were travelling at a high rate of speed when they were struck by the defendant's police vehicle, which was stationary at the intersection. The defendants claimed the headlights were not in operation when it approached the intersection and that the plaintiff was contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. The plaintiff was driving directly through the intersection on a green light and the police vehicle was approaching the intersection when it turned, without signal light in operation, in front of the plaintiff's vehicle. HELD: The plaintiffs claim the defendant was not qualified to express an opinion.  1) The evidence of the lay witnesses convinced me he was in the field in which it is sought to have the witness’ opinion. 2) The Court found that up to the time the motor vehicle collision was occurring, the defendant’s headlights were in operation on the plaintiff vehicle and the plaintiffs’ vehicle was burned out. 3) There was not presented evidence which established the officer was capable of expressing his opinion in his own capacity. 4) The court found that the exhibits were in “near perfect condition” which would be sufficient for an opinion in this case. 5) There were no issues with the destruction of the exhibits.

2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","HELD: The respondent was awarded judgment for $1,945. The petitioner had some assets which could be shared but her share would only be $2,000.00 or so as he was quick to claim exemption for his own house, which they never lived in, and all of the assets which he had before the marriage. Five of the children lived with her in the home. The matrimonial home was divided equally between the parties already and direct no further division or appraisal of those properties. There was an accrual to Edward's pension during the period between the marriage and the application date of May 21, 1998 valued at $8,358.00 for a total of $9,890.00. There were certain personal property, vehicles, etc. which were subject to income tax and the petitioner assumed debts of almost $5,000 which must be credited to him, leaving a credit to the petitioner of $1.945 for the total. The court accepted the claim that the petitioner's house, jointly owned with his mother as protection 'in case he meets someone' is exempt property. HELD: There was a judgment in favour of the petitioner and an award for costs of $4,000 plus an award of $5k for the sum of $6,000 to be awarded to the respondent.  1)It was, prior to the 21 month marriage, the long term family home of Sharon Lang and her 10 children all born of a previous marriage. 5 of those children live with her. Such a division would mean that Edward Lang for his 21 month involvement in the family was being given one-half of the only asset the family has. They would either have to assume a large mortgage or move out of their modest $60,000 home to a far more modest home or to rental accommodation. 2)The respondent was employed by the public school system and had a permanent job. He had the prospect of an inheritance from his mother, a good pension, his own home with no mortgage and in short no financial problems. He would be even better off if he were to award the $25,000 against the property."
b_1990canlii4176.txt,"This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff had worked for 28 years for the defendant as a driver making deliveries to customers. The defendant dismissed the plaintiff for 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The plaintiff had taken longer coffee and lunch breaks than were allowed, and had taken unauthorized breaks for which he had then been paid overtime by the defendant. For the defendant, that the dismissal was justified. The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules.","The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as a driver and driver's helper. He was dismissed from his employment without notice. The plaintiff contended that his hours of work were 7:15 a.m. to 3:45 p.m., that he was under surveillance and that he took longer than authorized breaks, consumed alcohol during the work day and submitted claims for overtime which were unjustified and basically dishonest. The court found that the defendant was justified in dismissing the plaintiff for his failure to abide by the company's overtime policy. HELD: The plaintiff's dismissal was justified and the plaintiff's claim for damages for wrongful dismissal was dismissed. 1)There was no reasonable excuse for the dismissal of the plaintiff. The failure to distribute the rules, in writing, in this particular case, is crucial. The onus is on the defendant to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for dismissal. 2)The breach of company rules is serious. The implications of breaking the rules in question are sufficiently serious to justify termination; and whether a reasonable excuse exists. 3)The defendant's failure to comply with company policy related to breaks and overtime is a cause for discharge. It is apparent from the testimony of the drivers who testified that they regularly stopped at the Seabreeze Inn during their Hubbards route to pick up merchandise and to unpack it for the customer. There was no evidence that the employees had been warned that they would be terminated if a rule was breached. 4)The plaintiff's employment was terminated without notice in 1988. The defendant has satisfied the onus with respect to six of the factors."
5_2011nssc53.txt,"A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","The father sought party and party costs against his son. The central issue in the father's application was not about the meaning of his mother's will but about the gift of a condominium held jointly by his parents. The father contended that his mother made a gift to him that failed. He sought to have his solicitor and client costs paid out of the estate. Alternatively, he sought party costs. Allowing the application and ordering costs in favour of the father, who is now acting on his own, will bear their own costs. HELD: The court ordered the parties' costs to be paid out.  1) The court did not award costs against the father.  2) The purpose of an award of costs is to provide the successful party with partial but substantial indemnity against legal fees measured by what would ordinarily be charged to client for the kind of work undertaken on behalf of a successful party in the actual case. 3) There is a public interest in ensuring that the executors of a deceased's estate are required to stand by their 1999 will, including the provision of the condominium to his son, which was not 'estate litigation' but rather litigation between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them."
b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","The plaintiff claims his personal and professional reputation has been seriously damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. HELD: The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. The plaintiff has proven that he was defamed. However, the defendants have accepted the defendants' defence of qualified privilege. 1) The plaintiff was the director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) and was an active participant in the harassment himself. 2) The court found that the plaintiff had not been defamed but had been a victim of the impugned wording of the plaintiff's grievance. 3) There is no basis for jurisdictional defence."

The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal. Objections to the admissiblilty of the accused's statements based upon the Charter raise a different issue and considerations from the application of common law principles and a different conclusion may have been reached.","The appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.

Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","The accused was 19 years old at the time of the accident and lived in the city. He was charged with dangerous driving causing death. The Crown argued that a sentence in the lower end of the range is one which should be imposed and that such a sentence should be a conditional sentence to be served in the community rather than in a corrections facility. HELD: The accused was sentenced to 90 days in the Provincial Correctional Centre. 1)The Court was concerned with the principles of general deterrence, denunciation, rehabilitation and rehabilitation of the accused. 2)The accused's actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his failure to pay attention to the situation resulted in the death of his passenger. 3)The Crown sought a sentence of imprisonment for 90 days and an 18 month term for probation.  4)A troubling factor in this instance arises from the fact that the accused was driving a motor vehicle on the streets of the City of Regina in a manner dangerous to the public. The Court was of the view that sentencing guidelines should be set out in s.742.1 of the Criminal Code."
9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The defendants applied for an order severing the plaintiffs' claim between liability and damages. The plaintiffs alleged that Wolff, along with Sparks, set up a competing business through their corporation, Advance-Tek Consulting, to compete against the plaintiffs in the scientific research and experimental development (SR&ED) grants from the Canada Revenue Agency. Wolff was bound by a confidentiality and non-competition agreement with the defendants. By sharing this information with the other defendants, Wolff has breached that agreement and his contract of employment. HELD: The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages was dismissed. 1)The defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality and disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain their position in the business of SR&ED consulting. 2)The plaintiffs' counterclaim against the defendants and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 3)The court reviewed the Queen's Bench Rules and granted the order to strike these portions of the claim.  4)The Court considered the impact of disclosure on a settlement between the parties. The court found that the plaintiffs’ application had merit. It was appropriate to exercise their discretion in their favour and grant the order. 5)The defendant’s application to strike portions of its claim was dismissed because there was a clear severability between the threshold of liability and the consequential issue of damages."
d_2016skpc19.txt,"HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with accessing and sharing child pornography. The accused was a member of the Internet Child Exploitation Unit (ICE) Unit. The ICE unit was involved in the investigation of the accused. HELD: The Court found that the accused had in his possession child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(4.1) of the Criminal Code. A search warrant was issued and the accused was taken into custody. During the course of his investigation, the accused requested an opportunity to consult with counsel. The first officer testified that he was certain that the Internet traffic was destined only for the red tower computer and that the physical MAC address of his computer was G.U.I.D. The second officer testified as to how the system could be used to identify packets of information. The third officer testified about how the Internet could be a bridge between two networks. He testified that there was an encryption system used to access the Internet, specifically at least one computer that was encrypted with a program called True Crypt. He also testified that it was possible for the Internet to be accessed by someone accessing the same server, the same Internet address and obtaining the same information from the same physical location. The search warrant authorized the search of the entire duplex. The only thing that could be done was to look at the physical address and name of the person who was accessing the Internet and to see if there was any evidence of child pornography on the Internet. The Court concluded that the evidence of the third officer was insufficient to conclude that the second officer was a computer expert."
7_2013skqb67.txt,"The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","The parties attended a settlement meeting and reached an agreement on seven issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit, including Exhibit A. The petitioner did not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and suggested it should terminate June 27, 2013. HELD: 1) The respondent was to pay child support of $1,213 per month commencing September 1, 2012 and payable on the first of each month thereafter. 2) The parties did not reach agreement on all issues. There was no agreement that any agreements reached at the meeting could not be used in evidence. If the division of family property was not settled by June 27th, either party may seek to have the issue of continued possession reviewed upon 14 days notice. 3) The petitioner was to receive interim spousal support in the amount of $500.00 per month for the first two months and $400.00 for the third month. 4) The Court concluded from the material before it that while the parties may have reached agreement on a number of issues, they failed to reach an interim exclusive possession of the family home. The Court directed the Local Registrar to remove Exhibit A from the court file. 5) The court concluded that the policy considerations which underly settlement privilege and as identified in Tucker-Lester require that unless all of the issues have been resolved, privilege continues to extend to those issues where there may have been a consensus unless there is a clear understanding and agreement that once one of these issues is resolved it is off the table and considered to be settled irrespective of what may happen with respect to other issues that may exist as between the parties."
a_1995canlii4000.txt,"The Appellant/Defendant, Bennett appealed a judgment resulting from a jury trial. At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings. The Respondent/Plaintiff cross-appealed on the issue of whether the trial judge should have directed the jury to deduct sick leave benefits from her past loss of income. Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","Following a jury trial of this action for damages for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile collision, a judgment was pronounced awarding damages of $409,251.18 to the respondent. The appellant appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Expert evidence is admissible provided that the expert is qualified and his or her testimony is necessary or useful to assist the jury in making factual determinations. 2) Although the appellant made the calculations in P-16, we cannot characterize his testimony as 'expert opinion' evidence in this case. 3) The trial judge should have specifically directed the jury on the limited purpose for which the expert's testimony could be used as well as the weight that might be given to it. Accordingly, the tabulation was not objectionable because similar calculations could have been made by counsel or the trial judge. 4) The appellant limits her challenge to the 'future loss of earnings' component in the amount of $337,130."

He argued the youth court judge erred in concluding statements made to the police were made voluntarily. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that both the appellant's sister and girlfriend gave evidence of inducements by the police to the accused to admit to the alleged crimes, in return for a lighter sentence. The trial judge failed to address this evidence, thereby committing a palpable and overriding error.","The appellant was convicted of nine charges of break and enter and one charge of assault. During the course of giving the statements, the appellant's sister, who was his girlfriend, raised the issue of whether or not the statements taken from him by the R.C.M.P. Detachment were voluntary statements and the Youth Court judge erred in finding that the statements had been taken in compliance with s. 56 of the Young Offenders Act. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial was ordered. The failure by the trial judge to make any finding with respect to this issue was a palpable and overriding error. The statement given to police officer is only admissible if it is voluntary. Evidence of a similar nature was given by the appellant\'s girlfriend. The trial judge did not make any findings of fact or determinations of credibility."
e_2001nssc162.txt,"The defendant made an addition to single family residence. Following a dispute between the parties as to whether the defendant's use of the property now complied with the plaintiff's land-use bylaw for a single family residence, a consent order was issued dealing with the structure of the property and how it would be used. The plaintiff sought a finding that the defendant was in contempt of the consent order, seeking enforcement of the provisions of the consent order and an order that the defendant pay a fine. Defendant found in contempt of consent order; fine ordered in the amount of $10,000; if defendant has not complied with the terms of the consent order by January 31, 2002, the Sheriff is ordered to enter the property and receive the rents, profits and income thereof until the defendant clears his contempt; the door and hardware between the original structure and the addition is be removed; any references to separate apartments are to be removed from the property; the second power meter is to be removed from the property and the second cable television connection and associated billing provisions are to be eliminated; the defendant is to provide within 15 days the names of all tenants and if and when there are changes in any of the tenants, he must provide the plaintiff with the particulars of the new and remaining tenants; all tenants must be notified in writing prior to entry of occupation that the entire structure and building is only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit; copies of any written leases are to be provided to the plaintiff within 15 days of their execution; the plaintiff can enter the premises for the purposes of random inspection on a bi-monthly basis until the plaintiff is satisfied that this Order has been complied with and thereafter, the plaintiff is entitled to inspect the premises at random once a month while the defendant remains the owner of the property; the fine will not be crystallized into a judgment and execution if the defendant complies fully with all the requirements of this order on or before January 1, 2002. The plaintiff is entitled to solicitor-client costs.","HELD: The court found that the defendant was in contempt of court for failing to comply with a Consent Order issued January 9, 2001. The defendant was ordered to provide a copy of the lease to the plaintiff and to advise any and all tenants in writing that the entire structure and building was only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit. The second power meter must be removed from the premises and the second cable television connection and associated billing provisions were to be eliminated.

2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to clause 15.10 of the lease quashed. The lease was amended and then assigned to Loblaws Properties. The tenant vacated the premises and the Landlord sought to quash the award. HELD: The arbitrator was not correct in concluding that he had authority to award damages. That is beyond the scope of the arbitration clause because it is not dispute about the clauses or provisions of a lease. There is no jurisdiction to resolve a claim such as this which arises from a Landlord/Tenant relationship itself and not the clauses and provisions of the leased lease. The principles of waiver and estoppel apply as against the Tenants. 1) The standard of review is correctness with respect to the interpretation of the clauses in the lease and the amount of damages. 2) It is not patently unreasonable for an arbitrator to rely upon the actions and statements of others to his detriment. 3) The arbitration clause under the lease is a limited arbitration clause. It does not provide that all disputes between the parties are to be settled by arbitration, but only disputes with regard to clauses of the leases. However, the decision of a consensual arbitrator must give to those clauses an interpretation the language will reasonably bear. If the interpretation is not, the award is immune from judicial review. 4) It would be inequitable for strict rights to be upheld where there is an error going to jurisdiction, judicial review is the proper remedy. 5) There was no evidence that the Supreme Court of Canada intended the widened scope of judicial review to include an award of damages to the Tenant. The court reviewed the cases and concluded that it was not necessary for the court to interfere with the award because it was within the jurisdiction of the tribunal. The Court reviewed the issues of responsibility for repairs, whether the loss was covered by insurance and whether notification or claim was required and whether insurance should have covered the damage. 6) The Court concluded that the arbitration clause was a limited arbitrator and that it did not provide a jurisdiction to deal with disputes arising out of the landlord/tenant relationship but only those disputes involving the clauses. 7) It was not appropriate for the Court to intervene if there was an error in law. 8) There is a wide scope for curial deference and for judicial restraint in the determination of whether the award would withstand judicial review, but there is a limitation on the amount and scope of jurisdiction."
c_1999canlii12484.txt,"In issue was whether the law firm was in a conflict of interest with respect to two matrimonial files and whether the firm could remain as counsel for the spouses. HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux. The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm. At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes. She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses. 2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case. There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening. Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her. The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet. The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter. The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.","This is an application for a determination as to whether the law firm of Olive, Waller, Zinkhan & Waller is in a position of conflict of interest with respect to the matrimonial files of Magnes v.

e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to ss. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with operating while his blood alcohol content exceeded.08 contrary to s. 253(2) and with driving while impaired by.08 with a blood alcohol concentration of.08 in excess of 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The Court found that the accused's admission of impairment was reasonable and that the Court was not obliged to rule out every other possible cause. The Court concluded that there was no breach of s. 8 or s. 9 of the Charter and the Certificate of Analysis was therefore admissible. 1) There was no dispute that the officer's belief was honestly held and subjectively valid. 2) The absence of any smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption of beverage alcohol did not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving demonstrated by the accused and the very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest the officer reasonably could have only a mere suspicion that he had alcohol in his body. 3) The Court held that the grounds upon which the demand was based cannot be said to be objectively reasonable, the detention was arbitrary, the breath samples unlawfully seized and therefore, the evidence thus obtained should be excluded pursuant to s24(2). 4) It is the Court's view that the driving irregularities and the physical symptoms of the accused in this case paint a virtual stereotypic portrait of a motorist impaired by the alcohol. The officer was not asked more questions or conducted more thorough investigation, nor did he have any other explanation for his actions.  5) The court found that it was reasonable to conclude that the most obvious cause was impairment by alcohol.  6) An assessment based on this criteria would also favour the admission of the evidence.  7) It was not necessary for the Court to terminate the investigation. 8) The officer's reasonable grounds for arrest and for the breath demand were objectively sustainable.  9) The presence of any indicia commonly found in impaired drivers does not necessarily undermine finding of reasonable and probable grounds based on the observed indicia and available information viewed in totality."
4_1998canlii13643.txt,"The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the decision of an adjudicator made following a hearing pursuant to s. 62.1 and 62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts, as he found that Cajon, as the appellant's employer, had an obligation to attempt to resolve a matter of work difficulties that had prevented her from reporting to work.  2)Cajon acted well within its jurisdiction when determining what the terms of Ms. Kovach's employment contract were and that the appellant had not frustrated or fundamentally broken her employment contract. 3)The Court found that the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding that Cajaon,as the appellant, had not breached its employment contract, had acted within its obligation to permit its employees access to the workplace. 4)Although not all of the facts presented to the Court were known to this Court, his decision outlines some evidence upon which he could have arrived at his conclusions. The doctrine of frustration cannot be applied to the circumstances of this case."
6_2002nsca46.txt,"The plaintiff appealed an interlocutory decision in which the chambers judge held that a non-party medical doctor who had provided emergency treatment to the plaintiff did not have to answer certain interrogatories on the basis that they required an opinion. The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial. Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given. Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided. However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided. Interrogatories cannot be used to usurp the Rules surrounding the use of expert evidence.","The appellant applied for leave to appeal and, if granted, to appeal the interlocutory order refusing to appoint Dr. Miller a court expert and refusing to order him to answer certain interrogatories, the majority of which call for his opinion concerning the medical services provided by the respondent, another physician, to the appellant. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed in part as provided. 1)The detail required by this Rule ensures the factual basis of the expert's opinion is clear to the trier of fact who will have to assess the weight to give the opinion taking into account and ensures adequate notice to the parties of experts opinions to avoid surprise and help them discover the truth. This rule also provides specifically for discoveries of experts and their reimbursement. 2)To allow interrogatories to usurp this function, without the presence of such safeguards for the parties, the experts and the court, would not be in accordance with the orderly and fair trial practice and procedure that the Civil Procedure Rules promote. 3)The details required by the Rule ensure the factual and emotional impact of an opinion on the subject matter of the action. 4)The appellant is entitled to have these answered, even if this requires the doctor to disclose the opinions that went into the formation of his judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant during this period of time. The appellant is also entitled to answer interrogatories seeking to determine his opinion at the time he treated the appellant as to what would have happened if he had not treated him as he did. 5)The chambers judge considered this issue of opinion and I am satisfied he erred by overstating the basis upon which a non-party witness may object to answer an interrogatory calling for an opinion, when he stated that 'Dr. Miller cannot be compelled to provide opinion evidence simply because he was a subsequently treating physician to Mr. Madore even though he may possess an expertise in the area of treatment.' 6)The opinions sought by the interrogatories in this case were opinions that Dr.Miller may or may not have formed since he treated him or may now be able to form if he reviewed sufficient factual information and prepared, opinions similar to those an expert witness may provide, he is not required to answer these interrogatories calling for such opinions."
2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The appellants appealed their summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)It cannot be said that the findings of fact by the trial judge are unsupported by the evidence or are unreasonable. The court has agreed that the Metis of Northwest Saskatchewan hold an existing and historical Aboriginal right to hunt moose and deer for food which had not been extinguished prior to 1982. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. 2)The issue on this appeal is whether the appellants are Indians within the meaning of s. 91(1) of The Constitution Act, 1867. The objective was primarally safety, both from the words used in the legislation and the evidence introduced. The doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity is not triggered by it. 3)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal peoples' right. The trial judge did not go on (pages 27 to 32) to consider infringement and justification pursuant to Sparrow. Nor should the decision be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law. The appellants have aboriginal hunting rights protected by the Constitution but must meet the Sparrow justification test. 4)The question of whether the appellant's aboriginal rights are not absolute and, as already indicated, laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. The regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights does not extinguish that right but only curtails method of exercising it which is, in any event, universally disapproved by the holders of the right."

The main ground of the application is that the service of the statement of claim on the defendant did not comply with Rule 19(1) of The Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The application is dismissed and the service upon the defendant by registered mail is validated. 1) Rule 19(1) of the Rules must be read in conjunction with Rule 18. 2) Queen's Bench Rule 18 is new rule and came into effect in December 2002. No authorities were available that considered its provisions. 3) Rule 18 requires the defendant to satisfy the court that he has not received notice of the document. 4) The defendant admits receiving a copy of the statement of claim by registered mail and the fact that it did not constitute valid service is of no assistance to him.,"FIAT. This was an application to set aside a noting for default and the resulting default judgment. The main ground of the application was that the service of the statement of claim on the defendant did not comply with Queen's Bench Rule 19(1) of The Queen’s Bench Rules. The defendant deposed as follows: 2. That on or about March 16, 2004 received a registered letter containing the Statement of Claim in the within action. 3. It was my belief and understanding that the receipt by way of registered mail did not constitute proper service on myself as required by the rules. 4. As such did not take any steps to defend the action believing proper personal service would be made on me in due course. 5) In my opinion however, this Rule must be read in conjunction with Rule 18, the relevant provisions of which are as follows; 18(1)(a) Subject to the express provisions of any statute or regulation and notwithstanding any rule respecting service, the court has discretion to validate or set aside service of any document. 6) The application should be supported by an affidavit setting out the circumstances under which the default arose and disclosing defence on the merits. The affidavits must show the nature of the defence and set forth facts which will enable the court to decide whether or not there was a matter which would afford defence to the action. Any delay in making the application must be explained."
2_2008nssm4.txt,"The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined. The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","This is an appeal from an order of the Director dated December 13, 2007. That order allowed the Tenant the sum of $787.50 against the Landlord as compensation arising from what the Director found to be a breach of the statutory condition to provide a premises suitable for habitation. The Landlord did not attend the hearing before the Director. It appears that she missed it inadvertently. The Tenant appeals to this Court against the findings. HELD: The Court found that the Director was essentially correct and her discounting of the value of the rug and clothing went a little too far in her opinion. The damages were $862.50. The Court also discounted the property damage claims on the basis that the furniture's value should be discounted, and because of the lack of evidence of the other items. She allowed $712.50 for the furniture, $75.00 for the area rug and $100 for the clothing. The amount of damages awarded was reduced to the amount originally awarded. 1)The Landlord testified that there simply was no mould. Her position was that the tenant used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was impossible to believe that she could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint. Having heard and assessed her as credible, it was hard to believe she would have engaged in such a tactic. 2)The two versions of the facts were as far apart as they could be. My task of choosing between these two would have been a little more challenging, had I not been able and inclined to rely on the bylaw inspector's findings. He detected mould and the conditions that allowed mould to develop. The condition was very clearly depicted in photos. 3)It was impossible not to believe the landlord, had she actually resorted to this tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away the mould."
9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","The surviving spouse received a death benefit for herself and for her two children. She took issue with the calculation of the death benefit as provided by the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Her counsel appealed the decision to the Court of Queen's Bench. HELD: 1)The death benefit was 50% of the deceased's actual gross yearly employment income. The 'weekly income replacement benefit' referred to in Division 5 of the Act is a different statutory creature than the 'incomereplacement benefit' in Division 4. The ordinary meaning of this is that the payment is made to the surviving spouse on a weekly basis.  2)The 'income replacement' in s.146(1) was not the same as in s146(5) and was calculated on a monthly basis. 3)The deceased's net income was $51,343. SGI was not required to calculate any other form of income that might otherwise be payable to victim, such as deemed income for students who are unable to earn an income. 4)There was no requirement to use the formula in s136 to calculate the deceased spouse's death benefit. The death benefit is 50% if the victim's gross annual employment income and the maximum yearly insurable earnings for 1996 and 1996 was the amount calculated in accordance with the same formula. 5)The loss benefit is one-half the 'weekly Income Replacement Benefit' as it is referred to by the Act and the ordinary meaning is 'payment is made on a daily basis'. SGI is entitled to $301 per week payable every 14 days or lump sum of $336,211.45."

d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","HELD: The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children.

The Ministry requested a 6 month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. HELD: 1) The mother was not seeking a return of the children to her directly but supported the position of the father who asked that the children be returned to him in his care.  2) The father proposed that he will continue living with the mother and the children while the mother first attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he proposes to address his own addiction problems.

6_2014skpc40.txt,"Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","The accused is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece.

The accused was assessed as a high risk to re-offend sexually and required to complete high intensity sex offender programming. HELD: The accused is remanded to November 12. 1) The accused has 59 prior criminal convictions comprised of 12 assault related, 12 sexual assaults, and one common assault offence involving someone under the age of 16 years. There is both a subjective and objective component to his belief that R.N.S. will commit either a serious personal injury offence or sexual assault. 2) There is no triggering event that can be required to engage s.810.2(1) of the Criminal Code. The evidence of the accused's fear that he will commit a serious sexual assault is reasonable in the circumstances of this case. The Court reviewed the binder of materials filed as Exhibit P-1 and relied on the Crown's own personal experience in reviewing and dealing with matters of this sort. The only issue to be determined is whether the accused’s belief is reasonable. 3) There was no evidence that the accused had a prior history of violent or sexual offences. There was an objective component of his beliefs that must be established by the Crown. 4) The Court was unable and refused to make generality of that sort.  5) The Crown indicated that it was only looking for one recognance and it did not matter under which section they obtain it. The court was unable to review and compare and contrast the documentation that was prepared relative to the accused in that case, the Correctional Plan Reports (CPRs) filed with the Ontario Court of Justice. 6) There were no triggering events that could be expected to occur in the context of the defendant’ s.810.1 Recognizance application.

9_1996canlii6809.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff brought an action against five defendants claiming fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a skin rash were the result of silicone implants. One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning. Ten years later she received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. She now suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a persistent immune mediated skin rash on her chest. HELD: 1)The statement of claim does not disclose wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant, the Dow Chemical Company, although there is a causal connection between that conduct and the alleged damages suffered by the plaintiff. 2)The plaintiff is assuming that the corporate entity, DowCorning Corporation, was created for a specific task by the defendant and that in the carrying-out of that task they were in reality one and the same entity. 3)The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. As a result, that defendant cannot be served with the statement of claims within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. 4)There is no causal link between the defendant's duty to disclose the risk inherent to breast implants and any wrongful acts of DowCorporation should be treated as being those of The DowChemical Company. 5)The statements of claim do not disclose an actionable wrong. However, they do state that the defendant is at law responsible for the liabilities of the company. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party, but more particularly by any culpable conduct on part of that defendant.

Trying them together would be in the interests of judicial economy and avoid the possibility of conflicting findings. HELD: The Court ordered that the two actions be tried one immediately after the other in the manner determined by the trial judge and that the defendant be given leave to amend his Statement of Defence.","FIAT. The defendant applied pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 41(2) for an order that this action and Tsatsi v. College of Physicians and Surgeons, Don McMorris and The Sunrise Health Region, be tried together. The statements made by the defendant were made by him on June 1, 2009. He alleged that there were common issues of fact between the two actions and alleged that health officials knew the plaintiff should not be doing the work he was doing. The College Action is also a defamation action. HELD: The defendants were to be tried one after the other, with the College Action proceeding first, and the College action proceeding first. 1)The Court granted leave to amend the Statement of Defence by pleading: 'There are common issues in fact between these actions.' 2)The defendant was to amend his statement of defence in Q.B.G. 1607 of 2009 by adding the following paragraph: 3)The court found that the actions had questions of law or fact in common, based on statements that the plaintiff alleges were made in the defendant's defence. He submits that trying these actions together would be in the interests of judicial economy and avoid the possibility of conflicting findings."
a_1993canlii6596.txt,"Appeal from 107 SaskR 135, 44 RFL(3d)185. Appeal from a judgment directing matrimonial property. The main issue was whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated. The couple's marriage had lasted less than four years. HELD: The QB judgment was upheld regarding the severance package. The severance package was not a reward for past service; it was for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination. The severance package was based on future earnings, which would have occurred within the duration of the marriage. The QB judge did however fail to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give the husband his one-half share of them. Judgment varied accordingly.","This was an appeal from a judgment under The Matrimonial Property Act which dealt with whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The judge either overlooked or failed to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give the date of the application credit for his one-half share of them.  2)The court found no basis upon which to change the disposition. 3)The award of 20 months of future earnings was based on 20.4 months future earnings. If the severance pay was additional remuneration given as a reward for past service, it should be shareable to the extent that it is attributable to past service during the existence of the marital relationship. 4)The husband signed a release acknowledging that 'it is not working out'."

e_2015skqb345.txt,HELD: The court granted summary judgment for the defendants. It held that it could determine the defendants’ application prior to the plaintiffs’ application for certification. The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages. The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. There was no genuine issue requiring a trial. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them. It was not necessary to decide the application for certification.,"The original plaintiff issued his claim under The Class Actions Act for breach of consumer protection and sale of goods legislation, breach of warranty, negligence and a waiver of tort. This claim was subsequently amended and will refer to the amended paragraph numbers. The claim seeks damages against the defendants, Loblaw Companies Limited and Loblaws Inc. [Loblaws]. The claim concerns the misleading and deceptive advertising of 'Low Sodium' beverages by Loblaws. The defendants acknowledge that they have put identical products on the market but labelled them differently. The packaging of the product indicated that it was low sodium but also included nutritional facts label that describes the actual amount of sodium in each product. There is expert evidence submitted by the plaintiffs explaining how this is misleading to consumers. The expert evidence of the Plaintiffs in uncontroverted. The Court of Appeal in Tottrup v. Alberta noted the important role class actions play in today's world, but also stated that 't]he class action offers means of efficiently resolving such disputes in a manner that is fair to all parties.""

They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.","The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of the $2,200 deposit they gave to the defendant on May 5, 2004.

b_1998canlii971.txt,"The respondent grocery store was charged with selling tobacco to a person under the age of 19, contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act. The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial. The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. The trial judge further commented that, had the Act been constitutional, he would have convicted because he did not accept the accused's defence of due diligence. The Crown appealed, and the accused cross-appealed. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial, that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction. It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act. The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires. The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence. The question is not, as the trial judge thought, whether the employee who sold the tobacco was duly diligent, but whether the accused, her employer, exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent the commission of the offence, and by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system.","The appellant was acquitted of selling tobacco or a tobacco product to a person under the age of 19 contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act, S.N.S. 1993, c.14. The trial judge also concluded that the onus was on the appellant to show that its employee was duly diligent rather than whether the accused had been duly diligent. The appellant appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The trial judge found the tobacco access act was ultra vires the Legislature. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act and 'cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation', and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. Where an employer is charged in respect of an act committed by an employee acting in the course of employment, the question will be whether the act took place without the accused's direction or approval. The accused exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent commission of the offence and by taking reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system. 2)There was no conflict here in this sense between the federal and provincial legislation. It follows that the two Acts can operate side-by-side and the trial judge erred in finding the provincial Act unconstitutional."

The police had stopped the respondent when they observed the passenger putting on a seat belt. When the respondent went to the police cruiser, the police observed signs of impairment. The summary conviction appeal court held the stop was random and constituted an arbitrary detention infringing the respondent's s.9 Charter rights. The Crown appealed. Allowing the appeal and restoring the conviction. Random stops are arbitrary detentions infringing the Charters. 9 but are saved by s.1. They are authorized in Nova Scotia under Motor Vehicle Act provisions. In the course of checking licences, registration, insurance policy and mechanical condition police are justified in making observations to detect drinking drivers; the right to counsel under s. 10(b) is suspended during this period.","The appellant appealed his conviction of driving with an illegal blood alcohol level after being pulled over by a police officer for failing a roadside breath test. He argued that s. 9 of the Charter was infringed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in finding the appellant had reasonable and probable grounds for a breathalyzer demand and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) was infringe. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction was restored and the appellant's right to retain and instruct counsel was reinstated.  1)The Court held that, in the context of Ontario's R.I.D.E. program, there was a common law authority in police officers to detain anyone against their will for questioning, or to pursue an investigation. 2)The wording of s. 189a(1) of the Highway Traffic Act is broad enough to authorize random stops of motorists by police officers. While s. 119 of the RCMP Act is inconsistent with ss. 7 and s. 8, it is a valid and constitutional legislative enactment. Comparable provisions in other provinces have been held not merely to impose a duty upon drivers but to provide peace officers with corresponding authority. The Crown has appealed on the basis that the summary conviction appeal court erred respecting arbitrary detention and the exclusion of evidence of the breath-alyzer result under S. 24(2)."

The accused took no position. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. Making an order for video-conferencing for non- participating persons was not permitted because the Court had no control over the policing of the courtroom in Ontario. It would set a dangerous precedent that could result in multiple applications being made in future trials by numerous interested parties in different jurisdictions over which the Court had no control.","The applicant Government of Saskatchewan, Victim Services Branch, brought a motion before myself as trial judge for an order permitting a live audio/video broadcast of the trial set to proceed from a Court of Queen's Bench courtroom in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, to a courtroom in a court house in the Greater Toronto area, Ontario, for the exclusive benefit of the family of the deceased.

The accused had previously applied to a Provincial Court judge, who had declined the accused's application. The issue was whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused's application for judicial interim release.

The hearing on his interim judicial release was held before the Provincial Court judge. The Provincial Court declined the accused's application for judicial interim release on the grounds that his presence in the community awaiting trial would erode the public's confidence in the administration of justice. The Crown applied for a determination of two preliminary issues: 1)Whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused’s application for a judicial interim detention; and 2)Whether this honourable court has jurisdiction to conduct review of the Youth Criminal Justice Act decision. HELD: The accused was granted judicial interim custody pending his preliminary inquiry. The matter of jurisdiction under the old Young Offender's Act rests solely with the superior court of criminal jurisdiction in the Province of Saskatchewan is the Court of Queen‘s Bench; and whether the youth court judge in a Provincial Court has jurisdiction.

Section 33(8) of the Act provides that a judge shall be judge of a superior court in the province in which the accused is charged, but no other court, judge or justice, may release the young person from custody under that section. Section 13(2) provides that if it is an offence under s. 469 of the Code, a youth justice court judge shall serve as judge of the superior Court of justice in that province, which is the province where the accused will stand trial. The jurisdiction for determination of interim judicial releases on an offence of this nature is limited exclusively to the Provincial court unless another act of the parliament of Canada was to limit that jurisdiction. Whether the Youth court judge has jurisdiction in this case is a separate issue. Section 3(1) provides, “if it is a charge set out by s469 of that Act, the judge shall also be a judge of that province in the case in which it is made, and the youth is charged before or after the accused has been ordered to stand trial,” and Section 469 (compelling appearance of an accused and interim release) apply to the detention and release of young persons under this Act.

9_2011skpc15.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused is charged with mischief under $5,000 and aggravated assault. The major issue for determination is whether the accused can be convicted of both charges. HELD: The accused is guilty of mischief. 1)The mens rea required for s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code, is objective foresight of bodily harm. It is not necessary that there be an intent to wound or maim or disfigure. This is simply not believable. 2)When an individual intentionally strikes another in the facial area with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. However, the evidence falls short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused was very qualified in her denial of the assault. 3)The Crown has not proved the requisite intent to sustain convictions under s. 267 or s.268 of the Code. The evidence is that only Ms. Fayant was present in the house. There is no suggestion that she broke the window. The officer testified that she gave him a backhand."

In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed. The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence.

Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual. 5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions.

HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired. The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","HELD: The application was granted.

Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","FIAT: The applicant applies pursuant to s. 67 of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of all bills for legal services that Brabant and Company Law Office [Brabant] rendered to Cowessess. The application proceeded on March 12, 2015. For the reasons that follow, I dismiss the application. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The information put forward here is much more specific. This is as a result of the request itself and it is not fair. 2) There are a number of affidavits from former Chiefs and Council members confirming the quality and effectiveness of the legal services they provided during the time they were involved in with the applicant. The test is less stringent and is based on fairness. The applicant is still sole practitioner and the court has the discretion to abridge the time if satisfied that, 'it is in the interest of justice to do so'. 3) It is not in the interests of justice for the applicant to extend the time beyond the 30 day time period provided by the Act. There is prejudice to the applicant both as an individual and as a lawyer. The amount of fees charged, the threshold set by Klebuc J. and still applicable in essence, is lacking here."
8_1990canlii4256.txt,"Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.","The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. The complainant testified that she had been sexually assaulted on numerous occasions. The Crown also called a social worker trained in counselling families and children. The social worker testified that her evidence had been consistent throughout and had been given in a reasonable manner 'worthy of belief'. Dismissing the appeal, that even though the complainant must have been mistaken as to the number of Friday nights she was sexually molested, such a misconception on her part, under all the circumstances of this case, does not destroy her credibility. The admission of hearsay evidence was an error so grave as to call for a quashing of conviction."
c_1996canlii5615.txt,"The appellant appealed his sentence of five months in prison to be followed by 18 months probation following his plea of guilty to the theft of his grandmother's car. Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing. The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail. The appellant was allowed to file affidavits as to the his progress concerning his problems with drugs and alcohol. Per Pugsley, J.A., Flinn, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a suspended sentence subject to terms, that the sentence imposed was not fit, and that it was not in society's interest that the appellant should be removed form his present positive environment. Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value. It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time it was made. Taking into account the factors before the sentencing judge, the sentence imposed could not be found to be clearly unreasonable.","The accused, who was 19 at the time of the offence, stole his grandmother's car from her home at Newport Station and together with two friends, drove to the Canada-U.S. border station where they were arrested by border guards when they attempted to cross into the US at approximately 8:00 a.m. that morning. The accused was charged with theft of property exceeding $5,000 contrary to Criminal Code s334. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The sentence imposed was not fit. 2)It was not in society's interest that the accused should be removed out of his present positive environment and placed in custody. 3)The accused had undergone significant rehabilitative change since he came to live with me and was not likely to become involved in the type of attitude and behaviour that resulted in his conviction."

The Agreement provided that neither would claim spousal support.HELD: 1)Credibility was determinative. The wife was articulate, intelligent and forthright while the husband was found to be evasive, argumentative and untruthful in answering a number of questions including the circumstances surrounding the signing of the agreement, the untrue statements he set out in his divorce petition in Ontario regarding his residency and in applying for default judgment when he knew the petitioner had served an Answer. 2)The agreement was rendered 'void' by the fact the parties cohabited for more than 90 days. 3)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The parties signed a separation agreement dated September 6, 1996. The agreement provided, among other things, that the parties would live separately and neither would claim spousal support from the other. The issue was whether the parties could cohabitate for more than 90 days and whether they should vitiate their agreement to live separate and apart? HELD: The Court found the respondent to be an intelligent, articulate and forthright person and more particularly as an individual whose life has been largely controlled by his former spouse and by the events that occurred during his search for new positions in the health care administration field. The Court also found that the respondent evasive, argumentative and untruthful in his answers to a number of questions."
9_1999canlii12597.txt,"The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action. The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act which:(a)restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the petitioner or his solicitors in relation to the respondent's claim in Queen's Bench Action No. Q.B.G. No. 2270/97, J.C.

In addition to the child support ordered in the Corollary Relief Judgment, the husband had signed a document in which he agreed to repay the costs of the daughter's American student loans (which had to be obtained in the wife's name as the wife was an American). The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation. Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'. There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties.",HELD: The application was dismissed.

6_2015skqb138.txt,"Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","FIAT: In this application, one of the Szwagierczak's five daughters seeks an order directing a trial to prove the 2013 will in solemn form. The grounds asserted by the applicant are that the defendant did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied that the applicant has not made out a genuine issue for trial. Accordingly, the application must be dismissed.  2) There is no evidence of irregularity or evidence on the peripheral points which will lead a chamber judge to conclude that there is a sufficient issue for proof in solemn fashion.  3) The court reviewed the specific evidence contained in the several affidavits filed in respect of this application. It is important to note that the test in Quaintance is, as is the general statement of the issue to be determined in Dieno, based in the context of jurisprudence respecting the wishes of the testator and the validity of the will. If there are suspicious circumstances that cast a measure of doubt on one or more of these legal requirements, such circumstances will affect the ability of the propounder to rely on the presumption."

The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.",This was an application under Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order in the nature of mandamus compelling the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The respondent had been a long term recipient of income assistance from the Department of Community Services.

His application was denied based on failure to provide requested information and the respondent continued to refuse to reinstate eligibility from June 27th to September 7th as period covered by the order.

The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial. The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access.

The paragraphs of the amended statement of claim at issue deal with the fact that the plaintiff alleges he was assaulted by the defendant and sustained bodily harm. The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings. HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings.

The Court found that the defendant was entitled to proceed independently in subsequent civil proceedings against the same defendant.

This rule prevails even in contests between a natural parent and a stranger. The parental tie between mother and child is, of course, not to be ignored in such a contest. It is taken into account by the judge when considering the factors outlined in paragraph (i) of s.8. The trial judge's error as to the categorization of the appellant as needing level care when in fact the level is funding level and not a care level is not material as there exists other strong evidence, including that of the court appointed psychologist as to concerns about the mother's ability to care for her child and the risk to the child if he is left unsupervised for extended periods of time.

The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner.

The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident. Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854. The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs. Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero.

In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs.

The matter proceeded by conference call and written submissions. 2) As a corporation may only litigate with legal representation, Henry is empowered and obliged to have counsel for 609. He was appointed for that purpose and is obliged to so instruct 609's counsel. Whether that counsel is Mr. Brehon, another member of his firm or someone from outside that firm is entirely matter for Henry. Such counsel is entitled to access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action, including preparation of a statement as to documents and following the modified discovery process set out in my earlier fiat. 3) The questions posed by the participants in their written submissions demonstrate confusion and misunderstanding as to the nature of the actions and consequently of a party's rights and responsibilities. 4) Some of the misunderstandings have their genesis in the pleadings which recite the plaintiff to be Henry, capacity which the defendants admit. The plaintiff is and was 609 and Contrary to Brehon's position the action remains derivative one in which the action proceeds for the benefit of the plaintiff against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. However, no evidence of quantum of legal fees was provided and the merits of the documents were difficult to assess at this early stage. These concerns still pertain and without prejudice to renewal of the application for cost reimbursement when the concerns expressed by the Chief Justice can be allayed, the costs remain with Henry."
d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","An application for an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant. The application alleged that the applicant, an accountant, filed fraudulent T4 and created false T4 sales for the period 2001 to 2003, and misreported HST sales. An earlier Information, sworn on April 21, 2005, had been a basis for the search. The affidavit contained incomplete and misleading information and the learned Justice of the Peace erred in concluding that the necessary grounds existed for the warrant. In light of his clear statement on cross-examination, the Court is satisfied that the accused's own evidence supports the inference that he would not have pursued a warrant without paragraphs 20-23 in the Information. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The Court found that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias and that the learned justice of the peace ought to have recused himself from considering the application to issue the search warrant, having previously acted in a solicitor/client relationship with the spouse of the applicant. 2)The application was dismissed. 3)The court found that the application was not pre-ordained and that there were reasonable and probable grounds for a warrant to search the applicant's (and his wife's) home."

While the claim discloses a possible cause of action based on the Attorney General's statutory undertakings, this alone doesn't decide the matter. The amendments add nothing by way of necessary detail to the claim, which doesn't plead sufficient material facts to comply with the Rules on pleadings (see Rule 4.02).","The defendant AGC moves for summary judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.03 (1)(a) and (c) on the grounds that the plaintiff's amended statement of claim does not plead sufficient material facts to comply with the rules. The AGC argues that notwithstanding finding a cause of action, the plaintiff’s amended Statement of Claim does not comply with rules. While this is a significant factor, it does not necessarily defend against this summary judgment application based on his pleadings. HELD: The Court concluded that the defendant had a cause for action arising from the statutory undertakings given by the AGC in 1996. The statement of claims did not appear to be deficient in any of the three enumerated grounds.

On January 2005, the Board's appeals committee upheld a 2004 decision of the Board's case management division that the applicant was fit for employment. Although the applicant has another avenue of appeal available to him within the workers' compensation system, he takes the position that the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction, so that there is no proper decision from which to appeal, leaving him with an application for judicial review as his only remedy. HELD: Whether or not the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction and consequently are a nullity, the applicant has an adequate alternative remedy available to him. No special circumstances that might justify judicial intervention at this time have been presented.

4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine at Rocanville, Saskatchewan. HELD: The only remaining issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. The law is well settled that an employee is under an implied obligation not to compete with an employer during the term of his or her employment. An employee who submitted a bid for a food services contract in competition to her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of her employment contract. The plaintiff was entitled to no more than nominal damages. The court awarded $500.00. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred in characterizing the employee's actions as mere preparation. The employee competed with her employer for business which had been the employer's; her placing of the bid went beyond preparation. Although the defendant had given notice that he would no longer work for the plaintiff after September 30th, he still employed at the time he made his proposal. He did not have the experience suggested by Fortney but he did not consider that to be confidential information or a trade secret. If there had been electricians available through the union hall they could have undertaken the work being performed by Sullivan. The claim against PCS was dismissed. The only issue left was whether the employee breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff and whether he breached his contract of employment by submitting his proposal to the defendant. The courts have held that merely planning to establish competing business does not ipso facto violate the duty. The position of the defendant when he submitted his proposal is almost identical to that of the plaintiff in this case. The defendant knew nothing as to profit margins, etc. of plaintiff. He knew nothing about profit margins or profit margins. He had the experience suggesting that Fortney would not be able to provide the plaintiff with the same benefits as Fortney."
8_2011skca35.txt,"The applicants applied for leave to appeal from a Chambers decision denying their application to dismiss the respondent's claim against them for want of prosecution. The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan. The building was substantially completed in 1970. In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building. In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss. In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief. In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer. The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997. Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held. In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant. Secondly, the issue of delays in litigation is important and the case will present an opportunity for the Court to clarify the legal framework pertaining to such matters.","The applicants are defendants in an action commenced by the Respondent, University of Saskatchewan. They applied to have the claim against them dismissed for want of prosecution but were unsuccessful. They now seek leave to appeal that decision. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted. 1) The standard of review applied in respect of decisions such as the one in issue here will present some difficulty for the Applicants on appeal. Nonetheless, the Court is persuaded there is enough merit in their position to warrant granting leave. As matter of first impression only, arguments (a) and (b) summarized above in para. 13, appear to be of particular interest. Given the decision of the Queen's Bench Chambers judge, it is not in the Court's interest to delay the appeal. 2) The Court is cognizant of the fact that there is a longer time frame for an appeal than there is for a decision to be struck for delay."

The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available. The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid. After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call. The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape. The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio.

HELD: 1) The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February. He returned to high school in the fall of 2004. He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother. Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media. He is still under his mother's charge. She provides him with room and board. He is only 19 years old.

The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm.

HELD: 1) There was a claim for $16,500 which was said to be owing to the respondent for the Versatile 160 tractor. He sold his trailer and the proceeds of $12,000 were used to purchase the acreage. He now claims an exemption in that amount. 2) There were several other debts and expenses which the respondent submitted should be taken into account. 3) An RRSP registered in the name of the respondent was found to be exempt. The interest earned would not be exempt, but have no evidence as to what that has been. 4) The petitioner received no benefit from these expenses. Her furniture was included in the distribution. 5) The respondent's RRSP was not registered in her name. However, as best I can make out, it was acquired prior to the marriage. Accordingly, the petitioner should be paid $2,400 for the automobile and boat resulting in a total of $33,257.31. 6) In addition to the farm machinery, the respondent sold his tractor and the sale proceeds were used for the farm expenses. 7) There appears to be an RRSP registration in the respondent's name as well as a bank account. However the respondent shall have three months in which to pay the amount of the judgment and, in the event payment is not made, he may apply to this court for directions as to sale of the family home. 8) There is an exemption for the tractor in respect to the purchase of two 80-11 Seed Rites which were acquired from an uncle's estate and the 30' Morris rod weeder of value of $225. Both are statute-barred and the value of the tractor is unclear. 9) A debt of $1,200 which was referred to three appraisals; one which was done at the behest of the petitioner and two for the respondent.

There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support. If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support.","The appellant applies pursuant to Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules for an order staying execution of spousal support arrears created as a result of an interim order. The appellant’s application to impose a stay with respect to enforcement of the retroactive Spousal Support Arrears was allowed. HELD: The application to lift the stay of proceedings is allowed. The court reviewed the evidence before the Chambers judge and concluded that the appellant was making significant payments with regard to the family home to cover the mortgage, taxes, insurance and utilities. The Chambers judge concluded that he was not supported by the evidence presented and the appellant may be prejudiced by the imposition of the stay.

After a decree nisi of foreclosure had issued but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners (the former husband) applied for judicial sale of the matrimonial home. The joint owners separated in 1999 and are involved in an acrimonious family law court action. The wife has exclusive possession of the property. The Credit Union as first mortgagee opposed the application. The co-owner did not participate. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)This is not the proper forum to attempt to affect a family property settlement. The husband was not entitled in these proceedings to a possession order. The wife prevented every attempt to show the property to prospective owners. There was no reason to assume she will be any more cooperative with a court appointed realtor. The Credit Union did not request immediate possession. 2)The court's entitlement to order a judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The court reviewed the history of the statutory authority for a judicial sale in a mortgage foreclosure proceedings. The 1852 Chancery Procedure Amendment Act was repealed in 1881 and replaced by Ordinance 51, Rule 1, which became law in the NWT by virtue of the Judicature Ordinance No.6 of 1893. It is now found in s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act in its modified form. Deciding whether it is 'necessary or expedient' within the meaning of s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act is, however, a judicial exercise.","After a decree nisi of foreclosure had been issued, one of the defendant registered owners applied for judicial sale of the mortgaged property, being the matrimonial home. The mortgagee opposed the application and the co-owner, Sandra Klarenbach, did not participate in the hearing. HELD: The court's entitlement to order judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The court gave to these courts the right, in foreclosure proceedings, to make an order for sale whenever the court deemed it necessary or expedient to do so. This is not the proper forum to attempt to effect a family property settlement. The applicant is not entitled, in these proceedings, in a possession order. As long as Sandra remains in possession of the property, judicial sale through a realtor has little prospect of success.  1) Border Credit Union did not request immediate possession pursuant to Rule 439 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It did not seek immediate possession. 2) The applicant, who was not entitled in the proceedings to a possession possession order, was not co-operative with a court-appointed realtor.  3) The 90-day redemption period has now expired and subject to this application the applicant is entitled to apply for a final order of foreclosure. Any further delay that does not result in sale and payment of the mortgage in full, will result in lost security value for the Credit Union."
b_1994canlii5130.txt,"The City applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the Defendant Unions from engaging in unlawful picketing. The City alleged that the members of the Defendant Unions obstructed and/or blocked entrances to and/or exits from various premises of the plaintiff including, inter alia, its Electrical Distribution Department, its Water and Pollution Control Department and its Water Treatment Plant thereby interfering with the plaintiff's statutory and contractual obligations to provide essential services to its citizens and others, and, as well, created a danger to the health and safety of its said citizens and others. The Defendant Unions did not file any materials. HELD: Application allowed. On the whole of the evidence the court was satisfied that the applicant had raised a substantial question to be tried, had established a prima facie case, was in danger of suffering injury which could not adequately be compensated for by the award of damages in money, and that the balance of convenience in the matter favoured the applicant.","At the conclusion of the hearing of this application, the court granted the applicant's application for an interim injunction until trial or until a further order on certain terms and conditions. HELD: The application was granted. An interim injunction was granted until trial, or until further order. The Court indicated that there would be a balance of convenience in the matter. 1)The applicant had shown more than the mere prospect or apprehension of injury. It had shown that the defendants in doing that which the applicant alleges is in violation of its rights and that the applicant is suffering in consequence. 2)There was a prima facie case of the violation by the defendants of a right or rights that was asserted."

The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent, a resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and was sentenced to nine months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck used to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The truck was ordered forfeited. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the appeal was allowed. 1)It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. 2)The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the Act. 3)The truck was owned by the respondent and paid for through loan from his parents. The trial judge found that 'basically all of the money' to pay for the truck came from the parents' bank account but they had registered no lien to protect their interests. He found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' He found it integral to the operation, aside from transporting him to various places across the country. 4)A more significant issue was the refusal of the sentencing judge to order the forfeiture of this truck, which had value of approximately $20,000. The sentence judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeitures and erred in failing to do so. He failed to take into account the impact of an order of forfeiture on any member of the immediate family of the person charged with or convicted of the offence, if the dwelling house was the member's principal residence at the time the charge was laid and continues to be the member’s principal residence, and if the member is innocent of any complicity in the offence or of any collusion in relation to the act. 5)The Court was of the view that the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range but, in these circumstances, find there is no basis for interfering with the sentence."
2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The respondent Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) appealed its decision denying the worker's claim for recognition because his stress injury was not personal injury by accident but rather a result of workplace stressors. WCAT found that gradual onset stress requires that there have been work related events or stressors that are unusual and excessive viewed objectively, that is, in comparison to those experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation. At the heart of the appeal is whether WCAT was wrong to take this approach and if not, whether it applied it unreasonably. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) WCAT correctly decided that there had been, in fact, excessive stressors in the workplace. There were certain subjective elements which should be considered in determining if a worker's subjective reaction to external stressors is not relevant to determining if he suffered a compensable accident under s. 4(1) of the GECA; 2) The Policy sets out the better view of the law and should be taken as declaratory of the principles to be applied in this regard to all stress claims under GECA. 3) The Court reviewed the history of the tribunal and found that the policy was the correct one, both under Policy 1.3.6 and under the general law applying to GECA claims in Nova Scotia. The Court found that there were no 'unusual or excessive' stressors on the workplace which could be considered objectively as set out in the Policy. The policy set out the objective facts that each type of stressor is not a personal injury caused by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. The court found that this reflects the law which was in place before the Policy came into effect in July 2005. 4) The court reviewed the reasoning process by which WCAT reviewed these questions on appeal. It found that, in the context of the policy, the workplace events and stressors experienced by the worker were not 'extraordinarily and excessive' in the sense that they are compared to the work-related events, stressors, and other events experienced by a similar or similar worker in a similar occupation, WCAT applied it to the decisions relating to the claimant's claim in this case. It also found that WCAT did not err in determining whether there were workplace events (e.g., 'interpersonal conflict and ineffective management contributed to a toxic work environment') sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset onset stress.

The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams in one hundred milliliters of blood.

During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","This was an appeal from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago.

The officer dialed the number for Legal Aid duty counsel for the accused and the accused spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel prior to providing breath samples of 190 milligrams and 180 milligrams.

The accused had not succeeded in establishing on a balance of probabilities that the accused's right to consult counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been violated.

The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases.

The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed.

The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial.

She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice.

Arrears for that period will be adjusted to reflect the actual income earned by the respondent. 1) When dealing with a request to vary, the court must accept the original order is correct and that it is time to expunge the support order. 2) The respondent has failed in his onus here for the years 2005 through to 2012. There is little doubt it will be onerous for him, but then, on the other hand, he has avoided paying anything for considerable period of time. If they want to rely on their declared income, they must establish why this time their representations should be accepted by the court. 3) The court must consider whether material change has occurred requiring review of the order. In approaching variation, the respondent needs to show material change in circumstances. The ability to vary an interim order has now been confirmed by the Court of Appeal. In the circumstances, the payor does have the ability to pay the arrear from 2013 to date, due to the length of time that has elapsed. If he proceeds by way of motion to change, he must face the presumption that the original Order was correct and the original imputation of income was correct. 4) The Court must determine whether the existing order is still valid and whether it should be varied retroactively to impute a different income than that which was imputed in 2005. The respondent should not be rewarded in this regard for waiting out the payment obligations placed upon him. 5) It is not necessary for the court to determine whether an aggrieved party feels income was wrongly imputed. The actual situation does constitute material change. He is working full-time at this position and there is no suggestion he is under-employed in his new job. The Court will deal with the issue of material change as is necessary for final order of the Court."
d_1997canlii11230.txt,"The contract for the construction of a spur rail line to the grain terminal provided that either party could refer any contract dispute to arbitration. The Arbitrator's award favoured the A &amp; E Rail Contractor's position. Leave to appeal had been granted. At issue was were whether the arbitrator applied the correct measure of damages and whether there was any evidence to support the findings of fact. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed. The respondent's application for enforcement of the award was granted without costs. 1)The issues were questions of fact not law. The errors complained of were the same questions referred to the arbitrator for determination. Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law. The wording on the second issue was changed slightly to read 'in his calculation as to damages awarded for increased costs of winter construction'. There was some evidence upon which the arbitrator could make a finding of fact. 2)As none of the bars set out in the Act applied the court was required by s50(3) to give judgment enforcing the award.  3)The application for costs on a solicitor and client basis was denied. Failing agreement between the parties, the appellant would pay the respondent's taxed costs on the appeal on a party and party basis.","The respondent applied for leave to appeal an arbitration award respecting a contract dispute between it and Rail Contractors. The contract provided that either party can refer any dispute respecting their contractual obligations to arbitration. The dispute arose between the parties respecting the performance of the contract and both parties agreed to resolution of the dispute by arbitration. They each retained legal counsel, agreed on an arbitrator, and defined the issues to be resolved. The arbitrator heard two days of viva voce evidence, admitted several documents as exhibits, received written legal briefs from counsel, and subsequently rendered a written decision that dealt with all the issues before him. The appeal court determined that the findings of the arbitrator with which the appellant takes issue were not questions of law but rather questions of fact. The respondent's application for enforcement of the award was granted without costs. By adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' to the first ground in the appeal, does not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law."

The petitioner alleged they separated in 1990 when the father left the province to seek work elsewhere. He sent no money for two years until 1992 when he sent $3,200 and bought a washer and dryer. She commenced a divorce action in 1996 which was adjourned sine die by consent. The marriage was dissolved in June 1998. The respondent did not keep records of money sent as he did not consider they had separated until 1993. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1)Nothing turned on the actual date of separation which was difficult to determine. The mother was entitled to make a claim for support whenever she believed his contribution was inadequate, whether or not she perceived herself separated from him. 2)The primary purpose of a support order is not to compensate for past failure but to satisfy present need. Making a retroactive order would not address that purpose. She did not make a claim until 1996 and then did not prosecute her claim for another two years, at a time when neither she nor the children were dependent.","The mother sought retroactive child and spousal support. Her application was rather unusual because no children were presently dependent upon her and by her own admission she is self-sufficient. Nevertheless, she claims her former husband did not pay sufficient support when both she and the children were dependent upon him and now wants a catch-up payment of $47,367. HELD: The application was dismissed. The primary purpose of a support order is not to recompensate for past failure but instead, to satisfy present need.

Dismissing the appeal, that the respondent did not wilfully make any false statement, and answered all questions as required on the documents provided. Her silence in the face of uncertainty over her in-laws involvement in the fire did not constitute fraud. If the appellant expects an insured to comply with statutory conditions, it must reproduce them in the policy and provide a question on the proof of loss form to that effect.",This was an appeal from a decision of the trial judge dismissing the appellant's claim that the respondent J.L. conspired with her sister and brother-in-law to have the seasonal dwelling owned by the four respondents intentionally burned. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to the respondent. 1)The appellant did not commit a fraud in obtaining payment under the policy; she made no wilful false statement. There was not a false statement in the proof of loss. 2)On the facts of this case the respondent's silence in the face of her uncertainty whether or not her brother had anything to do with the fire is not fraud. On the facts the appellant was not in breach of the statutory conditions. The failure of the appellant to advise her sister of the possibility that the Nicholsons arranged the fire did not amount to fraud. 3)There is no evidence that the failure to disclose the conversations with the sister was fraud such as to vitiate the insurance coverage.
7_2010nssc146.txt,"The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","The accused brought an application for relief under s.24(1) of the Charter alleging that the Crown's intention to lead newly discovered evidence compromises her s. and 11(d) Charter rights. HELD: A mistrial was ordered following the hearing of a voir dire and a day and one-half of evidence in the trial proper. The accused gave up her right to challenge its admissibility, based on decisions that she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy. The Crown argued that the disclosure of evidence by the Crown can affect the accused's election with respect to mode of trial or to the plea. To that end, through her counsel, she agreed to have the video taped statement go in without contest. The Court was satisfied that the new evidence could be used to impeach the accused and contradict things she had told to the Crown in her videotaped statement. The court was not satisfied that it could cure the prejudice of late disclosure to the accused by an order at this late stage."

The Chambers judge refused to grant relief, finding the issues to be academic in nature and within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University, but ruled his supervisor should be removed from the Committee because of an apprehension of bias. The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure. He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias.

It simply restated what was at issue and found to have had no effect. 2)There was no tenable basis for interfering.

The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below. 4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations.

c_1998canlii13762.txt,"The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s27 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell them the lands which were subject to their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation. The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal. There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which were subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act.

Specifically that they did not meet the requirements set out in s. 26(2)(b) of The Farm Land security Act. HELD: The application for relief was dismissed. 1)The defendant counterclaimed against the plaintiffs for rent owing from the plaintiffs as 'over holding tenants'. 2)To interpret the letter of commitment to beferred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgagefinancing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise their right to first refusal. 3)The terms of mortgage financing will always require certain things be performed before money is paid. The loan approval issued by the defendant is not an unconditional and unequivocal commitment to finance the purchase of the farm land. 4)The court reviewed the evidence and concluded that the defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation by offering a different requirement for the exercise of the right of refusal in its offer enclosed with the cover letter dated March 24, 1997.

4_1994canlii4365.txt,"This was a petition for divorce with an application for settlement of corollary matters, especially custody and access. The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions. The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue. The mother sought sole custody with generous access. The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say. Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues. As the parties lacked flexibility, a detailed access plan was incorporated.","The parties separated in June 1992. They have two children, Conor and Braden. The parties have been married for eight and half years and have two adult children, ages 7 and 9 years. The father seeks equal parental control and responsibility by an order for joint custody under s16(4) of the Divorce Act. The mother proposes sole custody, allowing him to be the final decision maker in matters relating to the children's welfare, growth and development while being prepared to promote maximum contact between the children and their father to the extent that this is consistent with the best interests of the children. The Corollary Relief order shall reflect the parties' agreement for each parent to hold in trust and administer one-half the investments; specific access; and quantum of child maintenance.

Both parents were motivated by their interest in and concern for their children and not by a desire to interfere with the other parent's relationship with their children."

The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg. He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence. Dismissing the action, that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way.

Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower. The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D & S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. It is alleged that the defendant failed to perform as agreed and in consequence the plaintiff seeks damages. The defendant resists the claim and by way of a counterclaim seeks judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) The construction was completed four months late. There was a discussion about round pillars and it was intended that they would be a part of the contract. The plaintiff adopted the suggestion and the construction was done. 2) The plaintiff was not liable to pay for the work but was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost and he did so. 3) Although the plaintiff ordered many changes, improvements and additions, it was clearly an extra ordered by him and he enjoyed savings by not paying interest. The contract contemplated that there would be extras but it did not speak to their cost. The amount to be charged to the plaintiff was to be the actual cost to the defendant. The delay postponed this and the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendant one-half of that loss or $1,400. 4) Costs of Performance were to be preferred as the measure of damages, but reasonableness may require a different approach including diminution of value."
9_2003skqb229.txt,"An appeal of conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (Criminal Code s.255 and s.253) on the grounds of misdirection in finding there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to impairment; an incorrect inference and failure to give correct legal effect to the facts as found including the lack of evidence of impairment at the material time while he was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence. Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence. The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.  2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838). However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba). A properly instructed jury could have arrived at the same inference on the facts as found.","The accused was convicted of driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs contrary to s. 255 and 253 of the Criminal Code.

She also failed to give a correct legal effect to the facts that she found, including, inter alia, the lack of evidence or indicia of impairment of the appellant at the time that he was found to have care or control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge's findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment by alcohol are supported by the evidence. Direct evidence confirms that the accused's condition did not change for the period he was in the driver's seat and if impairment is proven, which is the next issue will deal with, then it applies equally to when he was first observed in the vehicle as to later observed in it."

Only if the chambers judge abused his discretion by acting on some wrong principle, by disregarding some material matter of fact, or by failing to act judicially is the Court of Appeal at liberty to interfere.  2) It is not our function to fine tune orders such as this one. We are all of the opinion that this expedited family law appeal must be dismissed. We have reviewed the voluminous affidavit evidence in the record and find no misuse of judicial discretion."
d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The petitioner sought an order under the Dependents' Relief Act varying child maintenance from $150 per child to $1,245 per month for the two children.

The term 'Personal effects' did not include items of personal or domestic use or ornaments, clothing, furniture or furniture.  6)Personal effects did notinclude grain, cattle, farm equipment or machinery having some personal connection with the deceased.  7)The children were entitled to share equally with the father."
8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan on December 1, 1993. At trial, counsel for the respondents advanced standard criminal law defences to the charges, and also a constitutional defence that the respondents as Metis had an aboriginal right to fish for food. The trial judge found the accused not guilty on counts 1, 2, 6, 7 and 5 but for the constitutional defence which he had found to be established. It is the acquittals based on the statutory defence that are the subject of this Crownappeal. HELD: 1)It is the Crown's position that it is open to the Crown to attempt to establish that your clients have an Aboriginal right to fishing for commercial purposes as a potential defence. 2)The Crown intended not by word or action to make commercial fishing the constitutional issue at all. Rather, the appeal is limited to the argument that such a right was extinguished (appeal ground 4) and in any event the regulations are justified. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to conclude that therequirement to obtain a licence before engaging in fishing by means of a net setout in s.26(a) of the SFSRegulations does not constitute a 'prima facie infringement of any existing aboriginal right' of fish or to make out all the charges against your clients."

The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B. HELD: Queen's Bench Rule 184B calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer. The fact the offer was revoked does not alter the concept in Rule 184B and the resulting sanction.

1990canlii4096.txt,"This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","The applicant sought an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against him in respect of charges brought against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (I.D.A.). The hearing was set aside by the Appeal Division and the disciplinary panel was reconvened to determine the validity of the charges against the applicant. The applicant applied to have the hearing adjourned until such time as he was medically able to attend. Dismissing the application, that the application for interim injunction is premature and irreversible. The application for certiorari is joined with an application for an order restraining the respondent from taking any further proceedings. HELD: The application is granted. 1)The court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very special circumstances.  2)The application for the interim injunction was granted without costs.  3)The applicant would have satisfied the requirements of the test."
4_2005nspc10.txt,"The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and cocaine for the use of trafficking both under s.5(2) and with trafficking of property obtained by crime. The accused had a knapsack with him in the vehicle console where the police later found it and a large amount of cash in the back pocket of the defendant's backpack. The police officers seized the backpack and at subsequent search at the police station it was found to contain: an unopened bottle of Olands Export Ale, 232 grams of cannabis marihuana, 63 grams of cocaine, bundles of cash containing $3000 in total, a digital scale, a black wallet, a toothbrush and deodorant. HELD: The accused was guilty of all three charges before the Court. 1) The only reasonable inference to be drawn from all of the evidence before the court is not only that the knapsacks was in the personal possession of the accused but that, because the cocaine was found in the same bag as large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the accused was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large quantities of cash from any other source, the only logical inference here is that these rolls of cash were proceeds of drug trafficking. 2) The evidence was circumstantial in which the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the drugs and money were in the accused's possession. The evidence established that the accused had knowledge of all of its contents and consented to their being there. 3) There was no evidence to support the Crown's inference that the items seized by the police in this case were possessed for sale, not personal use. It was obvious that he had control of the bag and its contents until he left the motor vehicle. The fact that they were found in an open motor vehicle in the open spot was also significant in the conclusion that the marijuana and cocaine were possessed by the defendant, not for sale. 4) There is no evidence that the defendant changed his hands when he entered the vehicle to change his hands. It is clear that he consented. The cash was not in his possession at the time of the investigation. 5) The Court was satisfied that the only reasonable conclusion was that these items were in his personal possession knowing they were obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. The Court found that the evidence seized was admissible."

O'Brien. There would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal was dismissed. 3) The evidence of the complainant did not support the Crown's conclusion that the appellant was the dealer and that the methamphetamine in the basement belonged to him.  4) The Crown's case law applied to both affidavits, they failed the test for admission for slightly different reasons in each case."

b_2003nssf19.txt,"The Agency applied for the permanent care of four young children, aged 2 to 5 years. The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met.

They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision.

There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his youth sentence when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Justice Court for review under s. 103 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The Crown appealed her decision and argued that, on a proper reading of the YCJA, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. The Youth Court judge held that the sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The court accepted the Crown's argument and found that the youth court judge erred in her interpretation of s. 107(1)(b). For the reasons which follow, that this proviso cannot have been intended to incorporate the power to suspend which is provided for under a separate section. These sections may allow the issuance of a warrant authorizing apprehension, which is found in s. 102(2), and may direct the provincial director to review the case promptly, as that is the focus of s102. This language is inconsistent with the notion that the right of appeal particularized in ss. 109(4) to (8) arises only in relation to certain kinds of orders and, in particular, that it arises only when there has been an unsuccessful attempt to keep the young person in custody. The court reviewed the case and, within forty-eight hours, cancelled the suspension of the conditional supervision or refer the case to the youth justice court for review. 2) The Court reviewed the Youth Court decision and found, with any modifications that the circumstances require, that the Minister of Justice's ability to “suspend” community supervision is subject to appeal."
2_2007skqb99.txt,"This judgment dealt with divorce and division of family property. At issue was the value of the matrimonial home and the balance of family property. HELD: Decree of divorce issued. Valuations of the family home and property were made, and exemptions and equitable considerations were addressed. Equalization payments were prescribed. As the results of the action were mixed, no costs were ordered.","The parties were previously before the Court in an action for custody, access, support, divorce and division of family property. Due to change in circumstances, it was necessary to sever of the matters of custody and access and support and the marriage was dissolved on the 31st day after the date of this judgment. HELD: The Court ordered that the balance of the family property be distributed equally, subject only to the exceptions, exemptions, and equitable considerations mentioned in the Family Property Act. 1) The Court fixed July 19, 2005 (application date) for the valuation of the Family Home. For distribution purposes, the Court fixed that value at $94,621.77. 2) There is nothing in the evidence that would lead to conclusion that the Court would prefer to order the sale and distribution of proceeds from something less than the entire family property, such as the SE¼/27/52-05-W3rd. 3) The court has indicated generally preference for using that date of application. 4) The evidence is not independent evidence; it is the evidence of the parties. The Court has indicated that it would be unfair and inequitable to order a distribution of the whole family home if some unusual circumstance, like substantial changes in value caused by market forces, created an artificial result if the date was selected."

The mother moved with the daughter to British Columbia in 1997. The parties did not agree upon ongoing access.

It was important that he be reintroduced to his 10 year old daughter in a gradual and consistent fashion. He was granted access intitially for three and four hours in both provinces, then two days at the father's parent's home including overnight access and two days in the summer in British Columbia.

e_1984canlii199.txt,"The Plaintiff contracted to provide market survey to the Defendant. Before its completion, the contract was replaced by second contract for Fund Development Officer. Each party had a different understanding of the duties of the Fund Development Officer which misunderstanding the Judge classified as a mutual mistake. The failure of performance by plaintiff entitled defendant to repudiate the contract. Defendant's counterclaim for rescission of first agreement, and repayment of monies paid under second agreement, failed where it accepted plaintiff's performance and paid consideration therefore.","This was an action brought by Fossil Fuel Development Ltd. against Tudex Petroleums Ltd. (Tudex) for breach of contract claiming damages. In its counterclaim, Fossil seeks rescission of the contract and agreement relating to the market study. The dismissal of Fossil's action effectively releases Tudex from any further obligation under the contract of June 2, 1981. The repudiation of contract by Tudex is legitimized. So an order for rescission is not necessary."
b_2012skqb443.txt,The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their children. The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.,"FIAT: The application at bar is another salvo in a bitter custody and access dispute. HELD: 1) Settlement negotiations are protected by a jointly held privilege that cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. This privilege is fundamental to the policy interest of promoting settlement discussions as means to avoiding trial. It should only be set aside if there is a very compelling, competing policy warranting such a declaration. As settlement communications are almost always irrelevant to the issues that are properly considered by the Court, it is rare that there will be any competing policy or, indeed, any reason to reference them at all. A party cannot unilaterally waive privilege even on the proposal he made because it is not his to waive. 2) The respondent exhibited a letter to his counsel that was from his counsel to the petitioner's counsel. Just as promised, the letter goes on to set out a detailed, comprehensive offer of settlement. The communication need not contain any settlement offer any communication designed or intended to explore settlement, or from which the Court might infer there are settlement communications contemplated or in the works, is protected. The privilege is clearly an important one and in cases of doubt as to whether the correspondence does relate to the negotiations, the Court should err on the side of protecting the privilege."
b_2005nssf21.txt,"The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","The parties share joint custody of the three children. Day-to-day primary care shall be with the mother. The parties agree that a Joint Custody Order shall issue and that primary care will remain with the father. The children's best interests are served by remaining in the matrimonial home with their mother. HELD: 1) The parties have been extensively involved in the operation of the property since marriage and that the couple considered this property to be a joint business operated for the benefit of the family. 2) It is apparent to me that the children will have the opportunity to become involved in many activities in the future. Some will be appropriate Section expenses and some will not. In the event that the mother is seeking contribution from the father, she must give notice of the activity and the cost. 3) Spousal support is requested by the wife. She does not seek periodic support but rather a lump sum payment to cover her tuition at the Atlantic School of Theology. 4) There is no basis for an unequal division as listed in s. 18 of the Matrimonial Property Act."
8_2007skpc1.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time.

The accused did not contribute to the remaining delay. There were some delays attributable to the accused in time until she was ready to enter pleas, delayed until she could have the matter rescheduled for trial, and otherwise, she appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charges set for trial. 4)The weather caused delay from November 29, 2006 to January 19, 2007, period of two months."
3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of his cattle getting into the plaintiff's canola field in late July, 1999. The plaintiff admits that his cattle were in the Plaintiff's crop on one occasion. The defendant says that there is no evidence that his cows were in it on any other occasion, and that such loss as was caused by his cattle is minimal. HELD: Judgment was granted in favour of the plaintiffs, together with pre-judgment interest from January 2000 and costs. Under both the present and pre-1977 statutes the legal situation was the same -- the cattle owner is strictly liable for damage caused by the straying cattle."

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action. The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution.","The bankrupt sought an order of disbursement of $1,750.00 from the Revenue Canada for a failed agreement and lease of his former business Red Bull Enterprises Ltd. He contended that the failure was caused by a protracted dispute with the Department of Highways over the right of Red Bull to occupy land owned by Highways. The bankrupt contended that s.173(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act prohibited disclosure of this information. HELD: 1)There was no evidence that the principle and exemption contained in s.295(5)(a of the Excise Tax Act would allow disclosure of the bankrupt's former business. 2)The bankrupt's evidence was that it was their own fault he stopped making payments because they didn't do what he wanted them to do. 3)The Court was not convinced that these proceedings were final in nature and dismissed the objection.  4)Section 173(1)of the Act requires that affidavit evidence must be based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge.  5)Section 241 of the Act prohibits disclosure of income tax remittances.  6)The information disclosed in paragraph 19 of the Affidavit of James Douglas Cook is confidential and disclosure is improper."

Defendant sentenced to fine of $25,000, from which the sum of $15,000 shall be paid to the Canadian Farmers' Disability Registry; defendant ordered to perform 160 hours of community service with respect to farm safety. The defendant was an individual and not a huge corporation, had been conscientious about safety issues prior to this incident and had endeavored to improve safety at his farm after the incident; the deceased had also failed in his responsibilities under the Act and was working with a significant blood alcohol content.","The defendant, who owned and operated a family dairy farm, pleaded guilty to an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act for failing to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons at the workplace. The defendant's guilty plea relates to the fact that on August 13, 2006, there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. He had been out all night at social event and had been drinking and had not slept. His blood alcohol concentration was significantly over the legal limit for operating any kind of vehicle. He made substantial changes to the farm since the tragedy, including building a new dairy barn. These plans were in the works before Mr. Boake's death but had been informed by the tragedy. He was in no condition to be operating equipment, which he needed to do to remove manure to the manure pit and placed himself at risk. His failure was in not arranging for an alternative to use the pit, alternatives that did exist at the time. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to a total penalty of $25,000. 1)It is material to me as well that the evidence in Exhibit 1, containing diagrams and photographs of the defendant's farm, and the submissions of Mr. Yuill indicate clearly that the defendant was conscientious about safety issues before August 13 2006 and has endeavored to address and improve safety at his farm since his death. The farm was inherently dangerous and farm work being inherently dangerous, accidents are daily risk. This was a case where safety was a daily risk and the defendant took steps to improve safety. 2)The defendant's failure was not in failing to secure the barricade which had its damaged barricade removed while a new one was on order. Punishment should be mitigated by his lesser degree of culpability. He also has no prior record for Occupational health and Safety act violations."

The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.  Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father. The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay. The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77. Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs.","The parties litigated the apportionment of custody and access rights and the quantification of child support and special expenses for their two children. The respondent did not persuade the Court to reduce his child support obligation. HELD: Costs were assessed against the respondent. Costs were payable at rate of $150 per month until paid in full, 2012 NSSC 267 (CanLII). 1) Income was imputed to the respondent by the Court. Income was expended to the applicant. The Court imputed an income level to her that Ms. Pellicer was prepared to accept prior to the commencement of the hearing ($25,000). 2) Costs of $3,000 are assessed for the respondent on the important parenting issue, the evidence established that the Applicant was the appropriate primary care parent. 3) The respondent's initiative in seeking to vary the existing order was not reasonable and responsible. It is my conclusion that Mr. Williams's submissions needlessly resulted in the expenditure of time and effort by all involved and delayed the issuance of an order.

d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order requiring the defendant to serve pre-certification notices to all persons who travelled with the plaintiff during the purposed class. The defendant brought two separate notices of motion requesting that the plaintiff be examined on her affidavit. HELD: The application for examination was dismissed. 1)It is important to note that we are in the pre certification stage of this proceeding. This is still an 'action' and not a 'class action'. The action is defined under s. 14 of the Class Action Act as meaning 'an action that defined the Queen's Bench Act, 1998'. The purpose of the motion is to give the defendant the opportunity to provide notice to potential class members. 2)The wording of the Moore affidavit creates a concern about the suspension of time limitations. It is not necessary to follow the usual practices and application of the common law regarding civil litigation. The practices and the implementation of The Rules of Court apply. The practice and implementation of the Rule 82(6) and s. 24 of our Act in my view precludes this type of examination. 3)The Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when the relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications in some other lawful manner. The Court will not be able to broaden the scope of Ottenbreit J.'s decision to allow for examination of Ms. Moore."
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. The respondent was 60 years old and the appellant was 53. The parties had separated in 2003 after 24 years of marriage following two years of cohabitation. At the time of the judgment, the respondent had been diagnosed with breast cancer and had had surgery followed up by radiation. She was receiving social assistance in the amount of $14,000 annually. The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining Catherine on the basis that she was over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) It was incumbent on the respondent on the review application to establish she was unable to become self sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she had made no effort at all to do so within the year allocated by the Ottenbreit order and prior to the filing of the notice of motion, and little effort between that time and the hearing of the application. 2) The order of Sandomirsky J. is set aside and the respondent is ordered to pay $600 per month. 3) The respondent's application for costs is dismissed."
c_1995canlii4546.txt,"The applicant sought a declaration that the province was responsible for providing school buildings for delivery of the public school program and that when buildings must be leased, the province bore the associated costs. The applicant, which leased six school buildings from the Roman Catholic Church, submitted the respondent was required to reimburse the applicant for leasing costs. For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs. Where the Minister received a request in the proper form and where it was determined leases were necessary, the leasing costs would be the respondent's responsibility.","The applicant school board is seeking a declaration that the Province of Nova Scotia is responsible to provide school buildings required for the delivery of a basic Public School Program to the Cape Breton Board. Included in the fifty-five schools are six school buildings leased by the school board from the Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Antigonish or other entities of the Roman Catholic Church (the ""Church""). It is the Province bears the responsibility for the negotiations and payment of rental costs associated with the leases. The issue is whether the Minister of Education (the 'Minister') is required to pay the cost of such a lease. HELD: Where the Minister has received a request in the proper form and determined, with the approval of the Governor in Council, that it is necessary to lease a school building in order to meet the Province's statutory obligation, the cost is the responsibility of the Province. The lease costs are to the same extent as would be the cost for supplying the building free of costs. It would not include those expenses associated with operating the building. Absent the report, under s. 33(7)(d) of the Education Act, there is no obligation on the Province to fund the lease."
7_1996canlii7107.txt,"The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600. The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amount of on-going maintenance of $600 per month for his 2 daughters. An order suspending enforcement of arrears during periods when the respondent is unemployed was granted. HELD: 1)The father was ordered to pay child support of $300 per month during months when his gross monthly income is $2,200 or greater and $150 per month when his adjusted gross income is less than $2200. The father was to pay $200 per month on arrear in addition to the on-go child support obligation. 2)The court ordered the father to pay monthly child support at $1,200 for a total of $25,600. 3)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance benefits.

b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment of March 19, 1999 insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that reserve on the matter of costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The evidence now showed that substantial offers were made through counsel. The applicant argues that the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and that the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: 1)The Court ordered fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000, together with disbursements.  2)The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The total recovery of $230,000 is close to the offer of $250,000 made in September of 1996. 3)The court did not hear argument on the issue of costs at trial; there is a substantial monetary difference between party and party costs awarded in the judgment, and the amount awarded in that case. 4)It is not appropriate for the Court to fix costs in lump sum.  5)In fixing costs, the court reviewed the principles in Nalder v. Hawkins (1833), Myl. K. 243; 39 E.R. 38 (Q.B.).

The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order that determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the respondent's pension plan during negotiations which took place during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with brief written reasons to follow. 1)There was no contract that the judge could enforce. The parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or instalment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicates such an intention in this case.  2)The court reviewed the evidence and concluded that settlement should not be enforced by the court if it is 'obviously incomplete'. 3)The Court reviewed the reasoning of the Unified Family Court in Zimmerman v. Zimmerman (1992), 104 Sask. R. 150, at p. 153. 4) and found that the Court was not dealing with complete agreements settling or purporting to settle all aspects of the actions."

The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens.

The sole issue was whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia regarding the motor vehicle accident which occurred in the Province of Quebec because Nova Scotia is a forum non conveniens.

This right is subject to the defendants' right to try to establish that the forum chosen is forum non- conveniens and that a more convenient forum exists elsewhere. 2)The substantive law of the place where the injury occurred was the law of Nova Scotia. The court reviewed the briefs and found that Nova Scotia was a forum. 3)The court considered the factors set out in O’Brien vs. Canada and Oakley vs. Barrie, and considered the factual submissions that have been made on behalf of the respondent in this application and that is the conclusion that have reached. 4)It was an entirely different question as to what law will apply to a trial here. The applicant appeared to have argued a determination of question of law but the respondent has not really made any submissions of substance concerning forum non. The applicants have not provided a lot of information about the circumstances surrounding the accident such as whether there were any witnesses and where they may be resident; police whether report was filed; whether anybody investigated the accident; whether any of them were seen by doctors and, if so, where they are located and whether they might be called to testify at trial. The substantive law that governs the conduct of the trial will be the law here. 5)If there is a procedural problem, a problem arising from procedural law, before or during trial, that problem will undoubtedly be determined in accordance with the procedural law of a place of trial. 6)The applicant was unsuccessful with respect to questions arising from forum conveniens, and the Court was left to decide what to do about costs."

e_2010skca8.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows: Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent. If any directions should be required in relation to the execution of the order, the parties are given leave to informally apply for such directions through the Registrar's office.","Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under s. 487.051(3). The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence.

b_2008nspc5.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked when he was found operating an all terrain vehicle (ATV) on a highway. Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along a highway in the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia. At the time his driver's license was revoked, he was driving a prohibited vehicle on the highway under s. 11 of the Motor Vehicle Act. The defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2) do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since his 'driver's license' was revoked. HELD: The accused was not guilty of driving a motor vehicle on a highway while his 'license was revoked' was dismissed. The only issue at this trial is whether this makes the accused guilty of the offence of driving on the road while his licence was revoked contrary to s.287(2). The offence was committed when the accused's ATV was operating on public highways and he was not lawfully licensed to drive it.  1)It seems apparent, therefore, that one must consider the context in which the words “motor Vehicle” are used within the sections of the motor vehicle act to determine whether the provision applies to the use of ATV’s or other prohibited vehicles. 2)The word ‘motor’ is used within s.2(m) to determine if the provision applied to the uses of ATVs. The word “vehicle” is used in the same context as'vehicle' and the phrase “jotor vehicle registered or required to be registered under this Act.” It is argued that since there is no nexus between his driving of the ATV, the revocation of his driver’S license and the charge before the court is not the charge for the court. 3)The accused could not have obtained a license to drive an ATv on the highways because it was a prohibited motor vehicle. He was vehicle of the wrong type or class to get license. 4)The words 'driver’ means license issued under this act to drive motor vehicle upon the highway.  5) The accused could have been charged with an offence of operating an off-highway vehicle while his license was cancelled, revoked or suspended. 6)It was vehicle that could not be subject to the same obligations."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge found the accused guilty of dangerous driving and assault. The court reviewed the evidence and found that the accused had intentionally driven in a manner which he knew created a danger for others, and drove in such a manner that the complainant did not consent to the application of force. The Court reviewed the trial judge's decision in Wiebe, 2011 SKQB 389 (CanLII), 368 Sask. R. 541. The standard of review is not whether the conclusion was correct, or even if an appellate court would have interpreted the evidence differently. This is whether there is evidence upon which a trier of fact properly instructed could have reasonably reached the verdict."
e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. The Lawless have an English speaking background. They attended an English language school for two years. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children's provisional approval to attend a French language school would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The family applied for an interlocutory injunction, alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. HELD: The application to dismiss the claim was reserved. The court found that it was in the best interests of the children to continue attending the school and that the court would facilitate their transfer to another school."
4_2000canlii2523.txt,"The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval. In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","The applicant land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in 1997 and received the same in 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. After several initial attempts the applicant submitted its last plan for final approval on March 14, 2000. The next day, the application was determined to be incomplete for essentially two reasons: 1) it failed to meet the newly incorporated road standards; and 2) one of the bearings on the plan was missing. The Municipality relied upon s. 278 of the Municipal Government Act in its submission that the higher road standard represented a major obstacle for the Applicant. The Applicant took the position that because it received tentative approval before the new road standard was incorporated, its application should be grand-parented and it should only have to meet road standards as they existed at the time it received the tentative approval. Technically in the case at bar it was not refused it was simply declared incomplete. This was significant in light of s. 250(3) which gives the development officer his jurisdiction. The application was incomplete and the applicant was entitled to a declaration that the application is complete."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation entered into a letter agreement with the defendant to represent its share of the plaintiff's energy savings, but agreed to pay 50% of every energy savings enjoyed for a period of sixty months, provided such savings were the result of whatever of the defendant's recommendations were approved by and implemented by the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought to set aside the default judgment on the basis that the letter agreement did not constitute an enforceable contract; third, if it did, that the plaintiff was not liable under the contract to the defendant and fourth, that it was not going to file a defence in Ontario. The defendant applied pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06 (Rule 12.07) to set up a default judgment in Nova Scotia. The matter was originally set down for Regular Chambers to be heard on March 9, 1995. In that case, the plaintiff sought a leave to take default under Civil Procedure rule 12.03 (1), because the statement of claim had combined a request for declaratory relief with a claim for what I consider to be liquidated damages, such a procedural omission did not materially affect the defendant."

Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issue of divorce, custody and access was disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The issue of access was to be mutually agreed upon between the respondent and the child who was now 18 years of age. The petitioner was to pay one-half of the cost of extra-curricular activities as set forth on Exhibits P-9 and P-10 and was to contribute one-third of the costs of any future extra-ricular activities which the parties mutually agreed to. HELD: 1)The petitioner spent $400 per week of day care for Breeanna which equals $400. The total costs of $440 were to be paid by the petitioner and the respondent in their respective percentage based on the Guidelines. 2)The respondent is to pay 1/2 of the $948 per month for the petitioner's two children, namely, Kaitlyn, born November 1992, and Breeanna, born May 1996. Given the fact that after the respondent pays child support (including the extra costs) the income of the petitioner will be nearly the same, the Court declined to order any spousal support. 3)The court found that the respondent stands in loco parentis in respect of Breeanna. It is agreed that the petitioner receives the sum of $300 per month from the natural father of Randy. The court ordered $300.00 as payment for the two natural children of the marriage and $40.00 per month is to be taken and added to the Guideline amount to obtain the total payable for the three children. 4)The Court found that there was no evidence as to the tax implications regarding matrimonial property although the respondent attempted to introduce such evidence through an expert.

The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government of Saskatchewan sought an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars, and in default of so doing striking the offending portions of the statement of claim. HELD: In the circumstances, the Government was not prepared to strike the phrases complained of. The conduct of examinations for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action. The pleadings support a claim for damages for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of trust."
