The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases. The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale. The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata. As at November 1, 2017, the principal and interest owing on the non-purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,250. The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment. It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage. The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro rata calculation for the nonpurchase portion of the mortgage, that is, 8 percent of the total costs incurred.  HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to a deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested. It was also entitled to judgment against the mortgagee for eight percent of the solicitor-client costs, condominium fees and property management charges.","FIAT: The plaintiff bank applies by notice of application for a deficiency judgment pertaining to the non-purchase money portion of the outstanding indebtedness to the defendant, Doreen Pearl Partridge, pertaining to her non-Purchpee money portion pursuant to her mortgage. RBC also applies to have its lawyers' costs assessed on a solicitor-client basis. The issue is whether the pro rata distribution applies solely to the indebtedness of principal and accrued interest or applies to all costs under the mortgage. HELD: The issue here is whether such costs should be subject to the pro-rata calculation of the non‑purchase fee mortgage which is 8% of the total outstanding mortgage amount. The pro ratus calculation of non-PPP money mortgage is 8%. In this case, the pro rate calculation of this non-PUP money Mortgage is 8 % of the amount of the mortgage amount and RBC is entitled to judgment against Partridge for 8% per the solicitor- and condominium fees and property management charges.  1) The pro-rate calculation of that non- PPP money mortgageis 8% and the property management fees and their charges ought to be added to the deficiency judgment, along with the prorated principal and interest due. 2) The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal was not required to address the proration of solicitor-costs because the parties consented to having the matter remitted to the Queen's Bench judge. However, Walker is instructive in explaining the policy objective of s.8 of the LCRA. The protection of s.(c) of the LRA continues to apply to only that portion of its mortgage loan that was given to secure the purchase price of the land. It logically follows that the protection of S(c) 8(c)) pertains to all other costs which are part of the remaining mortgage amount, the Pro rata calculation is 8%, and the condominium and hotel fees and the total property management charge are recoverable under the terms of the Mortgage. 3) The respondent is entitled, pursuant to Rule 10‑47(5)(c) and as set out in Rule 10-47(4)(c), the Queen’s Bench Rules and its corresponding Form 10‑46C, to have the deficiency for principal and interests owed under the Mortgage in the amount requested. The Saskatchewan court was not necessary to address costs of solicitor‑client costs because the Parties consented thereto. However the issue is if such costs ought to subject to taxation. The respondent was"
e_2016skca29.txt,"HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent member of the Regina City Police Service who pushed and punched the complainant outside of a police precinct. The Provincial Court judge did not accept the complainant's evidence that he had been assaulted and instead sentenced the officer to imprisonment. The Crown appealed to Queen's Bench as a summary conviction appeal court, and succeeded in finding the trial judge erred in finding that the trial court judge had misinterpreted s. 25(1) and s. 34(1). The appeal court judge instructed himself to disregard the evidence of the Crown's expert and to measure the force used by the officer against the complainant to be proportionate to the assault caused bodily harm. The court found that the officer was not acting in a reasonable manner and that, in fact, he was using more force than was necessary to defend himself or effect an arrest. The officer's response of force was no more than necessary in all of the circumstances and the Court found that in assessing whether there is an air of reality to the proportionality requirement, that is whether the officer's use of force met the proportional requirement, the trial judges erred by not considering the evidence and in failing to do so, the verdict was entered. The appeal judge er erred because he failed to consider the nature and extent of the threat, the circumstances in which the officer found himself and his ability to react to the challenge, and in disregarding the evidence, the jury found that officer was reasonably justified in kicking the complainant in the abdomen, driving him backwards and causing him to fall backwards, and while the complainant was not seeking to block the officer’s path, the officer did engage in a verbal altercation with the complainant and kicked him in the stomach. The complainant suffered a fractured jaw and a fractured skull as a result of the punch and the officer had to take steps to take himself back. The accused was much smaller and in better shape than the complainant. The trial judge instructed the officer not to kick the complainant because he was not expecting the impact of the assault. The judge instructed him to disregard evidence of Mr. Stonechild and the complainant, and to not allow the appellant to get too close to the complainant during the arrest. This decision was appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside and the sentence of guilty found to be in breach of s. 29(1), but the officer is found guilty of assault causing bodily harm because the trial officer did not err in using less force than is necessary. The evidence of how the officer reacted to the attacker was considered in light"
8_2012skpc79.txt,"The accused's neighbour disliked the accused and alleged that the accused drove his vehicle into hers. The police arrested the accused and found a fob that operated the locks on the doors of the vehicle and the engine hood of the accused's vehicle was warm. The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges. The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous. The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.","The accused was charged with two counts of driving over.08. The first charge was of driving while intoxicated. The second was of using a fob that was associated with the accused's vehicle to smash into it. The accused had stated that the fob and keys were for the accused. The defence argued that the police had the requisite subjective and objective grounds to detain the accused as they had found the vehicle that was being operated by the accused (who had stated in his application that he had'shot himself in the knee' several times while in detention). HELD: The accused was found not guilty of both charges.  1)The police had no reasonable grounds to search the accused when they first learned of his location. They searched him for safety, but failed to find anything that could be of assistance to them. When they were able to locate the vehicle, they searched him without difficulty for approximately 11 minutes. The search and seizure of the accused’s vehicle and the retrieval of the evidence from his pocket were in total breaches of the defence’ s.2 right to be free from an unreasonable search and seizures. 2)The defence excluded the evidence of the fobs and keys. They were not relevant to the investigation of the offence for which the officer had first been aware of the vehicle’d been operating and then, when he was advised of the reason for his detention, did not advise him that he could consult counsel. 3)The exclusion of the relevant evidence of where the officer was concerned about the safety of others may undermine the accuseds right to freedom of expression."
d_2013skqb90.txt,"The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","The trial judge found the plaintiff had proven liability with respect to a damaged triple-ply beam and awarded damages for repair and other repairs in an amount much higher than damages would have been for the triple-ple beam notwithstanding that liability as to the concrete grade beam was not established at trial. The trial judge also awarded damages to the appellant for repair of broken concrete grade beams and for other repairs, in an amounts much higher then would have be for the Triple-ply. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to the respondent. 1) The trial Judge made no palpable and overriding error regarding the calculation of damages. The court found no evidence of bias on the part of the trial judge. The verdict was appealed. 2) The appeal court made no evidential or overriding error in the calculation as to damages. 3) The verdict of guilty as charged was dismissed."
4_1994canlii4625.txt,"At trial in Provincial Court, the accuseds called no evidence and were convicted. They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance. 2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds. 3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.","The Crown called no evidence as to the cause of the injuries, which were the result of an assault. The appellants alleged two insufficiencies in the evidence: (i) the absence of any expert evidence that the injuries sustained by the victim resulted from any blows such as kicks or punches and as such were theresult of an assaulted; and (ii) there was insufficient evidence to prove that an offence of assault or indeed an offence under the Criminal Code had been committed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The procedural point was not supported by the evidence. The evidence contained no substantive entitlement to address a jury last and, therefore, was not an unreasonable remedy. 2)The appeal was not dismissed without a substantive curative error of law."

The respondent was employed part-time doing minimum wage jobs and was responsible for the household duties and raising their children. The petitioner's annual income was $50,000 at the time of separation, but escalated to $200,000 in 1992 and was prone to great fluctuation. The respondent was to have custody of the children. She sought spousal and child support and an unequal division of assets. Ordering support and an unequal division of assets. The court extensively reviewed the case of Moge v. Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L.(3d) 345 (S.C.C.) and found that marriage and child care responsibilities hinder a wife's role in the workplace. The court awarded $4500 per month as spousal and child support, plus an additional $500 while the wife retrained. The court considered this an appropriate case for an unequal division of matrimonial assets in the respondent's favour. Finding that the awards were still not sufficient to satisfy the respondent's needs, a lump sum award of $18,000 was ordered. On appeal.","The parties, along with the respondent, decided to divorce. The respondent, who had made significant contributions to the marriage, sought an unequal division of matrimonial assets and services, including an unequal distribution of matron and child support. The parties, who both had children of their own, separated after a period of cohabitation in 1991. The husband sought to have the collateral mortgage removed from the matrimonial residence and to have it replaced with an additional mortgage. The court was satisfied that the physical division represented an unequal divide in favour of the respondent and that it was necessary that the mortgage be removed to enable her to resume her employment. The trial judge was to determine the practicability of obtaining economic self-sufficiency under s. 15 of the Divorce Act."

He was required to discontinue his studies for failure to meet academic standards for promotion. The applicant appealed his dismissal and was unsuccessful throughout. He applied to the Court for an order of certiorari to quash the decision of the Academic Appeals Committee and the University Bylaws Committee Council and an order reinstating him as a student at the College of Medicine pending resolution of his appeal. HELD: The Court found that the Bylaws Committee Council exceeded its jurisdiction by reviewing the previous decisions made and drawing the conclusion that they were made fairly and properly. The Bylaw Committee determined the merits of the applicant's appeal and determined that it was not necessary to convene a full appeal board. There is nothing in the University policy to suggest that the Bylaws Committee has that power. The Bylaws Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is quashed. The matter is returned to the Bylaws Committee to determine whether the applicant's appeal falls within the policy on student appeals and academic matters. The portion of the application requesting reinstatement of the applicant as a student pending the resolution of his appeal is dismissed. The applicant has a marginal academic record and there are a limited number of placements in the College of Medicine. It does not make sense to displace another student or require the College of Medicine to train a marginal student on a potentially temporary basis.,"The applicant was required to discontinue his studies for failure to meet the academic standards for promotion. He applied to quash the Academic Appeals Committee and the University Bylaws Committee of Council, alleging that they exceeded their jurisdiction by reviewing the merits of his appeal. HELD: The certiorari application was dismissed. The applicant was successful quashing the decision of the Academic Appeal Committee and sought an order reinstating him as a student at the College of Medicine pending resolution of his appeals. The court reviewed the relevant facts and determined that the Academic Review Committee had determined the merits and therefore a full appeal board was not necessary. The appeal board should be constituted to determine if the applicant's appeal fell within s. 1(a) of Part VI of the policy on student appeals and academic matters. 1) The applicant had been unsuccessful in quashing a decision of The College of Physicians and Surgeons Committee. The College did not have a proper forum to engage the applicant in his application as it was not a proper venue for it. 2) The College's admissions policy promotes the promotion of student success. The Board was properly constituted and properly constituted. 3) The Board's mandate was not to interfere with the applicant’s academic assessment nor to determine whether his appeal fell under s.1(a). 4) The court was not satisfied the College’S admissions policy had been properly promoted. The university was subject to some measure of judicial control. The Bylaw Committee exceeded its jurisdiction. It was not appropriate to usurp the function of the Board and review the material to determine that the matter should be remitted to the appeal board under Part V, para.3.

The deputy rentalsman ordered that the landlord should have possession, but also ordered that the last two months rent would abate in order to assist the tenants with their moving costs. The landlord appealed the abatement of rent and a chambers judge reversed the deputy rentalsman. The tenants sought and were granted leave to appeal the chambers judge and this appeal resulted. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The chambers judge could only reverse the deputy rentalsman if he exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law. 2)The deputy rentalsman had jurisdiction to order an abatement of rent pursuant to S.47(4) of the Act. 3)The jurisdiction is a discretionary one. The court will therefore show some deference to a decision of the rentalsman involving this jurisdiction. In this case the deputy rentalsman made no reversible error.",At issue in the tenancy dispute was whether the deputy rentalsman had the authority to abate rent on the basis that he had 'exceeded his jurisdiction' pursuant to s. 49(1) of The Residential Tenancies Act. The deputy rentalsmen's decision to grant leave to the deputy landlord to do so amounted to an error of law or jurisdiction. The Deputy rentalsman appealed. Appeal allowed; decision of the deputy rentalman restored. Although the deputy had the power to abrate rent under s. 47(4) the Court's function was limited to finding the error of Law or jurisdiction and to finding whether the landlord had the right to possess the premises.

The first ground of appeal alleged the trial judge was in error by permitting the complainant to testify behind a screen without first conducting a voir dire and by relying solely upon the representations of the Crown counsel to the effect that she would be uncomfortable without a screen. The defence counsel originally suggested that she read it over.

The Queen. 3)The court reviewed the record of the trial, considered the evidence before it and concluded that there was evidence before the trial Judge reasonably supported the conclusion that he reached.

c_2014skqb284.txt,HELD: The court dismissed both applications. The respondent’s voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income was insufficient grounds to vary his child support application. The court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances with regard to the petitioner’s application.,"The respondent father has applied to reduce his child support obligation and to extinguish arrears of child support as a result of him quitting his job and embarking on an apprenticeship program to become an electrician. Both parties have two children, the children of whom reside with the respondent. The respondent father was found to be earning $75,000 per year and was in excess of $10,000 in arre arreary. The petitioner mother applied to become the sole custodian parent of the parties' two daughters. Both applications to vary child support were granted. The final order for child support is sought to be varied pursuant to s. 10 of the Family Maintenance Act, 1997 in which there must be a material change in circumstances to warrant variation of the child support order. The preliminary question is therefore whether voluntary change constitutes a material or material change. The Court was unable to find that there has been a material Change in circumstances as required to vary the existing order, and the petitioner's application to be added to the existing Order. HELD: The final application for child child support was granted. It was apparent the respondent was less than an involved father and had little involvement in the lives of the children. The application to vary support was dismissed. The father's voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income is found to have been insufficient grounds to vary his support obligation.

9_2010skqb122.txt,"FIAT: This is an application for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act requiring the respondents or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of construction equipment. The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008. Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head. In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration. Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment. In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment. Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096. September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head. The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken. On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness. As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment. Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008. The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009. This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession. As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act. When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009. The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof. Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent 101138096 free and clear of the claim of the applicant.","FIAT: The application by Inland for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993, requiring the respondents to deliver four pieces of equipment.

In the intervening years, the parties have had two more children in their Custody and pursuant the agreement and the divorce judgement no maintenance is payable. The husband has had an income of well over $50,000 and has improved his ability to pay maintenance and is paying substantially more support than he did in 1992. The Court found that the husband had improved his income during this time and accordingly there was an order eliminating the arrearages from January to the current."
b_1996canlii6818.txt,"At issue was the determination of the quantum of spousal and child support and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The respondent's supplementary allowances were taken into consideration in finding a gross salary of $53,000.00 per annum. Due to an injury he was no longer able to work overtime but was working full-time. Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage. The frequent moves due to the husband's employment had disrupted the petitioner's employment and university education. However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse. 3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. Shares in joint names were divided equally. Other assets were divided equally. 4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits. The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date. The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner. 5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income. $600.00 per month per child was awarded.  6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse. The petitioner's future plans were realistic. $800 per month until June 1, 2001 was awarded for spousal support.  7)Costs including one-half of the cost of preparing reports and pension valuations were awarded to the petitioner.","The parties agreed on their divorce and that Mary be granted custody of the children with reasonable access to John. There remains for determination the quantum of maintenance for the children, spousal maintenance and the division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The parties were not able to agree on the quantum or realistic figure to use for the determination of the maintenance for them. The respondent was to pay $600 per month per child for a period of 15 years. Given the relative income of the parties and current income tax implications (including inflation) the termination and retirement method is the route to go. 2)The respondent was ordered to pay the sum of $600.00 per month for child support and spousals. The amount of the pension plan was to be determined by the parties' gross yearly income as determined by their gross gross yearly incomes as determined in the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Guidelines. 3)The evidence showed that somewhere in between (preferably the mid-point) the terminating and retirement methods were the route. 4)The combination method was an acceptable method of valuation in this case."

HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)The relief sought did not fall within any of the wording of s63(2) of the Personal Property Security Act and therefore there was no jurisdiction to grant the relief requested. The application was simply an attempt to end run the action commenced by the respondent. 2)The applicant was not seeking to remedy a wrong with respect to the seizure or preservation of the collateral but was seeking a remedy pursuant to the Limitations of Civil Rights Act.

3_1999canlii12362.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction of sexual assault causing bodily harm on the ground the trial judge erred in preventing cross-examination of the complainant. The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother. The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter. The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her. The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment. The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person. The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history. HELD: Appeal allowed. The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex. The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred. The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant in respect of the same assault is obvious. That question has a direct bearing on her credibility.",The appellant was convicted of sexual assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 272(c) of the Criminal Code. He appealed the conviction on the ground that the trial judge erroneously interpreted s. 276 of the Code to prevent proper cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The trial judge failed to consider whether s. 277 of the code should be interpreted as having application beyond the incidence of consensual sex. The Court of Appeal was of the view that s. 275 is not applicable to non-consensual sexual activity. 2)The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather about a previous complaint of a sexual assault which was understood the intent was to indicate the complaintant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. 3)The Court of Justice agreed with the conclusion reached in R. v. Vanderest that the relevance of a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant regarding the same assault is obvious. It does not raise the issue of the sexual activity that the complainant may have had. That question had a direct bearing on the complainant's credibility.

6_2001canlii365.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving (Criminal Code ss.255(1) and 253(a)) and with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08 (Criminal Code ss.253(b) and 255(1)). Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary? HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08). Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.  1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed. The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case. In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence. It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.  5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings. Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded. 6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test. Both the subjective and objective tests were met. The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test). Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes. However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence. The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle. While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied. There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel. He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver. Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable. It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city. The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there. It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant. On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied. There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected. The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle while over.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)) of the Criminal Code. The accused was stopped by the RCMP on suspicion of impaired driving. At roadside, the officer noted a smell of liquor and blood alcohol coming from the accused. The officer demanded that the accused provide a breath sample. The defence refused, stating that they were looking for a 'Borkenstein' breathalyzer. The roadside screening was performed and the accused failed the roadside test. As result, the police officer made a demand for the sample, pursuant to s254(3) of the Code. He then demanded that he provide a sample of the accused's blood alcohol content. The police officer advised that he preferred that someone else administer the test when he is the arresting officer and he did not go to Martensville or Warman. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The accused's credibility was not established once the application was made. 2) The defence had a reasonable and probable reason to seek a sample. 3) The request was made in timely fashion, not for purposes of delay or with a genuine desire to have the appropriate tests conducted. The request for representative ampoules was not made lightly. There was no process to track cases and when they are concluded, the accused was advised of his right to counsel. The requested production of ampoule was a matter for the Court as it was not available to the Crown at the time of the request. The Court was not satisfied with the defence's explanation that the requested production was a 'live issue'. 4) The Court found that the failure of the Crown to produce representative ampounles constituted a violation of s. 8 of the Charter. The application to discharge the onus of proving the accused’s right to lawyer was dismissed and the Court was left with the burden of establishing the accused had not been properly served on the court."
3_1991canlii4569.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years. The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena. The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial. He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued. The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial. The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear. He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial. Dismissing the appeal, (1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences.","The appellant was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon. He applied for leave to appeal against the sentence of 8 years imprisonment and for leave by reason of leave to return to stand trial. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's evidence as to the nature of the complainant's consent was reasonably capable of giving relevant evidence, and that it was not unreasonable for the appellant to have thought that the offer of a drive home had been made by the complainant to her own convenience. The appellant had no idea that the knife would be used in committing the assault. He had no reason to raise the issue with the trial judge. It was clear that the trial Judge intended to raise a reasonable possibility that the complainant would offer a reasonable excuse for her failure to participate in the trial, but he failed to do so. Allowing the appeal and ordering the sentence, that it would not be fit to return the appellant for trial, that his failure to make an adequate defence of his right to a jury trial was beyond reasonable doubt, and it was beyond the reasonable reach of the Court to grant him leave to apply for leave."

The grounds of her appeal were that the trial judge erred in determining that she was impaired, and that the trial judge otherwise misconstrued and misapplied the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Both grounds of appeal raised questions of fact. Findings of fact are not to be reversed on appeal unless it can be established that the trial judge has made some palpable and overriding error which affected her assessment of the facts. 2)The Court's task is not to retry the case or substitute its own decision.

The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in determining the degree of impairment by alcohol or drug required before a conviction could be entered.

4_2009skca44.txt,"The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners. Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian. It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","The appellant prepared a HomePak Application on behalf of the respondents. The respondents signed and he submitted to SGI a standard 'comprehensive perils' home coverage policy with Fine Arts Rider for the Swarovski collection with an estimated value of approximately $9,950. The trial judge concluded that the appellant was in breach of his duty of care because he failed to properly identify the nature and extent of the Homeowners' existing insurance coverage, which he could easily have done by carefully reviewing the support file. The appellant admitted that he undertook to provide the Homeowner with insurance coverage equal to or better than the one provided by SGI. The appeal was allowed. The court found that the trial judge's conclusion that the respondents had not properly reviewed their prior SGI policy and that SGI contributed equally to the Home Owners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and constituted negligence at law, did not rest on the evidence. The evidence showed that the respondent had not made any enquiries as directed by the trial court as he did with the Homebuyers' insurance policy and was available only through an SGI broker. The respondent was not aware that the Home owners had any SGI coverage. The Court found that S.GI and the appellant were not involved in the discussions about the coverage."
8_2010skqb467.txt,"Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year. This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates. In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration. The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme. The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed. While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case. While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages. It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations. It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation. The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","The plaintiff union represents approximately 11,000 health care workers employed by the four defendant regional health authorities. The current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) covers the period April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2012. The formal CBA was not signed until October 2010. The plaintiffs seek a mandatory interlocutory injunction requiring the defendants to make the retroactive adjustment payments before the end of this year. They also seek an order requiring the parties to proceed with an expedited arbitration before an arbitrator appointed by the court. HELD: The motion to strike is dismissed. The court is without jurisdiction to determine the issue pleaded based on the CBA and the Weber principle. It is not appropriate for the court to grant an injunction requiring defendants to comply with the required retroactive assessment payments before they make. The proposed timeline for payments by the defendants is significantly beyond the endof the 2010 calendar year. The plaintiff union will entertain submissions as to costs if counsel so request. The claim now before the court is not necessarily a nullity. Although it can otherwise appropriately be struck pursuant to Rules 99 and 173 it can nevertheless subsist if only to provide a platform of pleading to support an application for interlocutorutory relief. As the defendants concede that the court was without jurisdiction, it is necessary to determine whether the plaintiffs are entitled to mandatory injunctive relief. The Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to deal with this issue."
7_2010skqb33.txt,"The accused was convicted of common assault, break and enter and commit assault and assault causing bodily harm and his former common law spouse was the complainant in each instance. The accused also entered guilty pleas to three charges stemming from breaches of no-contact conditions with the same complainant plus two charges of obstruction of justice by attempting to dissuade the same complainant from giving evidence. The RCMP had to execute a Feeney warrant to locate the complainant in the accused basement. The Crown sought an order declaring the accused a dangerous offender. HELD: The accused was designated a dangerous offender and was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period on the conviction pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and received time served on the remaining eight charges. The evidence is conclusive that the offence for which the accused was convicted was a serious personal injury offence. The evidence was conclusive that the accused constitutes a threat to other persons because of his pattern of repetitive behaviour and persistent aggressive behaviour. The accused's First Nation would provide support for the accused but its support system is presently non-existent. The Court rejected the expert opinions recommending a long term offender order as being appropriate.","HELD: The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and of obstructing justice by dissuading or attempting to dissuade the complainant from testifying. The accused had been previously convicted of several breaches of no contact conditions. The most serious of the offences was that he had assaulted the complainant. The Crown applied for an order that the accused be declared a dangerous offender because the Crown had not proven either of the breaches. The defence argued that the Court could use the evidence of both the breaches of NOF conditions and the evidence that the offender had been moved from his home reserve to a First Nation. The Court of Appeal addressed the Gladue factors in R. v. Lemaigre (2004), [TWLII], [2004] 1 SCC 46. HELD: 1) The accused is a dangerous person because he has committed multiple breaches of No Fences. The facts of this offence leave no doubt that the Crown has proved that the indictable offence under s. 267(b) involved the use of violence against the complainant and this offence attracts a sentence of ten years. 2) The facts leave no question that the crown has proved the indictability offence under the Criminal code and the offences that led to the declaration of dangerous offender. The offence of assault is a serious personal injury offence as defined in Part XXIV of the Code. The offences that lead to the conclusion that the most serious threat to the safety of the community can be managed to an acceptable level are those committed when the offender has been convicted of multiple breaches, namely of no-contact conditions and of attempts to dissuad the complainant of testifying. There are other offences that fall within the third criterion, namely that of a serious bodily harm offence. The fourth criterion is that the offence of assaulting causing bodily injury is a'serious personal injury' offence as is the predicate offence. 3) The offence is a threat to public safety as defined by s. 753(a) of the code. The court found that the offences which led to this declaration were serious personal injuries and that the respondent had committed them to the level of a common nuisance. The sentencing principles articulated in R.' v. Labbe (2004) were applicable. The judge found that, because the respondent was an aboriginal, the court was required to consider the prospects of eventually reducing the risk to an unacceptable level and that there was a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community. The respondent was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. 1) There"
b_2000canlii4425.txt,"Plaintiff suffered soft tissue damage to knee when he tripped over a dolly cart in a building supply warehouse. Knee became swollen and infected and he was off work for 12 days. He claimed for pain and suffering, loss of income and loss of earning capacity. Plaintiff was found 60% responsible for injuries and defendant 40% responsible. Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks. The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury. However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door. He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously. The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path. The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial. There was no evidence to support a claim for diminishment of earning capacity.","The plaintiff tripped over a 'dolly-cart' while attending at the premises of the defendant. He was attending to clear lumber for a job when he tripped and fell. He estimated the distance of 13 1/2 to be approximately 2.5 km. The court awarded the plaintiff $8,500 as general damages. The plaintiff had been involved in overseeing his business for many years and had limited his involvement in it to supervisory types of activities rather than in physical labour. He had limited time to visit his parents and grandparents. The plaintiffs residence was in the city and, during the remainder of 1995, he was required to hire additional employees to perform the work he had performed himself. The business was described as a commercial warehouse from which building supplies were sold. These circumstances were known to the plaintiff and as such he should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path as he proceeded towards the glass doors. The defendant's premises were described as commercial warehouse. Therefore, it was recognized that the presence of a 'cart' or 'doll' out of view would also be an 'unusual danger' notwithstanding knowledge of the presence in such dollies within the premises."

To do so it must be shown that a solicitor client relationship existed. There must not be a danger of the confidential information coming back to haunt the client. The court found that such a relationship did not exist in this instance. In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that the solicitor received information which is relevant to the matter at hand. The court found no such evidence of this possibility. It is no bar to representation by a solicitor that some former partners at a previous firm will be examined for discovery or called to testify.","The plaintiff pension plan was purchased by the defendant.

There was no conflict of interest between the general and specific counsel and the parties to the action. The law firm acted as a liaison between the applicants and the corporation.

The defendant proposed to open a pharmacy on the premises. Another tenant in the shopping centre already operated a drug store and their lease provided that no other tenant would operate a drug store in any part of their premises. The other tenant brought an application for a interim injunction against the defendant. The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises. The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial. Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration.","The plaintiff company applied for a permanent injunction against the defendant's proposed premises. The defendant had made a twenty-five year lease expiring in 2005 for 22,000 square feet. The lease provided that the lessee would use the premises only for the purposes of the retail sale of complete line of food products, as well as general retail merchandising, as carried on by the rest of the store. The purpose of the lease was to be more general retail sales. The essential aspects of the conduct alleged to constitute breach were known and uncontraverted. The potential, and the potential, for a substantial dispute of fact was not preclusive of an application under the proposed interim injunction. The court would not automatically engage in a prolonged examination of the merits just because a breach of the negative covenant is alleged."
d_2000skca131.txt,"The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence of 2.5 years for manslaughter on the grounds it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of deterrence and denunciation. HELD: A sentence of 5 years of imprisonment was imposed. The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent. The accused pled guilty, had no criminal record, did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victim who died from the wounds or of the other victim; she intervened to stop the beating although only after being satisfied the alleged the drug dealer had nothing to give the robbers.  The accused appeared to be doing well in the prison programs. The sentence of the co-accused who had a record of 40 previous convictions had been increased to the equivalent of more than 10 years imprisonment.","The 18 year old, who was charged with manslaughter in the death of the man who had been stabbed to death in the basement suite of the apartment of the appellant, pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter in respect of the deathof the appellant. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence, alleging it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of the law in respect OF deterrence, denunciation and separation. HELD: The appellant was sentenced to 2½ years imprisonment, and the sentence of the trial judge was set aside, and a sentence of 5 years imprisonment was imposed in lieu of the sentence. The appellant appealed. She had no criminal record, and was at large on bail awaiting trial on other charges. The sentence imposed by the trial court did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that the sentence be proportionate in the gravity and to the seriousness of the offences, nor did it achieve the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature.

5_2010nspc18.txt,"The on-site supervisor was convicted of two offences under the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter of the work area and failing to ensure that an intermediate or 'mid' guardrail was installed) after a mason was killed when he fell from scaffolding on the job site. Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell. The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew. In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations. The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard. Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall.","The 47 year old defendant, charged with failing to properly supervise, inspect and secure a scaffold or mid-rail, and in both cases, he committed an offence contrary to s. 74(1)(a) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act. He died as a result of his actions. The defendant was an hourly paid employee on the job who designed and constructed the formwork. He was working on a work platform supported by scaffolding that was approximately 13 feet above the concrete sidewalk when he placed one foot on the open edge of a false ceiling suspended by wires under the work platform. The platform collapsed and the defendant, his foreman, was ordered to inspect the scaffolding and to inspect it before work commenced. He received a fine of $28,000. The defendants were fined $8,050. The court found that the defendant had failed to meet the requirements of the Act and the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations and that he thereby committed an offense contrary to S. 74. It was not an issue of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the requirements for safety in the workplace, but of negligence. The actions of the defendant in placing the bricks under the false ceiling constituted negligence which resulted in the defendant falling off the work surface and into the concrete below. The deceased was working at heights without any fall protection measures in place and suffered serious injuries and was only 12 days after the incident."
b_2018skca65.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial. Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial. It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process.","The defendant applied for an adjournment following his conviction on a charge of fraud over $5,000. His counsel withdrew from the trial, and the defendant applied to have an adjournments granted. Application allowed; new trial ordered. Although the circumstances of this case did not appear to be in dispute, the Court found that the trial judge had a reasonable opportunity to consider the merits of the application and there was no evidence to suggest a deliberate plot to delay the trial. The defendant had ample opportunity to obtain counsel and his refusal to cooperate with counsel led to the refusal of Legal Aid. The failure to have counsel did not result in an unfair trial; the defendant's criminal record reflected the accused's degree of familiarity with the criminal justice system and legal aid programmes; the trial court found that, in the course of the trial the defendant had justifiably withdrawn his counsel; therefore, the adjournment request was not made against the defendant’s right to a fair trial and was therefore granted."
5_2005nssc172.txt,"The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children. Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard. The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency. Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders. Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed. Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling","The applicants applied for leave to terminate an order for permanent care and custody respecting their three children. The applicants had been fighting an old war, blaming the Agency for their past. They had placed the children in one home for adoption, and had deferred to their current spouses because they thought that they were being misdirected by the Agency. The spouses had taken anger management courses, had taken marriage counselling, and were working with the Agency to improve their parenting. They were both granted parenting courses, but the Agency opposed their application to terminate the order. The applicant had completed anger management training, and the husband had taken parenting courses. The wife had also completed marriage counselling but the husband was no longer available. The husband had recently taken parenting classes, but had not completed any of the required programs. The mother had recently received a parenting course from a psychologist, and felt that her parenting was abysmal. The father expressed frustration at the Agency's failure to provide stability and consistency to the children, and expressed frustration with their inability to parent. The Agency opposed the application to continue. The parents had been discussing the issues on the basis that they had not made significant progress in resolving the problems between them, and they had been unable to provide the children with the support and encouragement they needed to become better parents. The daughter had recently been diagnosed with ADD, and her symptoms were subject to self-report, subjective assessment. The psychiatrist agreed with the applicants that their symptoms were caused by anxiety, not depression, and that they would be better able to parent the children. She also believed that the medication had a positive effect on her. The family had been able to reconcile, and be better parents in the long term, and there was a real prospect that the children would be adopted by other families. The children would have a better future if their parents were involved in their lives, and their father was able to provide that support. The court found that the applicants had made significant changes in their life, and it was unlikely that they could have expected the Agency and their children to continue to be involved in such a relationship. The Court of Appeal ordered the parents to return the children to their parents. In the interim, the Agency had attempted to arrange marriage counselling and parenting courses for the children and had refused to allow them to have them return. The application for leave was granted in May 2005. The parties were granted access to the Agency in the fall of 2005. They have been granted parenting counselling for three years and the parenting assessment was completed in October 2004. The applications for"

The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to them in his affidavit. Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to this situation. If a party to an action is unable to enforce a concluded settlement, the pre-trial process becomes meaningless. The legislation never intended such a result. There was no suggestion that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settlement. Nor was it suggested the minutes were unclear or ambiguous. The defendant did not allege the settlement was amended or altered or that the balance of $15,000 does not remain owing.","The plaintiff applied for summary judgment pursuant to Queen's Bench Act rules 184A(1)(a) and s. 29 in accordance with minutes of settlement agreed to by the parties following a pre-trial conference.

HELD: The application was granted. 1)The defendant did not file any affidavit material in opposition to the application. The application for summary judgement was dismissed. 2)The plaintiff did receive the first installment of $5,000 from the defendant and the remaining $15,000 that was to be paid pursuant to the Minutes of Settlement.

c_2003skqb46.txt,"The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA. The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949. The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19. A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application. HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck. The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.  LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","The Attorney General applies to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The plaintiff claims that he was physically assaulted and that he lost his traditional language and culture approximately 50 years ago, when he was attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School near Lebret, Saskatchewan (the 'Residential School'). The Attorney General acknowledges that Sister Elle was employed at the school from 1944 until her death in 1993. HELD: 1) The limitation period in the POPA is set aside by s. 3(3.2) of the LAA for actions which fall within the scope of s.3(3(1)(d)(i) and 3(1(1) of that Act.  2) The plaintiff's claim of negligence is subject to the two year time limitation period under s.4 of the Liability and Proceedings Act. 3) The three year limitation period is calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability.  3) A claim of negligent is subject only to s. 2(1), of the Act and the LPA. The two year limitation time is calculated using the principles discoverability principle. 4) The claim of breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duty is not subject to this limitation period because the plaintiffs purport to bring this action against the Crown pursuant to the Crown Liability & Proceedings Act and against the other defendants as Crown agents. The 12 month time limitation time applies whether or not the person's right to bring the action was at any time governed by a limitation period pursuant to s3(2)(d) of this Act or any other Act. 5) The 12 months time limitation in the LAE applies even if the defendant has been properly vested in the Exchequer Court or the Federal Court Act. Time begins to run under s2(1/a) of The Crown Liable and Proceedings Authority only when the alleged injury or damage ceases. There is no agreement as to when that alleged injury/damage ceased. That is a factual matter to be dealt with at trial. 6) The twelve month limitation period (LAA) applies in priority to the more general provisions of the POPAA. The same argument was rejected in [R.J.G.] v. Attorney General of Canada (POPA)."
c_1996canlii6986.txt,"A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division. The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'. The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500. At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach. The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law. None were found in either case. The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.  2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format. The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case. 3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified. Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct. The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee. They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act. If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case. In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220. The concluding paragraph was amended to read: Subject to what has been stated in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the respondent will be entitled to recover its costs of, and incidental to this appeal, from the appellant, to be taxed on Column 3.","An appeal of a decision of the LEAGUE of Educational Directors and Superintendents (EDDs) which found the appellant guilty of professional misconduct. The Discipline Committee found the defendant guilty of misrepresenting the school improvement process report, which was critical of his leadership. The discipline committee recommended that the defendant be transferred. The defendant received a reprimand (to be placed on his file for a period of 5 years) and a fine of $2,500. Both parties submitted briefs of law in support of their positions. The Committee found that the evidence did not support the defendant's allegations of professional conduct, and that his use of candid discussions with the principal of the school to try and influence the decision of its committee constituted unprofessional conduct. It found that defendant intentionally caused the principal to believe that the report was critical, that it could be found to be untrue, and threatened the principal with termination of his contract if he did not apply for transfer. The Defendant was found guilty of threatening the principal and threatening to fire him if he refused to submit to a transfer request. The evidence was found to support the Defendant's allegations. The fine was imposed by the Defendant for $2k,000. Both the parties' versions of the same charge were found to have been substantially different in that the Defendant had misrepresented the report, made no reference to the principal, and acted in a way that was contrary to the evidence."

The 32 year old appellant had 32 previous convictions including two armed robberies and seven convictions relating to possession of weapons. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed and the sentence for each offence was increased to three years imprisonment to be served concurrently. 1)The judge made an error in calculating the time on remand that should have been credited to the sentence. Only six months rather than the whole year should have been counted. 2)Given the appellant's record these offences demanded more than the three year minimum generally imposed.","This was a Crown appeal against two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently. The sentences were imposed in respect of two convictions for armed robbery. The respondent agreed that the facts of the case were accurately set out in the Crown factum. He negotiated a sale of hash oil with the complainant, who agreed that it was sufficient. The confrontation was violent and the complainant grabbed a knife and threatened the respondent. The Respondent grabbed the money and the two men were separated. The appellant was arrested on the charge of armed robbery and was held on Remand until the date of sentencing. In the proceedings before the trial court it was considered that he had been on Remanded the entire time being 1 year. The trial judge felt that a sentence of four years imprisonment for the one year he believed the Respondent had spent on Remond should be appropriate. He gave credit of two year for the 1 year he thought he had spent in the States, and 2 years less 1 day concurrent on each charge. Some additional facts were not reproduced because they are not relevant to the appeal. The applicant is 32 years old and has 32 previous convictions including two armed robberies and seven other convictions relating to possession of weapons. He was on parole for his conviction of January 1992 for robbery and his parole was revoked in 1995. He had been put on Remandan the entire length of time being one year. He should have been given credit for the time he had already recuperated in the Indian Territory rather than being given a sentence for armed robberies."
c_2012nssc46.txt,"The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered. As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates. The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays. While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot. The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion. The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief. The motion was heard over approximately one-half day. Motion granted. The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs. The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process. It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike. The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to. Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response. Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism.","The defendant filed a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to its witnesses. The motion was allowed and the order granted included a direction as to the manner of discovery. The defendant argued that the issuance of the discovery subpoena was an improper use of discovery subpoenae and that the plaintiff should have made a motion excluding the defendant's representative from the discovery hearing. The Defendant argued that it was seeking a review of the subpoena process and that it had been abused in that it sought to exclude the plaintiff's representative. The parties agreed to the discovery schedule and the sequence of witnesses. In the middle of the parties attempting to make arrangements for discovery, the defendant’s representative was contacted by the plaintiff’d counsel. The plaintiff requested that the discovery subpoena be issued on the defendant representatives’ request as that was not the proper venue for discovery. In its motion to strike the subpoenas, the Defendant argued the discovery process was fundamentally flawed and that there was no evidence presented which warranted special consideration as to credibility issues as compared to other cases or situations. Further, the plaintiff argued that there were “minor issues” to be considered in determining the order in which the witnesses would be discovered, which was problematic given the defendant had made several attempts to circumvent the discovery order by asking the plaintiff to provide the representative of the defendant to the plaintiff. The issue was whether the defendant should have given the plaintiff a choice between discovery and party/party costs. The plaintiffs’ motion to exclude their representative was allowed because they thought the subpoena would be improper in that the plaintiffs had made no effort to contact the representative during negotiations to reach an agreement on discovery. Further plaintiff”s motion to have the representative excluded from the examination of the witnesses was also allowed because the plaintiff had made a mistake in arranging for discovery and because the representative had not yet been discovered. The decision to not grant costs was also not in dispute. The court reviewed the various factors in increasing costs and determined that the defendant was entitled to costs on a solicitor/client basis. The costs range was from $500 to $1,000. The order of the solicitor/party cost was set aside and the amount of costs awarded was reduced by $500 as the plaintiff did not intend to abuse the discovery procedure in this case and the decision to award costs was made in the context of the litigation."
4_2016skqb136.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage. They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012. The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.",The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the parenting of their four children since the separation. The petitioner had initially applied for interim orders dealing with the parenting and division of family property. The parties had previously held joint custody with the primary residence but the mother had since withdrawn her application for an order changing the interim parenting time to alternating weekends and weekday overnights. The father had since then been living with the mother and had not brought a formal application to change the interim order made. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the application was not an attempt to change an interim parenting arrangement made by the parties and was not intended to fetter a different conclusion based on evidence that may be available at trial. The children had primarily resided with the father and had primarily been residing with him. The Court found that it would not grant an order of the kind sought by the mother because the current arrangements did not represent the current status of the children and were not intended or reasonable to the Court's understanding of the circumstances. The only reference to the parenting arrangement in the application could be that of the parties' current agreement. The parents had made little effort to establish that the current arrangement represented the current situation and the children were not at risk in the meantime.

Dismissing the appeal, that the police officers were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion when they detained the appellant, and had a reasonable basis for stopping his vehicle. The appellant's contention he consumed only two small bottles (1-1/2 ounces each) of rum, plus some cough syrup and mints, did not constitute evidence to the contrary to rebut the presumption of the breathalyzer offence. On Appeal.","The accused was arrested for impaired driving and given a breathalyser demand. The police officer then radioed two other police officers to stop the vehicle and gave them the usual two breathalysers. The accused refused to take the tests and was convicted on a charge of impaired driving. The Crown appealed the conviction, arguing that the officer had erred in law by failing to give effect to the opinion of the crown expert that the amount consumed by the accused would not have given readings which appeared on the certificate. Dismissing the appeal, that the police officers did not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion and had advanced a reasonable basis and had an articulable cause for stopping the vehicle. They had not been acting arbitrarily."
b_1999skqb167.txt,"An appeal of a conviction for having the care or control of a motor vehicle after consuming in excess of 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. Although the trial judge concluded the appellant rebutted the presumption in s.258(1)(where it is proven that an accused occupies the seat normally occupied by the operator of the vehicle, it is presumed he is in care and control unless he can establish that he did not occupy the seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion), the appellant was found to be in de facto control. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was clear from the trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the two paramedics who had noted the car parked in an unusual place and police officer who came along later, that he rejected the theory advanced by the appellant's counsel. The location of the ignition key was not relevant. The appellant's memory of the events was far from clear given the level of his intoxication. The trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on the evidence of the Crown witnesses.","The accused was convicted of operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over.08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code and of driving with a.08 blood alcohol level greater than.08. The issue before the trial judge was whether the accused was caught by the presumption of care and control of his vehicle pursuant to s258(1). The accused advanced a spirited argument that the evidence outlined by the learned judge did not justify the conclusion that the Crown had established proof of 'care and control' beyond a reasonable doubt. He attacked the evidence of the ambulance attendants and police officer over the accused's version of what took place. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge properly dealt with the next question, namely, had the Crown on the evidence established by credible evidence beyond a reasonably reasonable doubt that the appellant (notwithstanding that he rebutted the presumption) was nevertheless in de facto control of the vehicle. He was perfectly entitled to do so. The location of the ignition key was not relevant, given the fact it was located somewhere on the right side of the steering wheel. The accused had much different story. He thought the vehicle was running when he woke up but the learned trial judge clearly accepted the evidence that the two ambulance attendants (who were on scene when the accused entered the vehicle) had put it into first gear and released the clutch; as result, the attendants were mistaken about his wanting to start the vehicle and he was subsequently found behind the wheel of the car."
c_2009skca53.txt,"The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts. They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences. The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature. The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders. The Court found the sentences must be set aside. The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment. HELD: The total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served.","The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition; conspiring together and with others to traffick in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of The Controlled Drugs & Substances act; and trafficking in marijuana contrary to ss. 5 (1) and 5(2) of Controlled Drugsand Substances. The Crown appealed the sentences. HELD: The sentences were set aside. 1) The sentences are not demonstrably unfit in light of the seriousness of the offences, even after taking into account the mitigating factors of the offenders. 2) The respondents have been employed in several jobs and have already served 5 months of the conditional sentence imposed by the sentencing judge for which they should be given credit. The total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served. 3) The total sentences imposed in these cases must be set aside (i.e., 18 months concurrent for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment."
d_1995canlii5746.txt,"When Davidson, Sr. sold his farm to his son he retained the right to continue receiving the rentals arising from four surface leases which he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells. The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases. There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title. HELD: Declaration denied. Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs. 1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.  2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him. His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego. This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years.","The plaintiff was granted an option to purchase land from the defendants. The option was exercised and a fee simple title was issued to him. The title was encumbered by, inter alia, caveats protecting the surface leases but there was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The land fell into the family of which the plaintiff was son, one who needed to expand his farming operation. The action was dismissed with costs. HELD: The action is dismissed with cost. 1)It is repugnant that the court be called upon tovest in an interest which has heretofore been freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 2)The plaintiff has been at the risk of being sued by the defendants because of the indefeasibility provisions of the Land Title Act when they come into conflict with equitable rights. When the plaintiff's option to buy land was exercised he was denied the right to continue receiving rentals. 3)The option was discontinued because the title was not encumbered with caveats protecting surface leases. 4)The land had been previously owned by the defendant and he had not been aware of the reservations during the transfer. 5)The defendant had not received an equitable declaration under the Act. He therefore had no option to sue."
d_1995canlii3966.txt,The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of assaulting his 8 year old stepdaughter by slapping her and striking her with a small paddle. The Crown and counsel for the accused agreed that a fine and probation would be appropriate. The trial judge sentenced him to 1 year in prison and 1 year's probation. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The force applied was minimal and the child was not injured physically. 2)The sentence imposed would result in the accused losing his employment which would harm his dependents. 3)The Court reduced his sentence to 60 days intermittent.,The appellant plead guilty to the charge of assaulting an eight year stepdaughter. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment and one year's probation. The Crown and the defence agreed that it was probably an instance where a fine and probation order would create the necessary special deterrence and parental guidance the situation called for. The trial judge was however of the view that the conduct of the accused warranted a more severe penalty. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a sentence of 60 days intermittent was substituted for the sentence of 1 year. The probation order was to remain unchanged except to substitute the word 'approved' for'supervised' in the first condition.
6_1997canlii9876.txt,"The respondent was hired as an account manager by the appellant. She did not reach her planned sales goals during her employment, and became depressed. She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor. When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job. She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed. The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress. The appellant appealed the award for mental distress. Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal, that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice. Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment. However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises.","The appellant corporation appealed a jury award of $60,000 for mental distress. The appellant had been hired as account manager with a sales territory consisting of the four Atlantic provinces. The job description for the account manager called for a four percent commission on software licenses and the net margin on hardware sales plus a scheme of cash bonuses for exceeding revenue targets which were not stated in the contract. The sales compensation plan provided for a 4 percent commission rate on software licences and the gross margin on new hardware accounts and two per cent on existing hardware accounts. The contract was to be made public within ninety days of the dismissal. The employee had been given six months' notice. The trial judge awarded the money for mental anguish and punitive damages, plus $20,000 in punitive damages. The jury found that mental suffering would not have been in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was entered into as flowing from the appellant's unjust dismissal. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The established law in contract law provides the proper test for the recovery of damages for mental suffering. The principles of contract law provide the proper tests for the proper testing of damages. 2)The jury was properly instructed in its assignment of the duties of the sales manager to the salesperson and accordingly appropriately directed to the person who provided the proper notice. 3)The conduct of the Salesperson prior to her dismissal was high handed and callous. It was not appropriate to award the job to someone who had already suffered from severe depression and anxiety. 4)The salesperson was awarded six months notice. 5)The court found that the mental suffering suffered by the appellant was inordinately and disproportionately high."
e_1999skqb268.txt,"The defendant manufactured solarium in Saskatoon which it sold to the plaintiffs in Minnesota. The plaintiffs alleged the solarium was defective, sued and obtained judgment in the Minnesota Court which it now sought to enforce in Saskatchewan. The defendant argued the Minnesota court did not have jurisdiction because at the time the action was commenced he was not 'ordinarily resident' in the state of Minnesota. The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act. 2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there. The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address. It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state. The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'.","The plaintiffs sought to enforce payment by the defendant of judgment for $23,396.03 in US currency awarded to them by the defendants in the First Judicial District of Minnesota. The action was defended on the basis that the defendant was not ordinarily resident in the state of Minnesota and did not appear before the Minnesota court or submit to its jurisdiction. HELD: The action had been dismissed with costs to be taxed.  1)The court in Minnesota did not have jurisdiction over the defendant because at the time the action was commenced the defendant had made use of United States postal facilities and had to comply with postal regulations which required an address in the United States. In order to comply the defendant arranged for an address at 701-4th Avenue South in the City of Minneapolis. An address of this nature could be understood as connoting either residential or business address. The logical conclusion, so it seems to me, is that it is a business address in Minnesota. 2)Because the defendant is not ordinarilyresident in Minnesota when the action is commenced the second factor, the time question raised in subsection 3(a) needs no further explication. 3)The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the plaintiff's claim but did not appeared and defend the action or in any way submit to the jurisdiction of the Minnesota Court."
4_2000canlii3136.txt,"In a trial of liability only, jury found defendants to be entirely responsible for causing motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff. Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages. Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied. Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount. The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced. There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment. Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition. In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered. Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application. The evidence in support of the spouse's application was far too incomplete and had yet to be tested by defendants in discovery. Court could not form opinion on what damages spouse was likely to recover.","The plaintiff was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident in 1994, when he was injured in an automobile accident. He brought an action for the recovery of damages from his employer, Schneider National Carriers. The issue of liability was severed when a civil jury trial was held in 2000. The plaintiff sought an interim payment of $250,000, which Schneider offered to the plaintiff. The defendant argued that it would be a just amount, given the nature of the injuries, their lengthy employment record and the plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt. Awarding the plaintiff $15,000 for past loss of income, that the present loss of potential earning capacity is far from complete at this stage and that is yet to be tested by the defendants in further pre-hearing procedures. What is known is the Gmeiner actuarial report, which quantifies the past loss in earnings at approximately $216,000 using a valuation date of June 1, 2000. This head of damage has a much higher degree of certainty of recovery, subject to any arguments of mitigation which the defendants might develop."
2003skqb248.txt,"An appeal from conviction and sentence for theft of an electricity generator valued at under $5,000 contrary to Criminal Code s.334(b). On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction. The appellant pled not guilty. Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction. Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began. Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.  1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2). 2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods. The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft. Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly. There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.  3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge. However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines. If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.",HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was set aside. The Provincial Court judge did not err in determining that the Crown could proceed on indictment or by summary conviction. The substantive distinction in the proceedings was limited to the range of sentencing upon conviction. On appeal the question of jurisdiction was asked if the Crown had misconstrued or misapplied the doctrine of recent possession and whether the appellant had given adequate reasons for convicting himself. The appellant argued that the trial judge misinterpreted the doctrine and should have proceeded by indictment. The respondent argued that he had been advised of the Crown's intention to proceed by summary. The trial judge's decision did not provide adequate reasons and the appellant contended that the conviction was not supported by the evidence and could not be supported without application of the doctrineof recent possession. The appeal from conviction was allowed on the grounds that the respondent had not provided adequate reasons to convict. The sentence was set off and the appeal returned to Provincial Court.

They were not habitually resident in Saskatchewan and had been here only 3 months. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. The uncontradicted evidence that the mother never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home was accepted.

It is likely that his teacher, playmates, schoolmates, aunts, uncles and others, including the paternal grandmother, may be called to testify about facts and circumstances bearing on the children's best interests. 3)The father had delayed in bringing an application for custody in British Colombia because of his mistaken belief that the petitioner was considering reconciliation, although he learned when he received her affidavit in support of her custody application, that she never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home.

The respondent had purchased the property in 1996 and used it for composting, the creation of topsoil and sand excavation. The appellants claimed the property was materially less than the size represented in the notice and plans to extract sand or otherwise develop the property were negatively affected. The defendants in the Supreme Court action also sought better details of general damage, including the quantum of the damages. The Chambers judge dismissed the appellants' application for additional particulars, dismissing the application for the general damages claim. It was the respondent's position that particulars of damages need only be pleaded where the demand is liquidated. An expectation claim which depends upon variable factors (here, factors such as the state of the economy, the price of sand, the cost of excavation) need not be particularized in the pleadings. The Court was not persuaded that the absence of particulars sought by the appellant compromise their ability to file a defence."

The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health. It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem. The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000. The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment. Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs. Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages.","The respondent admitted liability for his truck into the back of his vehicle. The trial judge described the accident as a very mild rear end collision. She determined that the accident did not contribute materially to the appellant's present poor health, and that the automobile accident caused only a mild aggravation of his pre-existing, and major, back problem. The appellant cross appeals claiming that the trial judge's award of $25,000 as general damages is excessive and should be reduced. The appeal and cross appeal both dismissed without costs as per the reasons for the decision. The Appeal and Cross appeal both fell short of the goal of establishing that the appeal and/or cross appeal were in excess of what the appellant ultimately received. The issue on appeal was whether the trial court's assessment of general damages was so inordinately high as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of damages. HELD: The appeal was both dismissed and the cross appeal was dismissed. There was ample medical evidence to support the trial's conclusion that the incident did not have a material effect to the respondent's present health. No such reasons were advanced by the appellant in this case. The Court will not interfere with the assessment of damages in such a case as to interfere with it's accuracy."

The former registered representative of TFPG was terminated for selling unapproved investments in breach of a Shareholder Advisor Agreement which permitted the sale of TFPG's financial products and services only. TFPG sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the respondent to return all materials and files respecting TFPG's clients, to cease any contact with its clients, and to make no attempt to solicit any current or prospective client. HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG. The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services. 1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.  2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration. It was not unconscionable nor against public policy. The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement. The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor. The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm.","FIAT. The plaintiff sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the defendant to deliver all files, documents, records, plans, software or other TFPG related material respecting clients of the plaintiff. The defendant had entered into a Shareholder Advisor Agreement with the plaintiff in exchange for this agreement which the plaintiff received commissions from. It is alleged the respondent sold unapproved investments of a competitor and as result he was terminated pursuant to the agreement. As well, the applicant claims the respondent continues to breach the non-solicitation clause by carrying on the same business on his own. That part of the order may issue. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the right to an interlocutory injunction was clear and was too restrictive. It was not clear if the relief sought in paragraph (iii) of the draft order should issue with the right of the respondent to make and keep copies of the documents turned over to the applicant. It would be a violation of the contractual right to consult with and for independent counsel on the issues. The provision for an injunction is important in its influence upon an exercise of the discretionary power of the court to grant a temporary injunction. In this case the applicant was required to satisfy the court that the application should be denied, that the respondent continued to refuse to turn over its property and client files, that he has and continues to conduct the samebusiness on his Own and that the applicant continues to solicit his clients. The applicant was also required to make copies of his documents to the respondent."
b_2011nssc75.txt,"After a piece of family property was divided into two parcels, one of the brothers continued to use a driveway and maintain a garden on the other parcel. When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times. When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription. He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission. Judgment for the defendants; there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway. Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission.","Roy Longard, the plaintiff, wanted to continue to garden on the Keel property and use the Borden driveway. He claimed that he had the right to do both. The evidence on the basis of the Statutory Declaration and the totality of the evidence was that the brothers had communicated to each other frequently and that they both knew that the access right-of-way that ran through their home was the Bordens driveway. This use continued uninterrupted after the brothers received the portion of their property and as long as the church remained on his property they continued to sell the property. Roy Longard's use of the Bordene driveway was not in dispute. The plaintiffs' argument that the defendant's actions had led them to use the driveway was rejected. Roy argued that he has the right both ways. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The court found that the defendants had not shown that the reservation contained in the 1942 deed to the extent that it incorporated the Bordenes driveway. There was no expressed reservation shown by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had not proven that the Bordeners' right to access the property had been lost. The defendant had not demonstrated that the plaintiff's application for a writ of mandamus was dismissed as frivolous. The Court found that it was not necessary to resolve the issue of costs. As long as Roy Longards' use of this driveway was successful and the plaintiffs were able to obtain a right to continue using it, the court found the defendant had the property in a legally justified manner."
7_2014skpc84.txt,"Criminal Law – Strict LiabilityStatutes – Interpretation – Traffic Safety Act, Section 203(1)Traffic Safety Act – Motor Vehicle Offences – Passing Highway Workers or Equipment The accused was charged with an offence contrary to s. 203(1) of The Traffic Safety Act, driving over 60 km/h passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone. The accused was charged as the owner of the vehicle, not necessarily the driver. The offence was the result of a speed monitoring camera and the Act allows the Crown to complete their case without calling any witnesses. The accused testified that he did not speed past any highway workers or equipment. He said that he was following a pilot vehicle when he passed the workers and equipment and only sped up after the pilot vehicle turned around when there were no more workers or equipment. The picture of the accused’s vehicle from the speed monitoring camera did not show any highway workers or equipment. HELD: The person who tested and deployed the speed monitoring camera provided affidavit evidence that the picture was taken within a marked construction area but it did not say that the accused was speeding as he was passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment. Section 203(1) specifies that there is only an offence for travelling at a speed greater than 60 km/h when passing highway workers or operating equipment. The accused was found not guilty.",The accused was charged with driving faster than 60 km per hour when passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone. The offence under s. 203(1) of the Traffice Safety Act is a strict liability offence and its documentary evidence proves every element of the offence. The only aspect of the Crown's case that the accused disputes is that he passed highway workers and occupied highway Equipment when he was travelling faster than60 kilometres per hour. The accused was the only witness for the defence. He testified that he did not speed past any highway workers nor occupied highway machinery in the work zone and claimed that the speed monitoring camera must have photographed his vehicle. The Crown found the accused not guilty. The court found the offence under ss. 203 and the Traffices Safety Act a strict and unequivocal liability offence. HELD: The accused is found not guilty of driving faster then 60 km/hr when passing or occupied by highway equipment in a workzone. The offences under s 203(2) of The Traffice safety Act is strict liability. The documentary evidence proved every element. The exception is when the accused passed highway work or occupied road equipment when he is travelling faster then 30 km/hour. The case law allows the accused to ask for an order requiring the defence to attend for cross-examination but he did so.
d_2003nssc223.txt,"The testator had prepared his own Will on a pre-printed form and left his assets to his children, whom he then proceeded to name. One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will. the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it. The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception. In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will.","The testator left behind a will (which he succeeded to succeed his sister) which identified his children as his sole beneficiaries. The result was that the testator's children would have the final say on who the children would share in the estate. The testator intended to make the gift personae designatae rather than a class gift. The children would be entitled to their share in his Will as well as the antiques and jewellery he had given to his wife. The court found that the gift of a grandchild, which was to be given to each of the children by his will, had a commonality with the children and would not have been a class gifts to them except for the fact that the grandmother had predeceased the testor. The gift of property to each child was not class gift, as it was not properly executed and witnessed."

The plaintiff locked his brakes and skidded into the defendant, attempting to avoid an accident. Damage to both vehicles exceeded the insurance deductibles and both parties claim damages against each other for the amount of the deductibles. HELD: The plaintiff will have judgment against the defendant in the amount of $50. The defendant will have judgment against the plaintiff in the amount of $450 plus costs. Fault for this accident was attributed 10% to the defendant and 90% to the plaintiff. The defendant had indeed yielded properly but could have been more prudent in insuring that other motorist were aware that she yielded.

The plaintiff's truck entered a skid at a stop sign located approximately two feet from the driving portion of the highway and struck the side of the plaintiff's vehicle. The intersection was unusual in that the stop sign is 39 feet back from the edge of the pavement, which itself is approximately two inches from the driver's right of way. Henry complied with the requirement to stop at the stop and then proceed toward the actual intersection. However, the plaintiff brought this action against the car's owner, Vernon Henry, and Margaret Henry for his insurance deductible and the defendant for the counterclaim.

b_2007skqb1.txt,"This is an appeal pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act, 1997. The appellant asserts a palpable and overriding error by the learned trial judge in accepting, and finding as fact, part of the testimony of a witness but not accepting the further testimony of the witness that an amount was also owing to the appellant by the respondent. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The trial judge was not required to accept the entirety of the witness's testimony, despite having accepted most of it, particularly in light of the contradictory evidence of the respondent denying the sum claimed by the appellant. The denial by the respondent of the appellant's claim, accepted by the trial judge, was fatal to the appellant's onus of proving a mutual understanding and absolute acknowledgement of the alleged debt between the parties.","The appellant asserted a palpable and overriding error by the trial judge in accepting as fact part of the testimony of the respondent who accepted the amount as being the correct quantum of his counterclaim and for which judgment was given to the respondent for $1,685.86. The trial judge found that the appellant admitted owing $1k685.85 to the the respondent, who accepted that amount as the correct amount of his Counterclaim and judgment was then given to him for that amount. The appellant also argued that there was no error of law or unreasonable finding of fact by the judge, and that his conclusions were not so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There was no order as to costs. 1)There was no palpable and overarching error by either party. The juridical and overriding principle of law and case authorities were not before the trial court nor argued on this appeal. The law and law authorities were neither before the court nor the respondent nor raised on this record.  2)There had been sufficient evidence to establish a mutual understanding of the law and the principles of law applicable to all witnesses. The conviction of the appellant for loaning the respondent $1 million for the purpose of funding repairs to the vehicle was accepted by the appellant. The Juridical Juridic Juridicus, who concluded that the trial juridicus had met sufficient assistance in determining the absolute sum of the debt was the correct sum, was not preferred to the trial's rejection of the witness's evidence on the basis of contradictory evidence and insufficient evidence."

The defendant's bank loans fell into default after SGI disability benefits were terminated. The Bank reported the particulars of the loan defaults to a credit reporting agency (Equifax). The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans. The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement. The bank commenced this action for payment. The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract. HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims. The bank's claim was admitted at trial. 1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement. The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate. Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case. 3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business.","The plaintiff banked with the Royal Bank and at the time of the accident the Compain's were indebted to the Royal bank under a credit line and Visa credit card account. The Royal Bank agreed to defer commencement of any action with respect to the defaulted Bank Loans until such time as the Compains received an accident injury settlement from SGI. The Bank refused to pay the loans and the Compaine's counter-claimed against the Royal for general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages. The plaintiff Royal Bank defended and counter-attacked against the Bank of Canada for breach of its duty, duty, or duty of confidentiality and by amendment application made at trial and allowed by this judgment, breach of contract. HELD: The claim against the bank was dismissed in total. 1)Nothing of the counter-claimant's claims were upheld and they were dismissed in the total. The defendant Royal Bank will have its costs against the defendant (plaintiff by counter-suit) taxed. 2)The plaintiff Royal bank expressly waived any contractual rights which he impliedly had to confidentiality of his credit information. By the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement he authorized the RoyalBank to release to Equifax the information which it did. 3)None of the bankrupt's counterclaims were dismissed. 4)None were upheld in total in the alternative. The Compain had been awarded costs against both the Royal and Bank ofCanada for general and exemplary damages."
2_2011skpc5.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over. 08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop. The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time. The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar. The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up. The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle. The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count. The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date. The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability. The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward. The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door. The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.",The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.08. The defence had admitted all of the essential elements of each charge; the only issue was whether or not the accused was the person operating the vehicle. HELD: The defence evidence lacked reliability. The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The Court found as a fact that the keys were in the ignition when the police arrived at the vehicle and had been in the vehicle since the time the group entered the vehicle; the Court found that the accused had been drinking and that she had clearly indicated to the officers that the vehicle was running. The court found that it was a fact the accused's keys were on the ignition device when the officers first observed the vehicle being started. The fact that she was behind the wheel and the vehicle had been pulled back in does not help the defence. The evidence of the police officers was not reliable. The officer was adamant and unshaken on the main points of the evidence. The time lines were considerably different from time lines given by the accused. The Defence officer was found to be somewhat evasive in cross-examination. The difference between the demeanour he exhibited during his testimony and that of the accused in examination-in-chief and cross- examination did not end the matter.
b_2006skqb218.txt,"The respondent applies to vary the consent joint custody order granted in October 2004. His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson. The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson. HELD: 1) The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent. This also requires a change in access arrangements. These are changes in circumstances that are material.  2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson. The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey. After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child. Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis. Even telephone access has been sporadic. Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3) The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation. The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support. 4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson. It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to. The petitioner has always been Tyson's primary caregiver. The petitioner is the psychological parent.","The parties separated in May 2004. The respondent moved from the Kindersley district to the Archerwill district, displacing one of the couple's two children from the northwest Saskatchewan to northeastern Saskatchewan. The applicant applied to vary the consent order granted in October 2004. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The sole issue on this variation application is determining the primary residence of Tyson. That entails deciding what is in his best interests. 2)The parties had already made an agreement that the move would not have any material impact on the children. 3)The move was not a long-term solution to all problems. There would be disruption to the children's ability to deal with one another and for the court to have a hearing to determine what is best interests of the child. 4)The decision to move Tyson would not be in the best interests for the children if it was made at the first opportunity. The child would be separated from his psychological parent. The psychological parent would be the person to whom the child would most be bonded. The disruption to his ability to communicate with his biological parent would most likely be minimal."

At issue was whether the screening measures taken ensured that no disclosure would occur and satisfied the evidentiary burden imposed on the law firm. HELD: The solicitor and the law firm were disqualified from acting for the petitioner in the action. Because two years had lapsed further examinations were appropriate and an order issued for the petitioner to attend a further examination. If the updated information is not necessary for trial the petitioner may request costs at that time.

Gray the Law Society amended the code of conduct to provide for rules where a member transfers from one law firm to another. 2)The difficulty in this case was that no measures were taken prior to or at the time the solicitor joined the firm to ensure confidentiality. The time period before taking appropriate steps was completely inadequate.  3)The second question, whether there was a risk that the confidential information will be used to the prejudice of the client, Martin v.

Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit. The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties. There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay. The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced. In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials. In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided. The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky. On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act. Husky was the user or consumer of the cement. The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well. Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts. Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property. Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law.

The claim against the third parties was considered a third party claim. The court found that the parties had all complied with s.55(4) of the Revenue and Finance Act, and that the claim for the refund of PST was not a third-party claim. As the plaintiff was the final user and consumer of the materials provided pursuant to the contracts between the thirdparty contractors and the plaintiff, the tax on the cement was barred because the plaintiff wasn't entitled to refund of it.

HELD: 1)Section 258(7) has been judicially amended to mean 'true copy' which presumably, though not logically, means something more than 'copy'. It has grown to the point that an affidavit may be disregarded if the police do not provide supplemental evidence when challenged as to the manner in which they assured the accuracy of the copy. 2)The trial judge further advanced the law to a point where, even when not challenged, there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit.

The appellant has failed to persuade us that Mr. Justice Koch erred in any material respect. In other words, we see no tenable basis for interfering with his decision. [2] The debtor clearly committed an act of bankruptcy under ss. 42(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, as a result of the sheriff's return of nulla bona to the respondent's writ of execution against the debtor. [3] That left Justice Koch to consider whether to dismiss the petition pursuant to ss. 43(7) of the Act or to stay proceedings on the petition pursuant to ss. 43(11). [4] As for the first, the debtor did not satisfy Justice Koch that he was able to pay his debts or that there existed other sufficient cause to dismiss the petition. Based on the evidence adduced by the debtor, we are of the view there is no basis to conclude that Mr. Justice Koch should have been satisfied of these matters. [5] As for second, concerning ss. 43(11), we note that the subsection contains discretionary power to stay proceedings. That, of course, serves to narrow the basis for intervention on appeal. We cannot say Justice Koch erred in any requisite respect in the exercise of this discretionary power. [6] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, with costs on appeal to the respondent to be taxed in the usual way.","The appellant failed to persuade the court that the appellant erred in any material respect or that there was no tenable basis for interfering with his decision. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The appellant had failed to convince the court whether to dismiss the petition pursuant to s. 43(7) of the Act or to stay proceedings on the petition under s.43(11). The first, the debtor did not satisfy the court's court that he was able to pay his debts or that There existed other sufficient cause to dismiss. Based on the evidence adduced by the debtor, there was nothing to conclude that the court should have been satisfied of these matters. As for the second, the creditor did not constitute the defendant's sufficient cause or that he had other sufficient grounds to dismissthe petition. Based, we are of the view there is no basis to conclude the court was satisfied of the matters."
3_1999canlii12358.txt,"Two female employees filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination contrary to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. The unionized employer applied for judicial review in the nature of prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s.25 of the Trade Union with the result that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship and granted an order prohibiting the Board of Inquiry from hearing and determining the matter. Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount. HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment. 2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect. 3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account. It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.  4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff. No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25] This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator. The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction. The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement. To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.","An action under the Trade Union Act or the collective agreement to resolve a dispute involves an individual exercising his or her right to a fair and equitable hearing under the terms of the collective agreements. The dispute was also brought by a union member, who alleged that the employer had discriminated against him on the basis of his sex. The Board of Inquiry was set aside and the matter remitted to the Board of inquiry established under the Act in accordance with the provisions under the act. The parties agreed to a collective agreement agreement that prohibits discrimination against employees on the grounds of sex. In this agreement, the employer agreed to arbitration. The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code in that it dealt specifically with the employment relationship of the employees. He therefore determined that the dispute could not be resolved by arbitration, which would deny the complainants the right to seek redress. The respondent was awarded costs of the action."
e_2005skqb51.txt,"The plaintiff seeks damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp. He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning. The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount. It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements. 1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge. The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty. The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. 4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention. The plaintiff experienced headaches for several weeks. He also had stiff neck and sleep disturbance. There were no long term effects. Corrigendum received January 25, 2005 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff sought damages for unlawful arrest and assault arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received a cut to his scalp just inside the hairline above his left eye. The action of the police officers was in dispute as to whether the plaintiff's actions amounted to obstruction or unlawful arrest. HELD: 1)Credibility was assessed at $7,500 plus costs. The officer responsible for the arrest and charge of obstruct was solely involved in arresting the plaintiff. The actions of the other defendants were in dispute. 2)The plaintiff did not require transportation to hospital but asked the officer if he wished to go to the hospital and was advised to go ahead and call the police. The police officer was not aware of the plaintiff’s prior actions and did not intervene. The plaintiff did have a valid employment contract with the police and was not subject to any of the reasonable force provisions of the Criminal Code. 3)The officer was properly supervising the plaintiff throughout the arrest process. The issues were whether the defendant’d been assaulted and whether it was necessary to arrest the plaintiff bearing in mind the provisions of s. 495(2) of the Code. The events outside of the lounge were not largely in dispute and vary in minor detail only. The activities of the individual outside of lounge were in question. The decisions of the officer were in issue. The defendant was properly supervised throughout the trial. The court found that the defendant was not seeking personal or financial gain and the plaintiff was entitled to the benefit of the agreement negotiated with the officer. The parties also found that, in respect to the plaintiff outside of his lounge, the defendant had not indicated that he wished or consent to the arrest of the victim. The decision to arrest plaintiff was therefore squarely within the defendant and did result in the plaintiff having no personal or monetary gain."
c_2004nssc248.txt,"In a divorce proceeding, the wife claimed lump sum spousal support in the amount of $20,000 to allow her to return to her native country. She also claimed that periodic maintenance was not appropriate because of the difficulty of enforcement when she is living abroad and referenced two occasions when the husband was paying periodic support that she had to seek the assistance of Maintenance Enforcement. The husband opposed paying any more spousal support but expressed a preference for lump sum support if he was required to pay more, as it would allow him to move on with his life with his new family. Husband ordered to pay a lump sum award of $10,000 to wife; when the parties moved to Nova Scotia, the husband was able to improve his financial situation, while the wife's position deteriorated.","The parties were married in 1996 and had previously been married in Sweden, but had divorced in 1993. There were no children of the relationship and the only contested issue was the respondent's claim for lump sum spousal support. The parties agreed all property had been divided to their mutual satisfaction and an outstanding debt of approximately 34,000 krona was their joint responsibility. The respondent had recently relocated to Nova Scotia from Sweden, and the court was satisfied that, because of the parties' previous relationship and economic difficulties, there was a need for a large lump sum to ease the transition to self-sufficiency. The petitioner was able to purchase an air ticket to travel to Sweden and to finance her living expenses for eight months, and she was not challenged by the respondent. The applicant was awarded lump sum payment of $10,000. The court found that, in addition to the two years of spousals received, the respondent was entitled to purchase some air tickets and to buy a dog to travel and to meet her living needs for eight month. The Court awarded lump sums to the respondent in addition of the two year spousa support of $5,000 and $10k to the applicant in the amount of $7,000, respectively."

Quashing three of the 11 committals, that the judge failed to follow the literal formality of s. 541(1) of the Criminal Code.

e_1998canlii13440.txt,"The applicants sought an order under s.11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-lease with either VIP Business Centre (VIP) or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd (SaskLtd). Bennett, owner of an office building (the Plaza), leased space to VIP for five years ending in 1997. Issues included (i)whether there had been a valid renewal of the head lease; (ii)whether there had been valid renewals of sub-leases; (iii)assuming valid renewals, did s4 of the Statute of Frauds bar enforcement against Bennett; (iv)whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear an application for relief under s11 brought solely by notice of motion; (v)are the applicants entitled to such relief; (vi)whether Bennett was bound by the sub-leases by virtue of taking the assignment from VIP. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application. Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits. 2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion. There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises. The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry. Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle. grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion. They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine. In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically. The applciants could obtain other office space including that offered by Bennett. General and punitive damages would provide an adequate remedy.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that a valid renewal of the head lease did not exist between the parties nor could valid renewals of sub-leases meet the requirements of s. 4 of the Statute of Fraud. The applicants were entitled to relief under s. 3 of the Act. The Court assumed the evidence led by the applicants was true. The only memoranda of the original head lease and its original sub-lease were from the applicants and were sent to the respondent. The respondent proceeded by notice of motion in circumstances where no 'action' existed. The application fell short of constituting part of the performance for purposes of s4 regardless of whether a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine is applied. The actions and performance of the applicants fell short if a valid renewal of subleases existed or if valid renewales of sub leases did not meet the requirement of s2 of the statute. The decision on issue s3 could not be made on an examination of the conflicting affidavits. The order on issue 4 could not provide complete justice as between the Parties. The issues were: 1) whether a valid renewedals of the sub-leasing and the head leases existed; 2) whether valid renewaling of subleasing and head leases met the requirements s4 of the statute of fraud. In the alternative, the applicants were not entitled to the relief claimed under s11 of the act. The relocation at no cost to the applicants or VIP was as consistent with an agreement to accommodate the needs of Bennett as with the agreements asserted by the parties. The relocations were common in commercial office buildings. The sole issue was whether the applicants had the means to obtain other office space, including other office spaces offered by the plaintiff. The plaintiff was awarded costs."
5_2009nspc10.txt,"The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation. Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana. When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse. He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him. After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment. The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs. Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon. The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search. He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied. The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached. While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary. Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning. After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case. Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable. The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana. The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge. Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful. The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable. In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","The accused was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and a charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The accused was in the backseat of a vehicle when the officer approached him. The officer smelled marijuana coming from the vehicle. The driver was asked to exit the vehicle and the accused was not seen leaving the vehicle; the officer smelled strong smell of marijuana coming out of the accused's person. The officers approached the accused and noted a strong smell. The police officer smelled a strong odor of marijuana. The arrest was found to be unlawful and the cannabis marijuana was excluded. The defence sought an order excluding the admission of the defence's statement to the police and exclusion of the results of the search of the person's person pursuant to s. 490(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused is found guilty of possession of marijuana for the purposes of trafficking and the charge of trafficking is dismissed. 1) The accused elected not to be arrested. The Court reviewed the factors and found that the accused had reasonable and probable grounds to be charged. 2) The Court accepted that the officer's stated reason for arrest was based upon reasonable and likely grounds rather than on an inference that the marijuana was present. The fact that the smell of burned marijuana was part of a larger supporting context supported the conclusion that the cannabis was probably present. There was no breach of the officer’s rights by the accused. The statement of defence was found not to have been voluntary. The court found that there was no violation of the offence of possession by the officer. The evidence was found that, in appropriate circumstances, the Court may accept as reasonable an inference the accused is in possession of marihuana."
9_1994canlii4283.txt,"The respondent had undertaken the residential development of certain lands bordering the appellant's property and constructed roadways which it proposed to convey to the Department of Transportation, who agreed to accept with the consent of owners of property where water would drain from the road. When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement. The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer. The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions. In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act. Allowing the appeal, that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost. However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch. Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems.","The applicant developer, Armoyan, applied to have proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act implemented. Armoyans had failed to agree to the terms of the agreement, and had refused to supply the ditch or drain to the applicant. Application dismissed; Armoyanos was entitled to continue the ditch to proper outlet and receive the necessary technical details of the ditch. The applicant failed to provide consent for the drainage, and so the applicant's right to proceed was terminated. The court found that Armoyano was entitled, pursuant to s.7(1) of the Act, to construct a ditch or drainage through the Haverstock estate. The land was to be used for the purposes of the drainage plan. If Armoyani was not entitled to construct the ditch, it was ordered to be delivered to the respondent."
b_2001skca85.txt,"The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease. In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959. The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993. After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner. The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V. The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench. 1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule. The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive. The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society. The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times. Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae. Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule. Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.  2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease. The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed. The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general. The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property. A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough. The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision. The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease. As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971. The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future. The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.","The trial judge held that the lease was void because it breached the rule against perpetuities and allowed the respondents' action for declaration to that effect. He allowed the counterclaim by the appellant against the respondent for breach of confidence with consequent directions for an accounting and assessment of damages. The principal question on this appeal is whether the appellants' oil and gas 'top lease' with the late Harry Herbert Taylor should be rendered void by the rule of perpetuity. HELD: 1)The trial court held that it was only after the time of vesting had been ascertained that a determination could be made about whether that time was too remote and therefore in contravention of the rule. 2)The parties' original lease was in the public domain and could be read as being void under the rule on perpetueties. 3)The respondent did not engage in a farmout agreement with the defendant. Rather he negotiated a farm out agreement with Tarragon. This involved due diligence examination and for that purpose Tarragon opened its files and disclosed to Maxx the only existing copy of the agreement between them. Maxx was very interested in developing or participating in the mineral rights within the Taylor land. It was only then that the rule could be removed. 4)The court declined to admit that the trial judge's finding that the 'top leases' of the appellant were void under s.17 of the common law rule against fraud was justified. Rather, it could not and declined to attempt to do so."

He agreed to pay support based on an imputed annual income of $17,386, although he remained unemployed. HELD: A trial of the issue was directed, as it could not be decided on the material filed whether he was intentionally unemployed or underemployed. The father's circumstances had changed since the consent order. The fact he no longer resided with a girlfriend and was making payments on a truck did not justify any reduction. Income should not be imputed based on former employment that is no longer available or practicable.","FIAT. The respondent father applied to vary a consent order dated April 5, 2001 by reducing his required child support payments from $236 per month to $19.00 per month. The consent order was granted one month after the respondent had quit his employment at Lilydale Foods. Although he remained unemployed, the respondent agreed to pay child support based upon an imputed annual income of $17,386. He purchased a one-half ton truck on which he had been making payments of $624. He claimed that his circumstances had changed since April 2001, when he was now employed as a tow truck driver and earning an annualized income of only $7,510. He had purchased a 1-halfton truck on the basis that he was earning less than what he had actually been earning. HELD: 1)The real issue is whether the respondent is intentionally underemployed or unemployed within the meaning of s.19(1)(a) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The Federal Child Suppression Guidelines do not mandate a reduction in child support obligations. 2)A trial of whether the Respondent is intentionally unemployed was directed. The registrar was directed to determine whether the issue was on the same material filed."
c_2012nsca78.txt,", motion denied. While the province has an arguable appeal, it does not concern a summary judgment motion that would result in the claims being dismissed outright. If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims. The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding. There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved. The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file. To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost.","The plaintiffs brought a class action lawsuit against the defendants, alleging that their facilities emitted lead, arsenic, PAH's and other toxins. They also sought certification under s. 7(1) of the certification order. The defendants had not filed notice of defence until 45 days after the certification ordered was issued. They then brought a motion for stay, arguing that the stay would cause irreparable harm in one of the two manners identified in the test: tort and for breach of fiduciary duty. The motion for a stay was granted and the defendants were ordered to file notice of appeal. The judge reviewed the causes of action and found that the plaintiffs' proposal to establish two classes of claimants, property owner and residential, was reasonable and logical and would facilitate the management and advancement of the case. There was no evidence that the proposed geographic boundaries would alter the reality of the claimants' claim significantly higher because of the points in issue. Vague and conclusory statements of counsel, without evidence, do not establish the prerequisites for stay of an enforceable order."

The chambers judge found that the appellant had ignored the clear words of s.37 of the Workers' Compensation Act in reaching its decision, and thus had exceeded its jurisdiction; the decision was quashed and the matter remitted back to the Board. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the order to quash, that s.37 of the Act was not a section limiting the Board's jurisdiction and that, considering s.37 and s.53 of the Act, the decision of the Board was not patently erroneous.","This was an appeal from a decision allowing an application for certiorari to quash a decision of the Workers' Compensation Board and remitting the matter to the Board to determine the rate of compensation payable to the respondent. The respondent had worked for several years for M-I Drilling Fluids Canada and experienced periods of layoff and then re-off. In 1993, he was laid off full-time employment. He was awarded compensation for one day of work per week, alternating between contract and part-time work. In 1994, the same employer engaged the respondent in two separate ways: contract employment, which included one eight hour day per week; and part time employment. In 1995, the respondent was laidoff from these employment. His compensation was reduced to being paid half-time. In 1996, the Board of Directors held that the hearing officer had ignored the clear words of s. 37 and had arbitrarily decided upon a different rate of pay.

The essential facts were not in dispute.

This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site. Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available. Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced. The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching. No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision. The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups. 2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible. There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor. The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship. The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","The defendant was charged with seven violations of The Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993. The defendant had been a self-employed person who had obtained a contract from the Hamlet to install sewer and water lines on four lots in the Hamlets. The contract required that the defendant install the lines on the four lots using the services of an individual who was also a contractor. The contractor arranged for the defendant to pay wages on an hourly basis and the defendant was to provide the workers with a backhoe, backhoe and pipe. The construction industry standard definition for 'employer' is 'Worker' as defined in s. 2(i) of the Act. The relationship between the defendant and the workers was one of an employer to workers and the Act defines'self-employed' as 'a person engaged in an occupation but is not in the service of an Employer'. The Act does not define 'due diligence' but well established case authority simply defines this as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. The evidence established that the relationship between Pederson Sr. and the plaintiffs was one that was akin to 'employee to worker' and that the contract was made with the intent of making profit. The fact that the nephew of the defendant arranged for his nephew to work with him does not make the defendant an employer since the three men understood that this would be work for wages in the context of the employer. The court ruled that the uncle acted as'sub-contractor' because he directed the work and directed the workers to do the work. The plaintiff arranged for a nephew to help him work with the defendant because he was extremely busy with other business matters. The defendants arranged for their nephew to watch over the two men and the incident occurred because the defendant had not paid any attention to the contract. The nephew was not working with the defendants and died because he suffocated due to lack of oxygen. The Court held that the evidence established by the court was not analogous to the relationship the defendant controlled and that he directed them to do work and he had ultimate responsibility for the worksite and completion of the project. The facts were not in dispute and the law applied to the defendant. The father did not recognize or give recognition to his responsibilities imposed by law on the workers but the fact that he arranged for another nephew to assist in the trenching did not make him an employer."
c_2008nssm39.txt,"The applicant law firm applied for a taxation of accounts in a complicated family law matter. The client contended that there was obvious overbilling and that the solicitor was negligent in failing to specify in an interim Order the actual time at which she had to leave the matrimonial home. Accounts as presented are certified; there was no indication whatsoever of overbilling, whether with respect to legal fees or disbursements, and there was no negligence on the part of the solicitor as she had acted reasonably in relying on the representations of the husband's lawyer as to when the Order would be enforced. It is not always necessary to examine every single entry in detail on a line-by-line basis; an overall view of the entries contained in an account can be taken when assessing reasonableness. The temporal limitation of cross-examination is within the Small Claims Court's scope of discretion in special circumstances.","The applicant sought a taxation of the accounts that it issued to the respondent. The respondent opposed the application, claiming that the applicant's legal accounts were overbilled. The applicant argued that the respondent's estranged husband had either been convicted of or plead guilty to a criminal charge and he did not pay a significant fine associated with the crime. The Respondent's counsel objected, arguing that the trial judge should not have asked the applicant to attend. The appellant argued that to limit cross-examination in this manner would constitute breach of natural justice. The trial judge was successful, as she had every opportunity to challenge the respondent on several occasions. The issue before the trial court was whether the respondent authorized the applicant, who represented herself at taxation, to cross-examine her. The evidence presented by the respondent and the applicant was not straightforward, and the court found that the time available to the applicant would be limited by the limitation on cross- examination. The issues were, firstly, the complexity of the legal picture, the criminal proceedings against the respondent, and secondly, the fact that the appellant's estranged spouse had either pled guilty or plead a guilty to the crime and thus did not have a significant fines payable. The taxation hearing before the applicant more closely resembled a trial than an application and thus the court preferred the respondent’s evidence over the applicant’ s. 8 evidence."

The appellant's solicitor at the time of the trial had called no expert evidence concerning either the proper construction of the chimney, which was alleged to be faultily constructed, or the cause of the fire. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V, including costs of the motion to adduce fresh evidence. 1)The evidence was clearly available, clearly contemplated by the parties and for whatever reason not called. 2)The trial judge neither misapprehended nor failed to take into account evidence which was before him in arriving at his conclusion concerning the causation of the fire. There was evidence to permit the trial judge to make the findings of fact that he did and to award the damages based on those findings.","The appellants applied to adduce fresh evidence and to amend the statement of claim in the within action. The tests for the admission of fresh evidence were set out in R. v. Lensen, [1980] S.C.R. 672 and [1988] SCC 1 S.A. 673. The appellant contended that the expert evidence which he wished to tender was relevant, credible and if believed could reasonably, when taken with all the other evidence, be expected to affect the result. He candidly conceded that, with due diligence it could have been adduced at the trial. HELD: The application to ad duce fresh information and to add the statementof defence was denied. 1)The tests for admission of new evidence were well known and were set down in R.' v.

1996canlii6900.txt,"A decree nisi and an order granting custody to the mother was made in 1995. Upon appeal the Court of Appeal directed a new trial. Changes in circumstances included the fact that the child was developmentally delayed and required a special program. A pediatrician testified that inconsistency in parenting approaches would further delay the child's development. HELD: Custody was awarded to the father. 1)Each parent was a capable caregiver. However, the father was available to provide full-time care due to an employment disability and exhibited a strong desire to do so. The past physical abuse of his former spouse was not considered relevant as it did not affect his ability to parent the child. 2)The mother was to have weekly access on two non-consecutive days for eight hours and two hours on a third day. The child was to sleep in the same bed every night.","Saskatchewan: Two parents sought custody of the one child who was not their child. Each parent presented volumes of evidence respecting the shortcomings of the other, all with the view of discrediting the other's ability to act as the custodial parent. HELD: 1)The issues were in the context of divorce action. The issues were the central issue of what custody would be in the best interests of the child. 2)The father was unable to work and was dependent on disability payments from an insurer. The mother was unable and unwilling to work, travel and play with the child and the father's serious need for consistency in his parenting. 3)The child was the focus of the trial and the court found that both parents had demonstrated a level of consistency that required a change in the child's needs. 4)Each parent was a capable caregiver. Each was entitled to have their child in the custody of their respective children. 5)The court found it appropriate to award custody to the first child where her needs required it most. The second child was special needs and was under the direction and care of one parent for an extended period of time. The third child was at one home with each parent. The parents' relationship was good and was not defined by their past conduct. The father demonstrated a strong desire to have his child in his care. The child had a special needs child who required regular physical and emotional care."
2006skqb189.txt,"FIAT: The issues on this application are with respect to extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousal support. HELD: 1) The petitioner's income is $73,000 versus $29,000 for the respondent. The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2) The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law. At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law. What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents? Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support? 2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.  3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse. These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI. These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case. However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future.","FIAT: The respondent moves for an order granting to her, (1) joint custody and primary care of the child with access to her former spouse with access also to her ex-husband; (2) interim spousal support in the sum of $750 per month retroactive to January 1, 2006; and (3) interim child support in $750.00 per month. The petitioner is not opposed to an order requesting (or more appropriately 'confirming') joint custody of the daughter with the respondent with the primary residence of the girl and the parties agree that the established status quo of shared parenting shall also be included in this order. The childcare costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to the child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spOUSal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issues in the future. HELD: 1) The parties agreed on custody, access, basic child support, entitlement and spousAL support. 2) Each party presented meritorious arguments as to the outstanding issues dealing with extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousals. 3) The petitioner was ordered to pay 71% of the childcare costs which is monthly sum of approximately $125. In the likely event that the petitioner's health plan covers the residual cost of Keandra's asthma medication not paid for by the respondent, the petitioner shall bear 71%of special or extraordinary costs if any are payable as consequence of this fiat. 4) The Court found that the childcare and asthma meditations were of sufficient proportion and peculiar as to not expected in the table amounts of child/child support and their income, and accordingly ordered that the respondent pay 71 % of those costs which are pro rata to the petitioner."
9_2001canlii390.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code and with driving over.08 contrary to ss. 253C and 253(b). The accused was cooperative throughout and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and breath demand. The officer also noted that the accused's eyes were glassy and glassy, and he appeared to fully comprehend the circumstances in which he was involved. HELD: The accused's evidence of slurred speech was not reliable. The police officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking and walked him back to the police vehicle, and did no issue with balance or walking. The accused did not slurring his speech or difficulties with balance. The evidence of a strong smell of alcohol and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot was not sufficient to establish reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand, based upon the accused sleeping through the two green traffic lights and the strong smell and alcohol. Therefore, the accused was not guilty of the charge under s. s.8 and s253(a). The Court held that in the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not insufficient to prove the offence under s253C and s254(a), and the accused is not guilty."
6_2005nssc128.txt,"Pursuant to the Corollary Relief Judgment, the parents had been equally sharing the parenting time of their two children for four years. The father now applied for interim sole custody, alleging that the ongoing extreme conflict between the parties was adversely affecting the children. An assessment recommended that the children live with the father and have access with the mother. Father granted interim sole care, custody and control of the children. The serious concerns raised by the assessment satisfied the threshold requirement of a material change in circumstances; the urgency of the concerns required immediate action.","The father applied to vary the terms of the parties' 2001 Corollary Relief Judgment respecting parenting. The parties had entered into a Separation Agreement in 2000 and were in a Separations Agreement in 2001. The father had shared primary care and control of the children, but the wife had been more involved in the children's activities. The children were now in the father's care and needed a stable, loving home. The mother had refused to implement the assessment recommendations, and they had been in conflict for several years. The son, now 9 years old, was placed in the primary care of the father. Both parents were capable of caring for the children. A detailed assessment of the parents was conducted in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. The findings of the assessment were all incorporated into the variation application. The essence of the issues was that both parents were incapable of responding to the childrens needs, and there was a serious conflict between the father and the mother. The evidence showed that both parties were unable to provide the children with the necessities they needed to succeed in order to assist them in their new lives. The primary care for the son was to be with the father, who provided a more stable environment for the boys. The assessment report reflected the mother's ability to be flexible in hearing, understanding and integrating the individual emotional needs of the boys, and that the findings of this assessment were to be implemented at the very earliest opportunity."
b_2018skca27.txt,"HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed. The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced. The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one. She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence. The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony;  2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference. He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA. The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016. Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice. To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation.","The appellant was convicted after trial of sexually assaulting his 11-year-old niece contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The appellant also appealed his sentence. The sentence appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was varied to 12 months of probation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The conviction appeal was based on credibility and not on hearsay. The trial judge made no specific findings of fact related to reliability or credibility of the former babysitter. The focus of sentencing under the Youth Criminal Justice Act is balancing conflicting principles to arrive at a sentence that stems from the trial judge's findings of truth based on the complainant's testimony. The evidence must meet the criteria for the admission of fresh evidence as set forth in Palmer (1979), 1979 CanLII (SCC), [1980] SCR 759 at 775 and the trial court made no finding of incompetent trial counsel pursuant to R v W.(D.)."
1997canlii11078.txt,"The applicant sought to be appointed as property guardian for his uncle pursuant to s19 of the Dependent Adults Act. The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years. The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs. He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951. Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew. There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property. However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit. His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest. 2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.  3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand. One half of the proceeds were to be provided directly to Hand to be dealt with as he chooses and the remaining half were to be administered by the Public Trustee in his longer term best interests according to the normal powers and procedures of that office.","The applicant sought the appointment of the property guardian pursuant to s. 19 of The Dependent Adults Act. The applicant had been living with his nephew and had not succeeded in managing his affairs for some time.

HELD: The application was granted. 1)The applicant was 76 years old and had been residing with his grandmother. He was also of the opinion that he was mentally challenged. He requested that the land be vested directly in his name, rather than in his uncle's. 2)The land was to be given to the applicant as part of the terms of his tenancy. 3)The court found that the applicant was entitled to manage his property unless he was not competent to do so. 4)The Public Trustee Act was relevent. The Act provided that the person who held the land should firstly be the property's property guardian and then the public trustee. 5)The respondent was to appoint the public trustee as his property guardian in the event that the application was not made in the applicant's name. 6)The prescribed prescribed amount of time for application should be paid in the amount of $7,000 to the respondent. 7)The application was adjourned for 45 days to allow the respondent to bring an application back. 8)The public trustee was to issue a new title for the land."

Section 37 of The Wills Act permits the Court to order a document to be fully effective as a Will notwithstanding that it was not executed in compliance with all the formal requirements imposed by the Act.

The result favoured joining the federation.

HELD: 1) The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable. In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations. In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice? This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues. The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer? 2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice. When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice. The applicant is entitled to a portion of the relief he seeks.

HELD: 1) The applicant has no standing to bring an application under s. 135 of the Non-profit Corporation Act. The EB has been found to be unable to ratify the result. In this jurisdiction such relief is discretionary. 2) The court must first determine what approach it should take in the context of overturning a vote. To read the word 'election' in the section as anything other than referring to the election of director or auditor requires interpretive contortions beyond my ability. 3) The substantive issues distill to whether the applicant has standing under s 135 of The Non Profit Corporations act, 1995 (Act s. 225). Section 225 addresses an application by a complainant. It is common ground, by all, that the applicant is a former director. 4) The conduct complained of by the applicant falls within the ambit of s.225(1). The authority in s.220(2) gives the court the necessary power to address such wrongs and are sufficiently broad so as to subsume an order declaring a referendum of no force or effect. 5) In this case the burden lies on the party seeking the right to cross-examine to show the examination will assist in resolving the issue before the chambers judge. 6) The application to strike portions of the affidavits submitted on behalf of others is academic given the relief available to the applicant under s.(225)."
6_1999skqb124.txt,"The plaintiff who had been employed by the defendant's predecessor for 23 years as office manager and bookkeeper until 1997, brought an action for damages against her new employers for dismissal without adequate notice. The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998. The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period. Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause. Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time. Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. She remained entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at the time of termination and to medical expenses that would have been covered but without bonuses or extra payments for sick pay. 2)The defendant did not establish the plaintiff ought to have done more to mitigate her loss. There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.  3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment. Amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant were to be deducted. 4)The plaintiff was entitled to interest in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 5)The defendant could make no deduction for insurance benefit payments. Sections 45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act was drawn to their attention. 6)The plaintiff was awarded costs. Fees were to be taxed on column 2. 7)The plaintiff was to deliver a copy of the calculation of the judgment. Either could issue judgment with the other's consent as to form and content.

The court accepted that equal latitude may be required in the plaintiff's cross-examination of the defendant's witnesses to mitigate the blow to the plaintiff from bad mood. Although there had been some unpleasantness and some unpleasantries, the plaintiff had made a positive start to her new employment. The anxiety and depression that developed in the workplace during the past few months combined to create the hostile atmosphere which resulted in the termination of her employment insurance benefits. Equal latitude was to also be given to the defendant to price out work orders."

She also stated that just prior to this she was awakened by the feeling of someone touching her vagina. The accused was charged with sexual assault and sexual touching of the complainant., accused found not guilty; the complainant's testimony was internally inconsistent and her cross-examination revealed obvious errors which were never corrected to rehabilitate her credit. The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and the accused's evidence raised reasonable doubts in the court's mind.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching of the complainant. The complainant was a close friend of the accused's. She recalled that the accused had often slept over with her and that she sometimes felt something in her pyjamas, sometimes while she was asleep, but never saw him. She also recalled that she had sometimes seen him remove his clothing and go to the bathroom. She alleged that he touched her breast and vaginal area while she slept. The accused denied touching her or touching her. He entered the living room after he finished watching a movie. The parties were enjoying a pizza party when the complainant awoke. The evening was quiet and everyone was enjoying a movie when the accused and the girls retired to their respective bedrooms. The next morning, the complainant woke up and noticed that the man standing beside the bed had touched her. She testified that she felt something inside her pyajamas, about her vaginal area, and then moved to the window on the opposite side of the bed. When she awoke, she saw the accused standing beside her. When the girls had finished watching TV, the accused left the room and went to the other side of bed. The two girls had a quiet evening and the accused, who had not been seen by the complainant, left the bedroom. The police attended to investigate. The first accused was found not guilty.

The evidence before the chambers judge was meagre but showed that the father had not seen the child for the past four years. The mother appealed., appeal dismissed; the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act. He did not place too much emphasis on the child's loss of a potential relationship with and support from the father on the facts of this case.",The single mother appealed the November 2004 decision of the Children and Family Services judge refusing to grant her the adoption she sought with respect to her four year old daughter. The appellant was not married at the time of the daughter's birth and remained single. The child's father had not had contact with her nor given any child support since November 2000. There was no evidence as to why there had been no contact between the child and her father since November2000 or whether he was or is presently able to provide financial support for her and whether the appellant ever sought child support. It was not known how the child was supported from November 2000 when the father ceased support until February 2003 when the appellant started her present job. The father was not notified of the application and has not consented. Notice of the proposed adoption was given to the Minister of Community Services as required by s.76(1) of the Act. The Minister made no recommendation with respect the adoption and did not conduct a home study. The judge refused to grant the adoption on the basis that it was not in the child's best interests to do so even though he found all of the technical requirements for the adoption had been complied with. He agreed with the appellant that the father was entitled to notice and was not required to consent to the adoption as a result of the interplay between s.67(1)(f) and s.70(1(1)). He also agreed with her that the child would continue to be in exactly the same position in terms of her relationship with and support from her father. The only evidence before the judge was the usual documentation provided to court with an application for an uncontested adoption. The minister chose not to intervene or to take any position on the appeal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the chambers judge erred in not considering other relevant circumstances in determining the best interests of the child in determining whether the proposed adoptions were in the best interest of the children. The Court also dismissed the application for a reversible error in law in refusing to award the application.
2_2003skpc44.txt,"The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b). Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600. The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'. The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on. The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement. Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair. The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts. At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven. 1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA. If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group. Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive. It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so. The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation. It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time). 3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character. 4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period. The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product. The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed.","The plaintiff was not a partner in Triple R and was engaged in consignment auto sales with Triple R's knowledge and consent. Triple R was engaged primarily in consignee auto sales. The sole financial benefit for this activity was to go to the plaintiff. The plaintiff was very unhappy with the vehicle. He sought recovery of the purchase price and the costs that he had incurred for repair and inspection. HELD: 1)The plaintiff did reject the product. In the circumstances, the plaintiff did not make known the purpose for which this vehicle was required. That purpose was to provide transportation for his daughter and her children. 2)The vehicle was driven almost 5,000 kilometres. 3)The dealer was entitled to compensation for the time and effort it had taken him to get the vehicle repaired. 4)The court concluded that a consigne is a retail seller within the meaning of the Act and accordingly that Triple R is deemed to have given to the defendant the warranties set out in the Act. 5)The automobile was driven over 5,800 km. The court awarded the plaintiff's total recovery of $1842.35. The dealer was awarded costs of the repairs and inspection totalling $242.35, which were foreseeable and properly recoverable."
c_2017skqb144.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the property be sold and the proceeds of sale take into account the amount necessary to protect the respondent father’s claim. The Partition Act, 1868 applies in the province. It did not allow the equitable principles of unjust enrichment and constructive trust to operate to create a proprietary interest. The court found that s. 4 of the Act applied, which provides a monetary remedy so that if the respondent father could establish entitlement to some amount for his maintenance and improvement costs, he would be protected for that amount for his costs.","The parties apply for partition and sale of lake front recreational property owned by them together with their brother. Each of the parties owns an undivided one quarter interest as tenants in common in the property. The property is located next door to another that until recently was the permanent residence of the parents. They are now separated and may have to be sold. The parties argue that the benefit and corresponding detriment must have occurred without juristic reason. They claim that Ronald, through the operation of the principle of unjust enrichment and resulting or constructive trusts, has contributed approximately $40,000 in materials and $40k in time to maintain and improve the property and that these improvements have added to the value of the Property. They also claim that the proceeds from the sale are over and above the contributions of the others. HELD: 1) The Court has a discretion to refuse partition under s. and s. 4. This opens the door to consider the manner in which the parties organized their relationship and whether an injustice has arisen that without equity cannot be remedied. 2) There are three elements that must be satisfied in order for a claim in unjust enrichment to succeed: there must be an enrichment of the defendant, corresponding deprivation of the plaintiff, and an absence of juristic reasons for the enrichment. The Court's Discretion Under the Act is limited to refusing partition under the s. because it is not reasonable to expect the parties to realize their capital value. The application will have to go to s. 6. This necessitates determining whether it is s. or s. which operates in these circumstances.  3) If owners holding 'One Moiety (a half interest) or more' request partition and a partition and Sale s. directs that the court shall, unless it seems good reason to the contrary, direct Sale of the property whereas if the owners requesting the relief hold less than half interest it is S. that operates. The discretion to deny recovery may be made in light of the fact that the order would cause inconvenience and hardship to the defendant would not be sufficient reason to refuse the relief sought. 4) If the parties agree to a partition or sale, the Court may make all necessary or proper consequential directions which may include, where one of the owners gives an undertaking to purchase the interest of the party requesting sale, valuation of theproperty. The court will also take all necessary and proper steps to ensure that the remedy of constructive trust will be granted. 5) The application is allowed as long as it is governed by s. 2.

e_2005skqb549.txt,"There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor-client basis. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought notice of motion seeking an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items. The defendants made an order in February 2005 directing that the plaintiff and the defendants supply the defendants with an order providing an accounting for all funds received from, held on behalf of or invested on behalfof Margaret Fehr. The plaintiffs opposed each of the requests on the basis that they would be inappropriate in light of the overall context of the litigation. HELD: 1)The plaintiff's motion does not require the defendant to make any payment to purchase or redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the court is in agreement with the plaintiff's contention that the corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares in essence but rather, following judgment however and whenever it would be, it would BE subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. 2)The affidavit of the plaintiff deposed positively to the facts in question, verifies the cause of action and the amount claimed as due. 3)There is no dispute as to the nature of the plaintiffs' entitlement under appropriate circumstances to redeem the plaintiff’s preferred shares. 4)The cross-examination of the defendant on his affidavit disclosed that Peak Enterprises Inc. is a profitable company and that it is not seeking summary judgment. The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s.34(2). 5)The plaintiffs’ application for summary judgment was brought under Rules 129 and 133 of the Queen’’ Bench Rules. The plaintiff asserted a number of grounds as to why she sought summary judgment, including that the defendant was not making any payment whatsoever relating to the structure of the preferred shares, their holders were not entitled to any rights to the information, the realizable value of the company was less than the aggregate of its liabilities and the value of Peak’d assets would be less than its liabilities. 6)The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff in her application for Summary judgment did not represent debt or liquidated demand as that phrase is contemplated in Rule 129. The amount sought in particular did not reflect the nature or extent of the corporation’ s. 34(2) obligations. The only real issue was whether the plaintiff was entitled to summary judgment"

Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600, that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages. The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company. The damages are the amount by which the actual value of the company was less than what the respondent paid at the time of purchase.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages flowing from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business. The appellant was a businessman living in Port Hawkesbury and the numbered company was his vehicle used to acquire the shares. The numbered company had a large inventory of parts and the customers it dealt with were not impressed with the cash flow management company. The trial judge found that the appellant would not have purchased the company if he had known the true financial condition of the company. He therefore awarded direct damages of $200,000, which were $1,800,000 less than the $1.8 million awarded for direct damages. The Court found that it was impossible for the respondent to establish his direct loss as a result of the misrepresentations made by the financial statements, and that he should have taken steps to remedy this. The award of direct damages was $200k, which was $1 million less than $1 in the amount awarded for consequential damages."

The lottery money was spent on household finances and lost in husband's small business venture. Husband 'spent more money on alcohol than he should have'. HELD: This did not amount to dissipation of matrimonial property within the meaning of the Act. Husband's mismanagement of the family's financial affairs was grounds for unequal division of the property:","The applicant sought a division of matrimonial property, custody and maintenance for the two youngest children, aged 8 and 8 years, and custody of the three other children, ages 8 and 9 years. The respondent had been in charge of the family finances from the outset of their marriage in Mexico and shortly thereafter moved to Saskatchewan. The family had difficulty getting along on the respondent's earnings. In 1977, the respondent borrowed money and bought some equipment to trench the matrimonial home which failed and resulted in substantial loss. The trenching equipment was repossessed, the matriconial home had to be sold and the mini-motor home was gone. The applicant sought to have the respondent keep his vehicle and his tools and other properties in his possession as his own. HELD: 1)The respondent was to be given custody of his two younger children and custody under the Infants Act. 2)The applicant was to have her name shown on the property and her name also shown on her matrimony property. 3)The respondents were to have custody of their own children and to have their property rent by the respondent for purposes of the Rent Offering Ordinance. 4)The court was satisfied the respondent had dissipated the matron property within the meaning of the Property Act. The fact that he was entitled to keep his tool and tools and to keep household items in his own possession as a personal possession for purposes only made sense.  5)The petitioner was to pay the arrears of child support in the amount of $1,800 and the respondent was ordered to pay $1.800 for the matrices and to rent out the lot in Hague for the purposes of his rent for the purpose of the day. 6)The property was to remain divided equally.

e_2013skqb390.txt,"HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault. The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently.","The accused was found guilty, after trial, of two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271. The accused had been drinking and the two victims stayed at the accused's residence. While the two women were there, the accused touched the complainant's breasts and vaginal area, touching her and touching her back and shoulders. The complainant told the probation officer that the accused had a back problem that prevented him from gaining employment. The probation officer conducted two risk assessments and found the accused at low risk to re-offend, which was a factor that would support a conditional sentence. The Crown did not offer a DNA sample, and the accused was sentenced to 30 months incarceration. HELD: The accused was convicted of sexual interference and of sexual harassment. The Court of Appeal varied the sentence based on the factors set out in R. v. Revet, 2010 SKQB 71 (CanLII), 350 Sask. R. 191 and cases cited therein. 1) The accused is 61 years old and had two previous convictions of sexual interfere. He was employed by the employer of the complainant. He has a previous criminal record, which includes convictions for sexual interference. He is on social assistance. He lives in the community. He works in the retail store and is on a social assistance program. He does not appear to have any prior record. He worked in the store and was on social assist. He lived in the residence with the victims. The parties had a house party and the victim and the defendant went to the accused’s house. The defendant was drinking and was late to the party. The two victims hid under the covers of the defendant’ s clothes. The police arrived at the residence and found that the defendant had grabbed the victim’ss breasts and her clothing and touched her breasts and crotch. The victim told the accused that she had been sexually assaulted and the parties left the party after hearing the accused speak about his experiences with the victim. The court found that this was a single incident of sexual touching that occurred over a period of 2 years and the complainant was not at high risk to offend. The evidence showed that the complainant had some cognitive issues but she was not, in my view, severely cognitively impaired. The sentencing guidelines for sexual assaults in Canada were set out. The sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit."
5_1994canlii5076.txt,"FIAT The accused, who was charged with two counts of sexual assault involving complainants 15 and 13 years of age, applied for a remedy under ss.24(1) of the Charter of Rights compelling the respondent to provide full disclosure to him, without trust conditions or undertakings of any sort. HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter. The obligation to disclose is not absolute. The Corwn's obligation to protect the privacy of the complainants is fulfuilled by providing the statements and videotapes to counsel for the accused on trust condition that counsel retain them in his possession. The information contained therein is available to the accused and retained experts for use in preparing his defence. Since the accused knows the sustance of the complaints and, therefore, the case he has to meet, there is no danger to the fairness of the trial by virtue of the trust condition attached to disclosure. The public interest is served and the integrity of the criminal justice system is maintained when complainants are assured that staements and videotapes will not be reproduced. Application dismissed.","FIAT. A person charged with two counts of sexual assault applied for a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter and s. 650(3) of Criminal Code compelling the respondent to provide full and complete disclosure of the complainant statements. The sole issue was whether the imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of these statements would prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by s. 7 and 11 of the charter. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The material filed by the Crown was sufficient to establish a considerable problem with wrongful use of complainant statements generally but not the degree in which it exists in this jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal made specific mention of the respondent's failure to provide copies of certain disclosure material to the accused. 2)The respondent was restricted by the court to only giving copies to the applicant. He did not make any undertakings as required by the Charter. 3)The court found that the accused's rights pursuant to s.7, 11(a) and 11(d) of The Charter were violated. The court found the Crown's failure, in making disclosure, to restrict access to third parties, was inconsistent with the accused s.8 right to privacy. 4)The Court of appeal did not find that the respondent breached the accuseds right to fair trial. The appeal court found it could not accept the defence submission that the videotape evidence was improper and contrary to the right to freedom of expression. 5)The accuseds right of freedom of thought was at risk because he was under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The videotape material was found to have been obtained by the accused in the wrong way. The accused¹s right not to share in the disclosure and defence of his alleged victims rights under s7 and 11.

It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.,"Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Statement of Interest – Sale of PropertyCivil Procedure The sole issue on appeal is whether the plaintiffs and their lawyer should be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff because of a conflict of interest. The sole issues on appeal are whether the lawyers with Phillips Co. should be prohibited from continuing in act for this plaintiff because they have a conflictof interest. HELD: 1) The court found that the conflict of interests existed between the parties. The court applied the Martin test which states that a lawyer who purports to conduct litigation adverse to the former client in relation to a matter connected to the first retainer will be disqualified. 2) The Court found that both parties agreed that the lawyer's job was to refrain from misusing confidential information. The fact that the Holgates and the lawyer who prepared the agreements for them were in the position of representing the plaintiff and the fact that they had a mutual understanding of the terms of the agreement and their continued occupation constitutes trespass to land. 3) The relationship between the law firm and the plaintiff was one dimension of this duty and the Court was satisfied that the relationship between them was one which was reasonably maintained. 4) The lawyer's obligation to former clients was not limited to the meeting with the Holgs. The lawyer prepared the Agreements for the client and the parties had a corresponding meeting regarding the purchase and sale of the plaintiff's farm property. The parties were able to contact each other and the agreement was signed. The Holgaters had a different lawyer but the lawyer prepared all of the agreements. The plaintiff was not disinterested in having her lawyer represent her. The law firm was not bound by the terms, the terms or the confidentiality obligations owed to its former clients. The agreement was sufficiently related to the purchase price and the original retainer that only a reasonable person would have thought that confidential information was imparted. The requirement that all of these documents be considered in the context of the consent agreement was met by the lawyer. The judge applied the Calico test because he believed that the information imparted was purely procedural and benign and not ultimately relevant to the suit. The same result was achieved by applying the Martin principles and presumptions. 4 The court also found that in circumstances where a lawyer purports not to raise conflict of Interest concerns prior to issuing the plaintiff’s statement of claim and that the within action was preceded by a writ of possession and analogous proceedings involving the plaintiff, the fact remains that the judge was not able to determine whether the lawyer possessed confidential information"

The complainant swore she tried to flee several times after the melee in the hotel room, but was prevented by the defendant, who was senior and more experienced in the trades, being at large on his recognizance entered into before a Justice or a Judge and being bound to comply with a condition that he not contact or communicate directly or indirectly with the complainant except through a member of the Law Society of Saskatchewan. The defendant was convicted of assault causing grievous bodily harm. The evidence showed that the defendant had punched the complainant in the face several times, choked her and then threatened to kill her. The Court found that the complainant had credible information that he had paid for everything, including the drugs and liquor, and that he was the driving force behind the events. Defendant found guilty of assault, unlawful imprisonment and utterING death threats; the elements required for self-defence were not present. The accused did not appear forthright in his testimony, reject unequivocally the complainant's account, accept that of the complainant and acknowledge that of him."
d_1996canlii7113.txt,"The question was whether a corporate board could breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government sponsored community bond program in order to establish its business. The Shareholders' Agreement obliged all shareholders to vote their shares so as to confirm the nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard for its performance. As a result the board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though the Government of Saskatchewan and Bondco were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the company, they could not change the board and did not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes. Members of Bondco were concerned that jobs were being obtained in Saskatoon at the expense of Rosetown jobs and the economic spin-offs expected from their $800,000 investment were not being realized in Rosetown due to the opening of the Saskatoon facility. An application was brought under s234 of the Business Corporations Act. They sought a restraining order enforcing the covenant, an order appointing new directors, an order of compensation for breach of contract and an order directing the closure of the Saskatoon operation and the return of company assets to Rosetown district unless Bondco granted written consent. HELD: It was ordered that 1)the Shareholders Agreement was amended deleting the offending paragraph concerning the Board of Directors and substituting a new paragraph; 2)certain provisions of the Articles of Continuance as amended were suspended until the Termination Date; 3)the present board was suspended pending the election of directors at a special meeting of shareholders; 4)the respondent was enjoined from moving its operations and from transferring or hiring employees at any place other than Rosetown District unless Bonco's written consent was filed with the Court. 5)The Chief Executive Officer was not displaced nor was the Saskatoon operation directed to be closed.  6)Bonco was entitled to its taxable costs against the individual respondents.",The applicant sought to have a corporate board breached its undertaking to remain in a small community when it took advantage of a government-sponsored community bond program in order to establish itsbusiness. The applicant also sought an order restraining the director from moving to Saskatoon and a restraining order ordered that he be removed from the company. The director was not seeking removal from the municipality. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court was not directing the closure of the Saskatoon operation. The directors were to be directed to return the company assets to the Rural Municipality of St Andrews. 1)The director was to be put on notice that the will of the shareholders and the contracts under which the company was formed were not to be brushed aside. 2)The applicant was directed to take appropriate steps to prevent the director's unlawful move and to make arrangements for the closure and return of company assets. 3)The court had the power to make sweeping changes in the corporation's affairs.
1998canlii13992.txt,"The plaintiff's residence, a mobile home, was totally destroyed by fire in 1996. The insure denied liability on the policy alleging the plaintiff deliberately started the fire or caused it to be started. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)When the evidence of the three independant witnesses was considered, the defendant insurer met the onus referred to Grover Holdings and established that the fire was deliberately set. While there was no direct evidence to establish the plaintiff set the fire himself, the inference was drawn that he did or, in the alternative, caused someone else to do so.  2)Had the plaintiff been in the mobile home he should have been suffering to some degree from carbon monoxide poisoning, he should have been coughing, his hair should have been singed, he would have had soot on his face and his clothes would have smelled of smoke. 3)The plaintiff did not call evidence to rebut the fire investigator's opinion that a significant quantity of fire accelerant had been used nor was his brother called to confirm his testimony that he attempted to re-enter the mobile home after arranging for the fire department to be called.","The plaintiff's residence, mobile home and contents were insured with the defendant.

8_2009nssc261.txt,"The Trustee opposed the bankrupt's application for a discharge on various grounds. The bankrupt supported four children and had been discharged from the military due to illness arising from her active service. The bankrupt will be entitled to an absolute discharge once certain conditions are met, including the payment of one month's rent, the value of the horses and surplus income for nine months to the Trustee. The bankrupt's disability pension from Veterans' Affairs was not included in the calculation of surplus income as the public policy reason behind the exemption for proceeds received due to personal injury and a soldier's danger pay applied to this disability pension. The Trustee had no claim to the insurance proceeds received by the bankrupt following the loss of her home by fire as it was a modest sum used to replace lost personal exempt assets; the three horses were found to be owned by the bankrupt as opposed to her children, for whom she had purchased them as pets and were included in the value of her estate; the court exercised its discretion in determining the amount of surplus income, noting that the administration of the estate had been unusually hostile and it was important that the bankrupt be able to stabilize her family finances.","The respondent asked that she be discharged from bankruptcy as she suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Major Depression Disorder and Borderline Personality Organization. She also asked that her horses be discharged as assets of the estate. She requested that they be included in her discharge application as she suffers from Post-Traumatic Stress disorder, Major depression Disorder and Chronic Adjustment Disorder. HELD: The respondent was entitled to an absolute discharge. 1)The respondent was not asked to make detailed analysis of what is exempt and what is not exempt. The evidence at the hearing was that she did not provide any proper documentation. 2)The trustee raised a number of issues. She was not the only respondent. She paid $300 for the horses. 3)She deposited surplus income as provided in paragraph 45 of her discharge notice.  4)The judge determined that the horses were exempt. They had little or no value. The respondent should be allowed to keep them in her possession for the purposes of calculating surplus income. 5)The court found that the respondent had no obligation to pay any of the money to the trustee.

d_2012nssc139.txt,"The applicant is the only drug store in a rural community. The respondent worked there for 30 years, in various positions. He signed a 5-year, 10 mile non-competition clause in 1995. He quit in early March with the intention of opening a new drug store down the street in early April. Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store. The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction. Interim injunction granted. The new Civil Procedure Rules (2008) distinguish between interim and interlocutory injunctions. This is one of the circumstances which was contemplated when the new Rule 41.04 was enacted. Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait. While the non-competition clause may well not survive a challenge at the full hearing of the interlocutory injunction motion, all the applicant needs to show is that there is a serious issue to be tried. There is. This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application. There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community. An interim injunction will only result in a delay of a few weeks. The interlocutory injunction is set to heard at the end of April. The stakes are higher for the applicant than they are for the respondent.","The plaintiff brought a motion for an interim injunction in preparation for a motion to interlocutory injunction.

Application dismissed; plaintiff to have injunction granted in place for a full interlocututory hearing; plaintiff's business threatened irreparable harm if the injunction were granted. The court found that the new business would be a'minor' business, with an estimated retail sales volume of $17 million. Although the proposed location did not have a retail component, it was nonetheless a small business and the stakes were much higher for the plaintiff's existing business. The applicant's business was already threatened by the opening date and the potential for irreparable damage. The balance of convenience favored the defendant."

e_2012skpc80.txt,The accused was charged with two counts being driving while impaired contrary to s. 253(1)(a) and refusal to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code. The Court had earlier acquitted the accused on the charge of driving while disqualified as there was no evidence regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence. At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code. The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court. There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.,"The accused was charged with three offences under the Criminal Code: impaired driving, driving while disqualified, and failure to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Code. The issue before the court was whether the accused was operating a motor vehicle as defined by the Code and whether the GiO cycle was a motor car as defined as the Code; the accused blew into the approved screening device twice, failed to provide breath sample twice and failed to supply a breath specimen three times. The accused was acquitted of the impaired driving charge. The motor vehicle offence was defined by s.253(1) of The Crown. The offence of driving while impaired was defined as defined under the Code, and the accused should be convicted of the charges of impaired driving. The second offence was failure to supply breath sample. The defence took the position that the accused had not demonstrated that the electric motor was operational at the time of the offence and that he was dragging his feet while driving the moped. HELD: The accused is guilty of the offences under s.255(1). The Crown must prove that the offence was committed while the accused's motor vehicle was operating. The first offence is driving while the Crown has a reasonable suspicion that the motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or drug. The third offence is failure to comply with a demand made by a peace officer pursuant to s253(3)(a). The second offense is failure, as the officer indicated that he observed the accused dragging his own feet while he drove the mop. The Crown has failed to prove that Rookes was operating motor vehicle on the evening of February 26, 2010. The Court finds that the Crown failed to show that the respondent's motor vehicles were operating motor vehicles as defined in the Code (except for the two offences under S.253). The Court acquittals the accused on the charges under sS.253, driving with a suspended licence and driving while over-ripe. The fourth offence is whether the respondent was operating or attempting to operate a motor motor vehicle. Hears the argument that the only reasonable ground to believe is that there were pedals on the respondent is that the Electric motor is operable. The respondent's argument that there was no physical evidence of the speed at which the respondent would have been able to pedal his bike to the next intersection is not supported by the evidence.

There was a substantial likelihood that the accused would commit a criminal offence within a year of the date they were arrested. The court ordered that the defence lawyer be released on a recognizance. The accused was in custody since November 2004. The defence lawyer had been in breach of conditions in that he was to report to the police in person, had outstanding charges and arrest warrants in Manitoba and Alberta, and had been using an alias when arrested. He was using a computer at the time of his arrest and had several outstanding warrants in both Manitoba and Manitoba. He had a significant youth court record, had been convicted in youth courts in Manitoba, and was convicted of assault causing bodily harm, possession of stolen property, and being unlawfully at large. He displayed a large amount of cocaine and methamphetamine in his possession at the Time of his Arrest in Alberta. He sold drugs to a group in Regina organized and operated by the accused. The Crown had alleged that the alleged co-conspirators were in Regina and were using an alter ego when arrested in Alberta and were wanted in Alberta for trafficking. The judge refused to release the accused for the same reasons that his release was denied. The issues are: 1) the accused's release was not subject to a release order; 2) the defence counsel was unable to accommodate the delay in filing documents; 3) the Court had no concern for the delay for various reasons and the accused had not provided a satisfactory explanation for the reason for the adjournment in the statement of motion.

e_2014skqb265.txt,The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over.08. He was acquitted of both charges. The Crown appealed the acquittals of the accused and the conviction of impaired driving. The accused argued his rights under ss. and of the Charter were violated because there were not sufficient objective grounds for the officer's suspicion. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge specifically found that the accused relied only on three factors in forming his suspicion: his nervousness, his lack of desire to tell the officer what he was doing and the fact this incident occurred at 5:12 in the morning. There was no basis for disturbing this finding of fact. The Court found that there was no evidence that the appellant had alcohol in his body at the time he was stopped by the police. The Certificate of Qualified Technician was excluded from the Certificate of Technician. The appellant appealed the s. 253(1)(b) charge and the s 253(2)(a) charge for impaired driving with blood alcohol levels over.04. The appeal court found that this was a finding of truth and there was a basis for the trial judge's finding of facts. The court also found that, in the circumstances, the appellant relied only upon three factors when forming his reasonable suspicion: the accused's nervousness and his lack thereof, his desire to inform the officer about what he had been doing and, in this incident, the fact the incident occurred in the early morning."

c_1998canlii14058.txt,"FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act. The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability. The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher. HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act. 2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver. The reasoning in Neault was directly on point. Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act. The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers. The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute. 4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer. The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.","FIAT. The question is whether the defendant is liable for s. 86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries suffered by the infant plaintiff, or whether the co-defendant is immune from liability by s. 228 of The Education Act. HELD: 1)The mother is immune by s8(1)(of the Highway Act for personal injuries caused by the child. In the event the mother is not liable, the father is not. 2)The school board is immune in the event of an accident involving a motor vehicle. The school board has the right to sue the mother for negligence caused by its own employee. 3)In the event that the mother's immunity extends to the owner of the motor vehicle, the school board can find the mother immune from negligence by s228. 4)In this case the mother was immune from damages caused by her child. The father is immune under s.228 of the Education Act unless the mother intervenes in court."
5_2004skqb417.txt,"Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999. The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month. The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000. The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley. The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school. The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000. She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return. The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income. To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding. The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years. The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2) The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922. This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources. It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount. Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income. This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376. However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424. The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410. It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003. This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952. Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.  3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345. It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support. Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.  4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003. In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes. The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003. Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so. She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.  5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract. Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed. 6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment. Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","Each party applied for a variation of the 1999 child support judgment. The 1999 judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract. The parties separated in 1997 and shortly thereafter Mr. Marzolf moved to Alberta. The plaintiff commenced negotiations in 2002 for a retroactive upward variation of child support for two children. Negotiations proceeded slowly and the plaintiff, on the basis that the respondent's income was significantly higher than the child's. On the same basis she also sought a retroactivity of support paid for both girls. The court found that child support was properly payable without interruption to June 30, 2003. Given the pattern of income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2002 that generated undisclosed cash flow and some two years later he nevertheless retains significant assets, it is reasonable to impute additional income to Mr.Marzolf for 2002. Based on the Guidelines and the information provided by her, the child support payable for two boys from January 1, 2003 to June30, 2003 of $1,186 per month and $1 for one child for each month during the balance of the year, based on the guideline amount of $150,000."
d_1998canlii4665.txt,"The primary issue in this appeal was the standard of review to be applied on appeals from a Hearing Officer to the Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal. The appellant had his appeal denied on the grounds that the decision of the Hearing Officer was not patently unreasonable. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for re-hearing, that an appeal from a Hearing Officer to the Tribunal is a statutory appeal. It is not a judicial review, and the standard of review is therefore one of correctness not whether or not the Hearing Officer's decision was patently unreasonable. The deference that the Tribunal must show is only with respect to the advantages the Hearing Officer may have in the fact finding process of a particular case.",This was an appeal for which leave was granted from a Worker's Compensation Appeals Tribunal decision. It was limited to question as to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and to the extent that the Tribunal must afford the usual appellate deference to trier of fact. This appeal was allowed and the matter was remitted to the Tribunal. There was no reason to think that the tribunal is any less expert generally in matters relating to workers' compensation that fall within s. 243(7) than the hearing officer. The concept of patently unreasonable decision had no place in this statutory appeal process. The Tribunal has made an error of jurisdiction as to its powers on an appeal from the hearing Officer.
3_1996canlii6732.txt,"The plaintiff sued his father's estate for breach of a farm lease and for the value of his farm labour. The estate counterclaimed for a mortgage debt incurred by the father on behalf of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not included in his father's Will as a beneficiary and the Will contained no reference to the mortgage debt. The father's statement of assets filed in his divorce and matrimonial property action did not disclose it as an asset. HELD: 1)The unsigned handwritten memorandum evidenced a binding agreement for lease between the plaintiff and his father. He affirmed the lease in his discussions with a daughter. 2)The plaintiff neither repudiated the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it.  The fact that he did not vigorously contest the right of his brother to farm the land on behalf of the estate did not estop him from suing for damages for his father's breach of the lease.  Damages of $6,500 were awarded. 3)The plaintiff failed to establish a quantum meruit claim. He did not produce any documents to show he had been reimbursed for his labour on the farm in prior years. Other family members helped with the farming from time to time. He did nothing while his father was alive to demand or obtain payment. 4)Even if the mortgage was considered a debt in 1989 it was subsequently forgiven. It was significant that the plaintiff was not included as a beneficiary and the amount of the mortgage was similar to the bequests to the other children. 5)The plaintiff was awarded his costs against the estate on a party and party basis for that portion of his claim on which he was successful and for defending the counterclaim. Solicitor and client costs against the estate were not appropriate as the issues raised by the claim and counterclaim were not typical estate issues. Judgment issued against the two executors in their representative capacity.","The plaintiff sues his father's estate for damages for damages caused by a breach of a farm lease and for mortgage debt incurred by the deceased on behalf of the plaintiff. The issues are: 1)Is there a valid lease agreement between the plaintiff and his deceased father? (b)If so, was the lease repudiated by the plaintiff; and 2)Is the plaintiff entitled to reimbursement from the estate on a quantum meruit basis for the value of his farm labour? (c)The plaintiff did nothing to obstruct the estate's attempts to clear his land titles prior to his death; he did nothing hoping that he would be fairly treated by the estate.  2)The issues raised by the claim and counterclaim are not typical 'estate' issues. Solicitor and client costs against the estate are not appropriate. 3)The fact the plaintiff did not vigorouslycontest the right of his brother to farm the land on behalfof the estate does not estop him from suing the estate fordamages for his breach of the lease.  4)The mortgage was not debt enforceable by the authorities. The $17,800.00 mortgage was never issued to the plaintiff until 1993. The affidavit filed by the executor and the plaintiff's sister in relation to the mortgage was also not considered by the court as a valid instrument of adjudicating on the claim. The plaintiff was not aware of the $17k800.99 when he commenced his claim for the breach of lease and was not able to produce any independent evidence to establish an understanding between his father and himself that he was to be paid for helping out on the farm. Other family members as well helped the father farm from time to time due to his ailing health and advancing age. However, they did nothing while his father was alive to demand or obtain payment."

J.A.’s mother was found to be a person of sufficient interest under s. 23 of the Act. The court ordered that the child should be placed in the custody of J.A.’s mother as a person of sufficient interest for a period of four months pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act. The child’s parents should have adequate access to build their relationship with him and to allow them, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to eventually care for their child.","The child was apprehended at birth by the Minister of Social Services but the Minister did not proceed with the application and the child was allowed to take home with her. The parents agreed that one of them would always be present to supervise the care of the child. The child had diminished cognitive abilities as she suffered from FASD and had challenges around understanding and retaining information despite presenting as though this was not the case. The mother alleged that the father had physically assaulted her and had threatened to kill anyone who entered the farm. The Minister did, however, proceed with apprehension and the infant was placed in the custody of the mother. The father was charged under The Youth Criminal Justice Act. The circumstances of the birth and the circumstances of this child were such that it was impossible for the parents to care for the child and that physical or emotional harm was likely to occur to the six week old child."
2_2006nsfc7.txt,"Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances. When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care. The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability. The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children. Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication.","The mother applied for a change in the primary care arrangements for two children. The father was currently employed as a roofer but was unable to drive a motor vehicle, having accumulated myriad of driving infractions to add to his already lengthy criminal record. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the sole care of either parent as their mother habitually smoked drugs, alcohol and drugs, had been found to be inadmissible in the father's possession and the children were exposed to daily and troublesome drug use by the father and to violent physical and verbal attacks by the children. Both parents suffered from severe mental health problems and the father was facing criminal charges for failing to provide primary care to his children. As the mother's circumstances presented a picture of a parent who was unable or unwilling to meet the needs of his children, the Court found that the joint custody arrangement was unsustainable and that if it was continued, the children would be at a greater risk of exposure to violence and mental illness by the parents and their current common-law partner. The Court also found that, in the mother’s view, primary care should not change as the children are doing fairly well and there was no public transportation to transport the children to their dental appointments and dentist appointments. Therefore, the court placed the children in the permanent care of the father."

A judgment was rendered, dividing the matrimonial property and dismissing the appellant's claim for maintenance. The appellant now appeals on the ground that the trial should not have proceeded without him. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) There is no error in the decision of the trial judge. The medical evidence did not indicate any inability to either instruct counsel or to represent him in Court. The trial judge had little choice but to do what she did. 2) The authorities cited by the appellant have no application to this case as they all deal with situations where someone did not appear at his trial. In this case, the appellant appeared but refused to participate.

b_2002nsca30.txt,"A fifteen year old died in a motor vehicle accident. The estate brought a claim for loss of future income and lost earning capacity. The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed. Appeal dismissed; the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.","Where a person is killed due to the fault of another, the person's estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in an actual pecuniary loss to the estate. The main question to be decided in this case is whether the earnings which the deceased would have likely have earned had he not been killed are 'an actual peculiary loss' and are therefore recoverable by the estate in an action against the wrongdieer. The legislature has denied such a claim to the Estate but has provided the deceased's dependants with a statutory cause of action for the lost financial support and other losses resulting from the wrongful death. Alternatively, the respondent argues that this claim is for loss of expectation of life and is not recoverable. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The survival of actions legislation contained several exclusions and limitations not found in the earlier Ontario and English legislation. The provision excluding causes of action excluding those which have not been proven by the parties is not an issue here.  2) The basic purpose of the survival of action legislation was to put the survivors of person wrongfully killed in the financial position they would have been in had he lived and continued to provide support. The appellants rely on allegedly wrongful acts of the respondent for which the respondent could have sued. If the redress under that statutory cause is thought to be inadequate, the cure must be legislative, not judicial. 3) The facts before the court are those agreed to by the Parties for the limited purpose of resolving preliminary point of law. Whether McDonald was at fault, the estate would be entitled to claim damages for Paul's lost earning capacity and are, therefore, recoverable from the estate pursuant to the survival standards of the day. 4) The common law background has been examined. The only question on this appeal is one of law, namely, whether Paul Levy's estate would claim damages under the Survival of Actions Act in respect to the deceased’s loss of earning capacity. The question posed was whether Paul’d estate has right to claim for damages under this Act. The deceased”s estate was in significantly different position than the surviving family members who were able to pursue the negligence claim to judgment while living. The living plaintiff may recover substantial non-pecuniary damages for pain and suffering and loss of opportunity and enjoyment of life. The estate of the deceased could not."

2_2007nsca122.txt,"Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas. He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision. She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here. She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned. Application for stay pending appeal dismissed; the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here. Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there. Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20.","The appellant appealed from a stay of execution of an order setting aside her divorce petition on the basis that Nova Scotia lacked jurisdiction. On the basis, she alleged that the respondent had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least 1 year prior to the filing of the petition, as required by s.3 of the Divorce Act.

An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended. The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists. The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger. Judgment for the plaintiff; there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger. There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.","The plaintiff obtained a number of open web steel joists from the respondent. The defendant proceeded to build the majority of the open web joists in the mall. The plaintiffs sued the respondent for the cost of the inspection and remediation of the mall, alleging that the respondent had failed to provide proper quality control to the occupants of the building. The respondent admitted to having fabricated the open Web steel joist, but claimed that the underlying problem was caused by the defendant's negligence. The defendants claimed that they were responsible for the majority or all of the problems identified in the open- web joist. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had not addressed the underlying issue properly and that the remedy was to have the joists deslagged. The court found that the evidence from the respondents was that the defendants had not provided proper quality monitoring and that there was a marked increase in failures over the span of a year.

The false report had been submitted to the Court for valuation of the company. HELD: 1)The testimony of the son who had worked for the respondent until fired for allegedly disclosing information to the mother was accepted over that of the respondent. 2)All assets were valued as the same time, the time of the application. The midpoint of the valuations was used to value the respondent's interest in the company at $192,727.00. 3)The petitioner was to receive the balance of the proceeds of the sale of the matrimonial home plus $13,500 to equalize for monies paid to clear off the respondent's writ of execution. 4)Any interest accrued on the sale of the matrimonial home was to be divided equally. 5)The petitioner received her automobile, RRSP and bank account. 6)She was given judgment against the respondent for $135,982.00 with a charge against the matrimonial assets to be registered at Land Titles. 7)$84,000 of the respondent's RRSP was transferred by way of spousal roll over to the petitioner. 8)$12,000 of the settlement proceeds from the wrongful dismissal claim were to be assigned and paid out to the petitioner. 9)All monies were to be paid within six months failing which the Sheriff was to proceed with the judicial sale of such of the assets of the respondent as may be required. 10)Judgment and a charge was ordered against the respondent for the outstanding property taxes in the amount of $15,428.64 which he was to have paid on or before October 1, 1993 by a previous court order. 11)Technology had passed the petitioner by and she had been economically disadvantaged to some extent from the marriage or its breakdown. She had upgraded but had been unable to secure employment. She was to receive $2,000 per month in support until the orders were satisfied and thereafter, $1,000 a month until her 60th birthday.  12)Costs were awarded to the petitioner on a solicitor-and client basis.","The parties were married 19 years. The parties had two adult children, a son and a daughter. The respondent had recently been awarded interim property rights. The petitioner sought to have her assets valued as of the date of the application. The evidence at trial indicated that the respondent had given her monies as part of his settlement offer, but that the monies owing were to be paid out within 6 months. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay the monied assets of the parties together with all the interest accruing thereon.  2)The court accepted the evidence of the respondent over the respondent when there was avariance in their evidence. 3)The parties' assets were valued as at the time of the applications. 4)The petitioner was to receive $13,500 by way of equalization for monies paid out to clear the respondent's writ of execution. 5)The appellant was to have judgment against the respondent for $135,982.

9_2008nssc58.txt,"The estate applied to have the court find that a large number of bank shares which had been gratuitously transferred by the deceased to her great niece were being held in trust for the deceased. Following discovery examinations, the great niece, who was the alternative executor appointed under the will, applied to have the executor, the deceased's husband, removed on the basis that his discovery evidence raised grave concerns about his mental capacity to continue to act as executor. Application to remove the executor dismissed; there was no medical evidence submitted in support of the applicant's claim that the executor was not competent to administer the estate and although it was clear from the discovery evidence that he did not have a clear understanding of his duties as executor, given that he was the only beneficiary under the will, he was the only person whose interest was at risk if he failed to properly administer the estate.","The applicant applied to remove the executor of the will of the deceased testator, who was the alternate executor. The deceased testor, who had difficulties with vision and hearing, and had difficulty communicating with his wife, appeared to have some recollection of certain events but had a weak grasp of other events. The applicant argued that the executors' ability to continue to act as executor had been reduced to an infirmity and that they had no understanding of how to administer the estate. The testator's sister, a niece of the testator (who had also died) was the executrix. The sister asserted that the applicant was the only person whose interest was at risk if he failed to properly administer the will, and that the application to remove an executor was dismissed. HELD: The application to removal the executrator was dismissed with costs fixed at $1,000 plus HST of 14% for disbursements payable in any event in the cause. 1)The applicant had no clear idea of what an executrator (as opposed to a person interested in the estate) was and was not entitled to. The independent executrix had no relevant medical evidence or clear understanding of the proceeding or his position as executrator. He was the sole beneficiary of the estate and had not met the testatory's primary duty of care or the duty of caring for the beneficiaries. The executor himself was the primary beneficiary and was at a significant risk of suffering from severe mental or physical infirmities. He did not have any relevant medical or mental disability. The niece's evidence that the testor had difficulty paying his legal fees and that counsel prepared the affidavit submitted in support of the show-cause application had no significance beyond this application.  2)The application to leave the executorship was dismissed as costs were fixed at the amount owing to the estate in any events in the Cause."

Section 7(2) indicates that whenever the legislature confers jurisdiction on the Court of Queen’s Bench, and is silent with respect to an appeal from that Court, an appeal lies from it. The Psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench.","This was an application by a non-practising psychologist to hear an appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench when the latter exercises jurisdiction under statute that is silent as to the right to appeal to this Court. The Psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from Queen'sBench to this court; the Psychologists act does not provide that the legislature can take away the right of appeal conferred in s. 7(2) in an enactment, providing as it does for right of appeals by the member to the Courtof Queen's Counsel only. The psychologists Act and its predecessors, dating back to The Psychologist Act, and their predecessors, and have the same wording, but it is a clear expression of legislative intent establishing the general rule that an appeal lies to the court from a Queen's bench decision and a judge of that court. HELD: The application was dismissed. The question of when right of appealed would lie to the Supreme Court lies to this Supreme Court, unless an enactment 'confers only a limited right of Appeal' (SSDC). 1) The Psychology Act does nothing more than a further expression of the law that confers a legislative will to the contrary in any other enactment. The psychologist Act does, however, state that a right of view lies to be had in Queen's Park when the legislature confers jurisdiction on Queen's B Bench or a judge thereof. 2) The psychologist Act does no mention of the right for appeal to the Queen's herself. The Court of Appeal Act does so. The Psychologyologists Act only tangentially concern the question of whether the phrase 'conferences only a general right of appealing' is satisfied when no right of appellant is provided in the other enactment, but that does not limit the member's right of return to this one. 3) The Court was unable to draw a distinction between professional and amateur statutes. The conclusion of the court's inquiry was that the Psychologist act and its predecessor, The Interpretation Act, 2000, and its successors, dating in s7(2)(a) and their predecessor, respectively, did not state the right OF appeal to be found in Queen’s Bench only."

2006skqb536.txt,"The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf. The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction. The defendant, Ritchie Bros., declared its guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the Contract to Auction which charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds of sale. The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services. The plaintiff was first approached to become a potential customer. In the transitional period, the contractual negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendants generated two standard form agreements, a preliminary 'LeBlanc' contract dated December 2003 and a subsequent 'Ritchie Bros.' contract dated March 28 2004. These documents raised issues of breach of contract insofar as the plaintiff's alleged failure to refurbish equipment and to adequately prepare the auction site in advance of the sale. HELD: 1) The plaintiff did not feel inescapably bound to contract with the defendants. The defendants proceeded to advertise the sale extensively, taking out ads in three provinces and in the northern United States, preparing thousands of catalogues for mass distribution, and directly delivering 1,500 posters to farm yards and mail boxes in Melfort and area. 2) In the interim, the plaintiff consigned his goods for sale to the highest bidder and was not prepared to part with any of the equipment or to bid on it. The contract between the parties was never finalized. The documents were all signed by the plaintiff. 3) There were no explicit agreements between the vendors. The parties clearly communicated to each other that the goods would be sold unreserved to the next highest bidder. 4) The contractual provisions of each party were never disclosed to the other. The court found that the plaintiff was not entitled to any input into the specifications of the auctioneer or to the defendants for the purpose of assigning the bid. The agreement was never signed by any of them. The plaintiffs were not required to participate in the auction. 5) The court was not satisfied that the contractual provisions in the June 2003 agreement could not be considered part of the contract between parties. The wording of the June 2004 agreement could only be interpreted as meaning that the agreement could be interpreted to mean that the parties had agreed to a termination of the agreement. 6) The documents in question cannot comprise the agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendant. The Act states the sale can be treated as fraudulent by the buyer, and fraud will void the sale if the proceeds of the sales are not realized. The claim that the defendants had 'used the plaintiff as a bargaining partner' is not supported by the Act. The Court found that"
7_1997canlii11172.txt,"An application pursuant to s232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for a determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada had sought disclosure. The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors. The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions. The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm. At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties. HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld. 2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction. One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.  3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor. Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency. 7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery. They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants. 8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice. Notes prepared by the accountant and the interoffice communications summarizing discussions with the solicitor also fell within the scope of privilege.","An application for determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada has sought disclosure. The corporate applicants were husband, wife, accountant and two adult sons who were principal shareholders and directors. The husband and wife sought solicitor-to-client communications, which the accountant was acting as representative for the purpose of seeking legal advice from the applicants. The son's role in relation to the subsequent communication was clearly as a representative of the accountant's role and was to convey the accountant intricacies of his situation which he may not himself be competent to explain. The accountant's position was that he was acting only as agent or representative of his client and not as a person. The evidence showed that both the husband and the wife were prepared to disclose those documents which fell into the third category, namely communications with and with the accountant. HELD: 1)Solicitor-client privileged communications extend beyond the confines of the corporate communications. The central issue is whether and to what extent solicitor- client privilege applies to documents prepared by third parties in this case, the clients' accountants. 2)The accountant's privileged communications with the applicants were for the purposes of obtaining legal advice. 3)Theater privilege extended to communications between the husband's accountant and the clients of the accounting firm. The parties were communicating in a confidential capacity on behalf of the husband. The wife's privileged communication with the husband was for the sole purpose of obtaining tax advice. 4)The husband's privileged privileged communications were for purposes of getting legal advice and were not related to the accountant or the son's privileged relationship with the accounting company. The personal relationship was not incidental to the communications. 5)The parties were acting as agents for the husband in relation the communications between them. The father's privileged privilege extended beyond the corporate communication to include any correspondence between himself and the husband with regard to tax matters. The lawyer's privileged access was limited to the contents of a letter or a document sent to the husband by the wife to the wife. The solicitor's privileged contact with the wife was limited by the husband to only those matters discussed in the wife's brief.  6)The wife's privilege was extended to include all documents prepared or obtained by the accountant for the specific purpose of communicating with the client. 7)The lawyer's privilege extended from communications between husband and son for the express purpose of requesting legal advice or assistance from the husband, to communications with his wife and children for the intended purpose of reaching the husband"
4_2016skqb160.txt,"Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat. The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence. The accused was found guilty as charged.","The accused was charged with assault and threatening to use a weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The evidence presented at trial was that the accused had armed himself with a knife when he confronted the victim, who was a member of the police force. The accused had been chased by the victim's vehicle, chased by vehicle, and slashed the tire on his vehicle. The victim, now 46, was the primary victim of the confrontation. The Crown called five witnesses who gave evidence at trial. HELD: The accused was found guilty of assault and acquitted of all charges. The Court held that the nature of the force or threat that was presented by the size of the accused and the words used by the accused were not of a nature that would warrant, as reasonable, the action taken by the defendant against the victim. The court had concluded that the actions of the defence witness in this case were not reasonable in the circumstances and did not constitute lawful protection of self-defence. The actions of defence witness on the stand were completely out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat that the defendant may have perceived was made or presented by him in the circumstance.

1998canlii13596.txt,"Administrative Law - Judicial Review - Bias/Institutional BiasAdministrative Law - Medical Care Insurance - Medical Fees - Repayment - AppealProfessions and Occupations - Physicians and Surgeons - Cardiologist - Medical Fees_____ A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB). Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue. There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented. 3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence. The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data. The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects. He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours. 4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76.

HELD: 1)The Committee failed to provide adequate reasons for its decision. 2)The committee was mandated under the Act to determine whether the cardiologist's pattern of medical practice was acceptable to it considering that his billings to medicare were out of line with the billings made by the other cardiologists in the province.

5_2006nssc353.txt,"The claimant flooring dealer had supplied and installed a large amount of flooring in the defendant's new home. Although the defendant had visited the claimant's store and selected the flooring, the actual purchase was made by the defendant's contractor who did not pay the claimant and had now declared bankruptcy. The adjudicator found that although the three criteria for an unjust enrichment claim had been met, there was no special relationship between the parties and thus, denied the claim. The claimant appealed. Appeal allowed; the absence of a special relationship will not automatically defeat a claim of unjust enrichment; the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment claims.","During the construction of Dr. Paul Joseph's home by the respondent company, which contracted for flooring material from the appellant company, the respondent contracted for the material as well as its subcontractors. There was no direct contact between the appellant and the defendant, and the purchasing of all the material was left up to the flooring manager who dealt with the appellant under the direction of the respondent. The goods were invoiced to Maritime and delivered to the respondent's home. The appellant was not paid for the floor materials. The respondent was not awarded its costs. The appeal against the respondent and the Small Claims Court is allowed. The trial judge did find that the trial judge had the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment and the absence of a special relationship will not necessarily defeat a claim."
8_2005skca120.txt,"The deceased made a Will appointing her only son, the appellant, as executor. In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents. The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly. She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000. After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself. He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will. The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him. He appeals against that judgment. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.  1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2) The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust. The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren. She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact. Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate. In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust. In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis. Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate. 3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error.  4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren. The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased. The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him. The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee. The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence","The appellant executor of a will (who died in 1999) took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the will but were given to him for the benefit of his relatives and grandchildren. The residuary beneficiaries brought an action against the appellant claiming that the funds were a part of the residue of the estate and sought a judgment for the amounts they, the beneficiaries, should have received. This appeal was against that judgment. The trial judge found as fact that the appellant intended the RRI to benefit his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He did not mention in his evidence that the deceased intended to give the funds to his relatives. The evidence suggested that the recipient intended to express a trust in favour of her grandchildren and grandchildren. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in law in that the respondent intended the funds in question to go to the appellant for the purposes of the trust established in the will. He asked if he was unsuccessful on his first two points that this Court grant him relief under s.57 of The Trustee Act, R.S.S., in respect of the deceased's trust in the estate. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)The trial judge did not err in law. The fact that there was no gift to the deceased and no trust in favor of her grandchildren, the monies must, of necessity, revert to the estate, and the trial court found that the findings of fact made in the evidence supported by the evidence did not prejudge the decision. 2)The appellant did not intend to give any of the funds back to the respondent. The respondent intended to distribute the funds among her grandchildren. 3)The standard of review in respect the issues here is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error. It is trite law that judge can accept part of evidence of a witness and reject another part. It was open to the trial judges to arrive at a finding of fact as to the intentions of the appellant. It would not be appropriate to require the trial officer to make any inquiry into the reasons for the decision he made. The circumstances simply did not justify compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence.  4)The appellants appealed. Appeal dismissed with costs under Double Column V in the usual way."

2_2007nssc235.txt,"The parties, divorced, had children, aged 23, 19, and 14 years, respectively. The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support. The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment. The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed. Both parties applied to vary child support. The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school. Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses. The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies. The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months. Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years. The father will pay 25 per cent of the core university costs which are not covered by the plan for the middle child as well as the difference in the Table amount of support for two children versus one child; the father shall pay the Table amount of support for one child to the wife for the youngest child as well as that child's expenses for private school; the wife will be responsible for any extra-curricular activities or tutoring outside the private school; the youngest child will be entitled to the same post-secondary benefits in the same fashion as the two older children; the CRJ is amended to provide that the two oldest children are in the joint care of their parents and will not include any other reference to custody or access; the husband is entitled to specified block access with the youngest child; if flight arrangements are made for this child and she does not fly (and there is no medical reason confirmed in writing by a doctor for that failure), the husband's block access shall be expanded for one week at the next access period and the cost of any penalty from the missed flight will be deducted dollar for dollar from the child support payable by the husband.","The parties brought a variation application under the Divorce Act in 2005. The application related primarily to the issues of spousal support, child support and access. The Corollary Relief Judgment provided that the husband would pay $3,100 per month in child support for the three children of the marriage until the age of 23, when the support order was cancelled. The requirement for the husband to pay William's educational expenses was conditional upon the wife obtaining employment. The evidence showed that the children had been active achievers since the divorce and that their spousals were reduced prior to this date due to changes in circumstances. The husband argued that the change in circumstances related to the marriage would require a change in the children's ability to pay their own wayward expenses. Application to vary spousa support dismissed. The parties made a series of cross-applications concerning child support. The oldest child, born in September 2003, was 23. The youngest child, who was approaching 14, was in the mother's custody. The mother's application to vary child support was discontinued in June 2002. The father was ordered to pay $592 per month for the two children, $2,958 per month, and $2 million in 2008. The amount of support payable to the mother was reduced to $592 based on the Corollaries Relief Judgment. The 2008 child support would be adjusted according to the same rate as the one made in the Corolla Relief Judgment, 2005."
8_2013skqb403.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it. It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable. The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective. In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex; and 4) that there was no evidence that the board based its decision on irrelevant considerations such as the potential political ramifications of paying for medical marijuana.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The Board's decision to deny reimbursement was reasonable and within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes. There was no evidence that the Board erred in determining that medical marijuana was not necessary or required for the pain relief sought. The board's decision was within the scope of the possible acceptable outcomes and was within range of reasonable outcomes. 1)The Board's interpretation that the Act granted the Board discretion to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment is reasonable. Even if Policy Statement is ultra vires, it does not decide this matter. It is not necessary to decide whether Policy Statement 5 is ultra-vires. 2)There was no suggestion that the board erred on the side of reasonableness. The evidence suggested that medical marihuana was not proven and therefore not necessary. The use of the word'shall' in s. 106(1) requires the Board to provide medical aid to injured employees. On the face of its reasons, the Board denied reimbursement specifically because medical marijuana is potentially unsafe and unproven. The studies did not definitively state that medical guihuana is effective. The respondent states that the Court reviewed the Board's decisions. The Court was of the view that the interpretation that Board had in place regarding the reimbursement of medical marijuana (as opposed to medical marijuana) was reasonable. The decision to decline reimbursement on the basis that medical cannabis is not proven or required is reasonable and is not the only reasonable interpretation of the Act. The applicant argues that the wording of the Board’s decision was found to be ultra viring. 3)The board did not rely on Policy Statement five or even mention it in its decision. The Review Board was required to interpret its own statute with which it is familiar. The approach to interpreting legislation is that of reason and correctness. The court found that the respondent was required in Mellor v. Saskatchewan (the respondent states it had exclusive jurisdiction granted to it under s. 22(1). The Board found that it had the power to create POL 10/2011 as an exercise of the exclusive jurisdiction conferred under s22(1)(a). The respondent was awarded the decision."
e_2009skpc9.txt,"The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants. The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions.","The plaintiffs claim $6,700.77 against the defendant for water damage sustained while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin, Saskatchewan in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendant.

Whether the Plaintiffs are pre-cluded from recovering against the defendants by virtueof the contractual terms acknowledging the Equipment is Water-Resistant and not Waterproof and the posted warranties to this affect. 1) Quantum of damages and mitigation. Hears from the evidence that the damage was caused when the defendant entered the rental unit in heavy rain.

The damage is extensive and can be traced back to the time the equipment rented was not waterproof. The Court cannot be sure that the decals on the truck would have been seen when he loaded it, but it is certain that they were. The court cannot be certain that the signage on the trucks was accurate. The decals in the truck could not have been drawn to the extent that this could have been a potential problem in leaving it sit for two extra days.

He was given credit for 22 months spent in custody. Matychuk was sentenced to 12 years in prison but was given credit for time in custody on a 1:1 basis because the Court had not found any circumstances to justify any greater amount of credit. Matychuk’s credit was for 19 months. The sentences were based on the circumstances of the offence: a home invasion and inflicting serious bodily harm on a young victim. The assault was violent and degrading and took place over a period of time. Weapons were used while the victim was bound and sexually assaulted and threatened.,"HELD: The accused was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The court found that the court found the facts to support the conviction. The accused had a lengthy criminal record, most of which relate to thefts and break and enters. The offences were committed while he was a student at the University of Regina. The complainant had a previous criminal record as a result of the 1992 theft, most relating to thefts. The assault victim had a large tear in his rectum which went deep in the pelvis. The complainants smashed the television in the complainant's home and left the complainant on the floor.

In so doing, it asked that its solicitor, Mr. Hesje, be appointed as selling officer to conduct the sale and report to the Court. The court expressed its concern to Mr. Hesje during the course of his submissions as to the propriety of the applicant solicitor serving in such a dual function. He informed the court that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined. In the court's respectful view, it is not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor. There are obvious difficulties with conflict of interest. Who does the selling officer serve: the Court, from which his or her authority originates; or the client? The matter is of sufficient importance that the court concluded it should reduce its thoughts to a fiat and direct that it be distributed to other members of the Court.

e_2016skpc157.txt,"HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice. The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately.

The court found that the reasonable suspicion standard was low and having regard to the evidence and the existing law, that threshold has been met. The police officer's explanation for not being able to leave the scene till some time after 5:36 a.m. was not satisfactory. The delay may have prejudiced the accused. The need to take the tests as soon as practicable is to ensure that the accused's blood alcohol content was as accurate as possible at the time of driving.

d_2004nssf15.txt,"The parties were married for 10 years. Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home.

Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile. The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year. Although the wife did not establish any disadvantage from the marriage, there were disadvantages relating to its breakdown and her lifestyle deteriorated as result of the marriage ending.","The parties were married for ten years and had entered into a separation agreement in 2001. The husband petitioned for divorce in June 2003. The wife subsequently filed an Answer, which prompted the husband to pay spousal support for an indefinite period. The issues were: 1) spousals; 2) the allegation that the husband failed to comply with the Separation Agreement requiring her to provide him with an automobile; and 3) the wife's allegation that he failed to provide her with an auto. HELD: 1). The husband was entitled to spousousal in the amount of $1,000 per month for a period of 15 months from April 2004 unless, prior to this termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousalin support should continue.  2) The husband is entitled to $1k per month retroactive to the date he ceased paying it. 3) The wife has established an entitlement to spOUSAL support for indefinite periods. The Court cannot find that the evidence supports a conclusion it was agreed to be only for one year. 4) The evidence supports the conclusion it will be longer than it was previously. 5) The obligation to pay monthly spousa support is for an unspecified period of time and should be discontinued in accordance with the Divorce Act. The requirement to have a vehicle insured by the husband is reviewable by the parties. The obligation for spousy support to continue for longer periods is not satisfied by the Court's finding that it is necessary to address the significant personal issues that are related to the husband's financial affairs. The individual's ability to pay should not be limited to just one year, but rather to several years.

The Queen's Bench Act 1998 order directed the parents to complete the parent education program and file a certificate of completion within sixty days. Costs will remain in the cause. The first issue on the father’s application was that he had deliberately denied access and intentionally refused to comply with the access provisions contained in paragraph 4(d) of the Judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice J.R.O. Archambault. Hearsay words were exchanged between the father, the mother and the court. The court cannot ignore the best interests of the child and neither fine nor imprisonment should be ordered unless consistent with those best interests. The additional sanction now sought is of dubious merit. The law regarding contempt is not one of those grey areas. Although the father was granted custody, the court could not ignore the interests of his child and did not order fine or imprisonment unless consistent WITH those best intentions. The primary issue on this application was the mother’ s refusal to cooperate with the father in exercising access. The Court was unable to ignore the child’S genuine motivation and expressed sympathy for him."
d_2017skqb42.txt,"HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages.",HELD: The court found that the defendant was guilty of defamation as long as he was in the know about the facts and did what he was told. The court did not find that the defendants were liable in defamation as the article published in the Star Phoenix was part of a series of fair and accurate contemporaneous reporting by the defendants that were the basis of the defendants' defamation claim. The defendants opposed the application to add the defendant as a defendant on the basis that the two-year limitation period set forth in The Limitations Act in force at the time of the alleged defamation had expired. The plaintiff had already commenced a lawsuit against the defendants alleging that they had published defamatory comments about the defendant. The defendant was aware of the existence of the claim in the Sun and the StarPhoenix and he had been in contact with the plaintiffs' counsel prior to the publication of these articles. The issues were whether the statement of claim should be amended to add Postmedia Network Inc. as a sidekick to the defendants and whether the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction requiring the defendants to remove certain content from websites under their control.
e_2014skqb344.txt,"The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi. It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price. Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000. If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs. Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff. Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application. All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful.","The plaintiff applied for an order nisi for judicial sale of the property owned by the defendants. The Limitation of Civil Rights Act does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not a purchase-money mortgage. However, a judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency set by the court, otherwise, as provided by s. of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt. The plaintiff applied by notice of application for the order nisisi for a judicial sales, with service upon both defendants. Neither appeared in court. The draft order sets out the proposal for disbursing the purchase monies. The proposed selling officer ought not to be the plaintiff's own counsel."
3_2000skqb579.txt,"FIAT. The numbered company applied for relief pursuant to the Queen's Bench Act s.81(1) allowing the court to direct the judgment to be paid by installments. The creditor objected that the applicant had plenty of opportunity over the years to pay and drew attention to prior allegations of mismanagement or redirection of funds which should have been allocated to the payment of interest. HELD: The payment which should have been paid in November was to be paid within 7 days. The remaining payments set out in the schedule will commence January 2001 with the change in rate of interest from that provided under the Interest Act to one equivalent to pre-judgment interest. A 5 day grace period was allowed after which the respondent was allowed to proceed immediately with enforcement by execution, garnishment or any means it deems appropriate. The taxed cost of this application was added to the judgment and will be part of the balance to be paid on May 1, 2001. Counsel could apply for further directions.","FIAT. 598772 applied for relief pursuant to Queen's Bench Act s. 81(1) of 1998. That allows the Court to direct that a judgment will be paid by instalments and/or over a period of time where it is demonstrated that the judgment debtor requires such relief. HELD: The judgment was granted. It will be granted on the basis outlined in the proposed settlement commencing with a payment to be made within 7 days which would have been paid November 1, 2000. The remaining payments set out in the schedule will follow thereafter continuing with January 1, 2001. An officer of the applicant swore that the officers were prepared to infuse $100,000 into the company's treasury if need be to make up any shortfall from funds needed by the company to pay the instalmentments. In the absence of formal commitment on their part to do so, the Court cannot take that into consideration.  1)The judgment will provide for the instals suggested in the schedules but with the addition of the rate of interest of interest which should be equivalent to pre-judgment interest and should continue until the judgment was satisfied in full. 2)The court reviewed all of the circumstances and the relatively short time in which it was proposed the judgment be granted. The judgment will cover the period from November 1 to January 1/2001. 3)The judge awarded the judgment on the recommendation of the parties. The court reviewed the circumstances, the relatively time inwhich it was suggested the judgment should be proposed. The rate ofinterest to be paid on the judgment commencing at the date of the proposed settlements was equivalent to the pre-judicial interest provided for under the Interest Act, R.S.C. 1985. 4)The remaining payments were to follow thereafter."
8_2014skqb299.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness. Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly. Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public. The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past. The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout. To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn. The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable.","The parties disagreed on the standard of review to be applied to the arbitrator's interpretation of s. 51 of the Act. The University's position was that the president's personal recommendation to the Board was not required, and the Board's power to follow the president’s recommendation did not fall within the scope of the Agreement. The Arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction, made an unreasonable decision, or committed an otherwise reviewable error of law by misinterpreting sections of the University Act and in particular s. 52. 2. The interpretation of the s.51 by the arbitrators was not correctness or reasonableness. Both parties relied on the Rucker decision, which held that the President’d recommendation to appoint a probationary assistant professor was not mandatory, and that the Board had not been obliged to follow their president”s recommendation. HELD: The dispute was decided on the basis of Rucker’ s. 45 decision and the interpretation of ss. 51 and 51. 2 of the Saskatchewan Act.  1) The Act hardly uses the term tenure at all and not directly in this context. The existence of s.(3)(b) makes it more difficult to conclude the President's authority should be personal and unfettered, and in my view more reasonable to conclude that it is power to be exercised within parameters set by the Board, which includes collective bargaining. 2) The Arbitrators found after reviewing The University of Saskatchewan Act, 1995, S. 6.1 (the Act) and the Tenure Appeals Committee decision as if the same had been transmitted to them by the president in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The results of the arbitration were appealed. 3) The parties agreed to a lengthy statement of facts and the admissibility of number of documents."
9_2005skca89.txt,"This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act. The couple had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property. The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents. The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced. By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000. 2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property. There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act. On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property. The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage. Minority: 1) The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act. The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together. In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2) The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents. He made a finding the loans were statute-barred. The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent. He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid. He simply used less than precise language.","This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, initiated by Deborah Ruskin, a nurse, against Leith Dewar, a doctor. The two had lived together for several years and she sought judgment distributing their property or its value equally between them. The trial judge held that the parties had become'spouses' within the meaning of the Act in early June 1994 and then held that Ms. Ruskin was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gift or loans. With that appeal, Dr. Dewar appealed. Appeal allowed. The evidence before the trial judge was that the value of the Vancouver property was exempt from distribution because it was acquired after the commencement of spousal relationship, not before? Alternatively, he contended the gift and loans served to reduce the value available for distribution. HELD: Appeal allowed in part. 1) The trial court erred in finding that the values of the parties, or their value, fell to be taken into account in the distribution of the family property rather than before. The value of a house in Saskatchewan is not exempt from distributing because it is acquired prior to the commencement spousa relationship. It follows that the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Family Property Maintenance Act.  2) The parties cohabitated with one another continuously for 2 years. There the matter was governed by s. 22 of the ACT having regard for the equitable considerations mentioned in s. 21 and 23 of the act. The fact that the evidence is sufficiently supported by the evidence as to preclude interference is enough to preclude the application of s.23. Harker v. Hlynski (1999), 176 D. L.R. 1 (4th) 132 (Sask. C.A.)."
4_2011skpc127.txt,"The Ministry brought an application for a permanent order for the child pursuant to s. 37 of The Child and Family Services Act. The Minister apprehended the child at birth. The mother's three older children had been apprehended with two other older children placed with a person of sufficient interest and the third child was made a permanent ward of the Ministry. The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child. The mother and the child's father had separated with the father supporting the mother having the child returned to her care and the father having access to the child. HELD: There was no basis for the initial apprehension as the child was not in need of protection. The child shall be returned to the mother who is a person who has a right of custody of the child pursuant to s. 36(3) of the Child and Family Services Act. This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry with the child to be completely returned to the mother within 30 days of this order. There was no evidence presented at trial regarding attempts by the Ministry to pursue any less intrusive alternatives and instead proceeded directly to the most severe position being a permanent order. The evidence did not justify the Ministry's position.","The Ministry brings an application for a permanent order for the child, born April 19, 2010, pursuant to s. 37 of The Child and Family Services Act. The biological parents, M.S. and P.K., oppose the application and submit the child should be returned to the mother. HELD: 1) The child is in need of protection pursuant to ss. 37(1) and s. 11 of the Act.  2) The burden is on the Ministry to establish its case on the balance of probabilities being the civil burden of proof. 3) The children have been placed into the temporary custody of the Minister, and the parents wish to have the children returned to them, they must make efforts to improve or remove the conditions or circumstances in the home which have resulted in the children being taken from the parents. 4) Two of the children have suffered physical or emotional harm, which is unlikely an adoption plan would be made if the child were permanently committed to the Minister. P.S.'s behaviour is unacceptable and inexactitude is demonstrated by the fact that he has passed gas and had an erection during the visit."
1993canlii3174.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards. The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children. Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home. The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal. The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final. Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order, that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected. There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision. The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases. To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties. Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period. The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","The parties were married for 56 years. There were three children of the marriage. The wife, who had recently remarried, continued to reside in the matrimonial home. The parties had signed a settlement agreement in 1983 which provided for the termination of maintenance payments. The husband, now 57, and the wife, 56, had been unable to work hard and as a result, sought to vary the amount of maintenance paid. They had both received substantial amounts of government support (approximately $8,000 per month). The wife had been unsuccessful in her attempts to obtain employment and the husband, who now owned an insurance business, applied to vary his support to $1200 per month. Dismissing the appeal, that where there has been a radical change in the circumstances, the parties' agreement had not been in breach of the previous relationship. The fact that the husband's income had declined in the past few years did not constitute a radical departure from the previous years, and there was no evidence that his deteriorating financial circumstances were the result of the agreement's termination."
c_2016skqb293.txt,"HELD: The appeal was granted on the basis of the first two grounds as well as others. The court quashed the tribunal’s decision and reinstated the appellant’s hospital privileges. The court reviewed the transcript of the tribunal’s hearing and its written decision. With regard to the first two issues, it found that the tribunal had erred in law in the following ways: 1) by failing to conduct a de novo hearing as required. It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision. It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent. It merely accepted the evidence of the SMO’s experts.","HELD: The appeal was granted. The decision of the Practitioner Staff Appeals Tribunal was reviewed and the errors that led to the granting of a remedy to the appellant were in accord with s. 45(3) of the Act. The Tribunal did not err in any respects and that the errors led to a granting of the appellant's remedy to him, that of quashing the Tribunal's decision and full reinstatement of his privileges. The evidence from the Board and Tribunal was that all of the possible treatment options were reviewed with the respondent, who elected to pursue a particular course of treatment. The respondent had various Bylaws, including the one relating to the patient's right to a termination of her privileges. This decision was based on the respondent's own evidence and was not made lightly."
2_2007skqb378.txt,"The outstanding issue is child support, past and future. The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent is a farmer. His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made. The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment. However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose. It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income. In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support. The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%. An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added. The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528. As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe. This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused. The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally. It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now. 3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support. The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable. 3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access. She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.  4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","The parties have three children, three of which are now with the respondent. The parties resided with their respective parents on alternate weeks. In 2004 the petitioner moved with the three children to Alberta. In 2005 the three youngest children moved with her. In 2006 the respondent paid child support but made no payment for the month of June. The petitioner now sought to be compensated for lost wages and the cost of fuel. HELD: 1) The capital cost allowance is an ordinary, and not extraordinary, expenses and would be encompassed in the basic child support. 2) The respondent was awarded one-half of the amount owing. The court accepted the respondent's failure to take into account the petitioner's personal circumstances and to ensure the safety of the children. 3) The petitioner knew the costs of the trip would vary and she did so unilaterally and on her own initiative. It would be inappropriate to now compel the respondent to contribute when he earlier expressed a contrary position. The respondent's conduct here is clearly wrong. 4) The fees are ordinary, not extraordinary expenses and should be encompassing in the support. The Court found that the respondent should have paid one-third of the sum owing."
c_2014skqb144.txt,The Court dismissed the application. It found that the accused was not capable of representing himself but that the accused had not shown that he was indigent.,"The accused is charged with possession of a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was committed to stand trial on the noted offence of trafficking. At the preliminary hearing, the accused failed to complete any of the steps outlined in the order for his defence and had not made any attempt to obtain financing. He applies for court appointed counsel. The application for court- appointed counsel is dismissed. The accused has not made an effort to obtain the necessary financing or to secure the necessary equipment for his own defence. The Court assesses the accused's ability to pay legal fees on his own and the Court makes an order appointing counsel. It then assesses whether the accused has the financial resources to do so. The court finds that the accused is indigent and only if the accused makes an effort, which he has not. The Rowbotham protocol is applicable to all accused. It is clear from the information and material that the Court assesss the accused’s ability to raise funds for his legal fees by considering the complexity of the legal issues involved in the charge, charges, and possible sentence to be imposed. The information and materials on the application before the Court show that the most indigent of accused is probably not capable of conducting his own defense in light of the personal issues that he is facing and his methamphetamine addiction. The fact that the defence lawyer has not been appointed by the Court to represent him at his trial weighs in favour of the accused."

At the end of the review they were to provide a written report to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer. The hospital staff participating in the investigation and review were advised that their information would be treated as part of a 'peer review' and therefore confidential. Upon receipt of the report the hospital, as a result, refused to disclose the report to the families. An application pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was made by an M.L.A., who sought for the disclosure of the report and for a review of the hospital's decision to not release the report. The hospital decided to release the full report. The appellant employees appealed the decision of the hospital, claiming that they had been assured confidentiality. Allowing the appeal, that the disclosure of personal information consisting of personal recommendations or evaluations, character references, or personal evaluations by the appellants and other hospital staff are presumed under s. 20(3)(g) of the Act to be an unreasonable invasion of a third party's personal privacy. Under s. 20(1) the hospital is required to refuse to disclose this information. It necessarily follows that recommendations in the report founded upon such information is also presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy and is likewise not to be disclosed. The remainder of the report is disclose able.","The appellants sought a judgment in respect to a peer review of three individuals who had committed suicide. The decision was made against the recommendations of senior management at the hospital and contrary to assurances given to the families that they would not be receiving the report. The authors of a report were approached by the hospital staff and assured that it was to be a confidential document which would be used as an internal document only, thus ensuring the confidentiality of their participation. The hospital refused to release the report and, after several days of examination, the decision was overturned. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the admission of the individuals' records was a serious concern to the hospital, and would violate the confidentiality provisions of the Act.

8_2017skqb53.txt,"The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography. The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused.

The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history.",HELD: The application was granted in part and the balance of evidence found in the evidence was excluded. The court found that the accused had not provided evidence as requested and that there was insufficient evidence to support the exclusion of evidence. The evidence found through the Internet search was inadmissible and was not part of the evidence at trial. The accused's s. 8 Charter rights had been violated as a result of the search. The Court found that it was reasonable and inadmissible to exclude evidence found during the course of the trial that was otherwise relevant to the purpose of the investigation. The exclusion of the information from the evidence pending trial was a reasonable and just remedy to ensure the accused's continued right of appeal.
e_1999skqb150.txt,"FIAT. It was held in an earlier fiat in June that the addition of the two proposed plaintiffs asserted new causes of action and amendments to the statement of claim could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act. The defendant resisted the joinder of the new plaintiffs and amendments on the basis of undue delay and actual prejudice. The statement of claim alleged nuisance, and in the alternative, negligence against the City with respect to the design, construction and maintenance of the sewer system causing his basement to flood. The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time. Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied. The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes. HELD: The amendments were allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The facts were uncertain. It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced. If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period. 2)Inexcusable delay was not established. 3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice. If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction. No evidence had been lost. The basement was available for inspection. It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants. 4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments. The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice. It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff. It appeared that the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendment was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued and arose out of the same occurrence. 4)Costs in the cause.","FIAT. The proposed plaintiffs applied to set aside proposed amendments to the original statement of claim and the joinder of parties to that claim. In the end, the Court held the amendments did not require leave to amend and that the infant could be joined as a plaintiff on the basis she was an infant against whom the limitation period for the Urban Municipality Act had intervened. The Court also held that the amendments could be brought as an application under s. 44(11) of The Queen's Bench Act as amended. HELD: The application was allowed. The defendant resisted the joinders of the original plaintiffs and the amendments to statement of claims on the grounds of undue delay on the part of the proposed plaintiffs and actual prejudice to the defendant. The application is allowed. 1) The limitation period in s. 314(1) applies from the time when the damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The material filed does not establish inexcusable delay and actual bias. 2) The Court noted that the limitation time for applications under s44(11)(a) of the Queen'sBench Act is 6 years. As there is no legal impediment to making the amendments requested, it is an appropriate exercise of judicial discretion to allow the amendments request. As the limitation periods for the application under the new legislation are 6 years, the application is dismissed. 3) The applicant was not prejudiced, it was merely its own inaction which prevented it from considering amendments that would have been considered under the Queen’s Bench Act. 4) The plaintiff was not the only party prejudiced as it was not aware that damages would increase, the same argument is available to the applicants. No evidence has been lost. Any consultant hired by the defendant is in an equally good position to investigate as was the applicants’ consultant and offer an opinion on cause and remedy."
e_1996canlii6831.txt,"The petitioner sought a divorce, custody, spousal and child support and an unequal division of matrimonial property. The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order. Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children. Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job. It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support. 2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence. She suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown. 3)The car owned by the petitioner when she married was exempt property. The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value. The list prepared by the respondent was used to divide household goods, tools and equipment. 4)The respondent was to assume one-half of the bank loan and it was agreed that the pension funds should be shared equally. 5)It would be unfair and inequitable to the custodial parent to order an equal division of the matrimonial property. The petitioner was granted possession of the matrimonial home until the younger child's 18th birthday or until she vacated the property. 6)The respondent cannot avoid his responsibility of providing an adequate level of support by turning his back on well-paid employment. Spousal and child support were deducted from his share of the matrimonial home. The petitioner was given leave to return to Court after February 28, 1999 for reconsideration of child support.","The petitioner sought a divorce, custody of the children, spousal and child support and an unequal division of matrimonial property. The respondent's ex-wife applied for an order for joint custody of their matrimonial property, which had been held by the petitioner since their separation in 1994. The petitioner was granted exclusive possession of the matrimony home and interim custody of its children. The parties' relationship was already strained by the marriage and there was considerable division of time. The single unusual circumstance in this case was the extent of the respondent's assets, considering that she was only 24 years old when she married him. This did not constitute an extraordinary circumstance within the meaning of the Act. HELD: 1)The respondent was ordered to pay spousals of $1,400 per month until February 1999. 2)He was to pay child support of $2,600 per month for 3 years. 3)The petitioner's pre-trial motion was dismissed. 4)The parties had entered into an agreement to share the matrononial home and household goods.  5)The Court was not able to determine the fair market value of the household goods, tools and equipment as it was not reasonable to expect them to exist in the circumstances. 6)The evidence showed that the respondent had taken a leave of absence from his employment to pursue a career in the construction industry. The wife was not seeking employment. The husband's income had dropped from over $4,000 to less than $1k,000. The Court could not find that the value of their home had increased during the marriage."
e_2016skpc106.txt,"HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence.",HELD: The accused was found not guilty of assault. The evidence that was obtained following the unlawful entry into the accused's apartment was excluded. The court found that the accused did not have any lawful authority to enter the complainant’s apartment and that she had no reason to apprehend the father of the children. The Court concluded that the mother did not possess a valid or enforceable warrant to enter her home and that the father did not intend to apprehend her children. It was concluded that she did not Have any lawful Authority to enter Ms. Bigsky’ s apartment and therefore there was no reason for the apprehension.
e_2009nssm47.txt,"The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property. The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend. As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial.","The defendant farmer was a friend of the plaintiff farmer and was allegedly involved in a tree cutting operation for the defendant farmer. The two properties abut back to back and the plaintiff farmers both had properties abuts back to each other. The defendant farmer cut down trees on the plaintiff's property by mistake and offered to pay the plaintiff for removal. The plaintiff farmer was not enthusiastic about the idea of this task and initially thought it was for his own convenience. Eventually he convinced the defendant to pay it back, which was enough to make it a 'joint enterprise'. The plaintiff farmers were now asking for further assistance as they were afraid of losing their property. The defendants farmer was also asked to help the plaintiff remove more trees. He agreed to help, but the plaintiff Farmers were now seeking damages for the damage caused by the defendant's cutting. The court dismissed the claim and awarded damages against the defendant for the felled trees and for the plaintiff in the amount of $3,750 for tree removal. It would not matter whether the defendant supplied the chainsaw or the gas. The lawyer could not have foreseen that the plaintiff would be so intent on removing the trees. If the plaintiff had been paying the defendant, he would have been less liable. The claim against the plaintiff was dismissed."
e_2002skpc80.txt,"The accused was charged with owning a dog that without provocation attacked a person contrary to the Urban Municipality Act s.135.3(3). There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001. At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions. The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced. HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions. The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post. There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled. The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty. 2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3). It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands. The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed. logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog. One would not expect dog to be attached to logging chain if there were no concerns.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 135.3(3) of the Urban Municipalities Act. The evidence indicated that the accused's dog escaped through a garbage can enclosure, and then ran through a nearby house. The accused also displayed a sign on the fence warning of the presence of the dog with the words 'Guard Dog on Duty, Beware of Dog' on it. HELD: The accused was found guilty of four counts of assault contraryto s.135.3. The court accepted the accused’s evidence that the dog ran toward the complainant, chased her down a street, and finally, when the complainant’ s daughter got into her vehicle and drove away, the dog was kept within the fence. The appropriate fine was $200. On the definition of attack, as understand it, the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an attack on the complainant."
b_2010nssc387.txt,"The small claims adjudicator granted an order for substituted service after the respondent had trouble serving the appellant with notice of her claim. As per the order, she personally served the appellant's mother and notified the appellant of the hearing date by text message. He didn't appear and default judgement was granted against the appellant in the amount of $11,031.35. The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice. He denied being in contact with his mother. He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries. New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal. Appeal dismissed. The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny. Here the respondent's claim was valid. The adjudicator had the jurisdiction/authority to make an order for substituted service and the respondent followed it. At the very least, the appellant was notified of the hearing dates by text message(s). While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set. He failed to prove he had a reasonable excuse for defaulting, chose to ignore the notice, and was mistaken only as to what would be the outcome if he failed to appear.","The respondent appeals a decision of the Adjudicator of the Small Claims Court. The respondent appeals that decision by Notice of Appeal (form 9) dated June 16th, 2010 and within the 30 day appeal period. The singular ground of appeal cited in the appellant's Notice is a failure to follow the requirements of natural justice. The appellant mistakenly showed up for the hearing on the wrong date, which was one day after the actual hearing. While waiting around for half an hour, he checked the doors of the Court House several times, then assumed that Court was cancelled because of bad weather. On that hearing date, the adjudicator issued an order for Substituted Service by serving a copy of the claim on the respondent's mother and by texting to the defendant the new hearing date. This means the Respondent did everything that she was directed to do by the Small Claim Court and the Court did what it was authorized to do under the Act and Regulations. Service having been properly effected on the Respondents, the Court is not prepared to interfere with this finding of the small claims adjudicator."
e_2012nssc101.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15. The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","The accused was charged with four counts of sexual assault. The Crown alleged that the accused touched the victim with his penis and moved between houses. The accused and the victim both believed that this was for sexual purposes. The victim testified that the allegations were made against both the accused and his sister. The evidence at trial suggested that the two children considered the accused uncle to be an uncle. The third child considered the other uncle to have been an uncle to the accused. The court concluded that the relationship between the parties was one of reliability and that the witness had a motive to lie. The essential elements of sexual assaulting were comprehensively addressed in R. v. Ewanchuk 1999 CanLII 711 (SCC), [1999] 1) the accused had a common-law relationship with the complainant. He had two children, one of whom was between 10 and 11 years old. The other child was a very close friend of the complainant and her sister. Both children considered their uncle to been an Uncle. The Court found that the Crown failed to prove that the other child had intentionally touched the complainant's body or that the contact was for a sexual purpose. The defence argued that the evidence from the two witnesses was inconsistent, and that it was difficult for the accused to maintain a reasonable distance from the complainant, especially since she had numerous other persons to confide in and disclosed to. The trial judge also questioned the credibility of the witnesses, both of whom gave generalized allegations of sexual offence. The complainant's evidence was not credible since she was inconsistent in her testimony, inconsistent in the manner of giving evidence, and delayed her disclosure for so long. The judge concluded that, in general, the accused's evidence is not credible. The facts were found to support the Crown's argument that the four counts were mere extrapolations of the facts. The essence of the essential elements, sexual assault, and the essential relationship between a person and their relationship, were comprehensibly addressed in this case."

Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence. The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. Allowing the appeal would be in the child's best interests as she had resided with the adoptive parents for the past three years and would continue to do so pending the further hearing.","The appellant was the birth mother of a child born in 2002. A temporary guardianship order was issued in Alberta, which was later terminated in favour of private guardianship by the respondents. The child was residing with her birth parents at the time of her birth. The parties initially put themselves forward as potential adoptive parents but later lost the application and the permanent guardianship ordered when the private guardianships order was terminated in favor of private guardianhip by them. The appellant was granted access to the child. She appealed the permanent guardianhip order which was terminated and replaced by a Private Guardianship Order, which provided access by the birth parents to the applicant. The applicant applied to have the access restored. Appeal allowed; the judge's decision on the application to adopt was not made lightly; the due diligence requirement was not met. The appeal and remitting matter to the application court would make no comment on the merits of the appellant's intended submissions to that court; the presiding judge would not comment on her intended submissions; the parties were unaware that the appellant birth mother wished to be heard.

Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it. There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question. The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement. 19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.  20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them. 21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed. It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer. The same question can be put if the first did not answer it. The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each. The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings. Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was. Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings. As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings. It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with. There were no exceptional circumstances.  24)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The defendants applied to compel responses to a large number of questions that were objected to at examinations for discovery of proper officers on behalf of Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (SPMC). The plaintiffs alleged that a fire stop was applied to the tower by SPMC. The defendants sought to know whether the plaintiffs had any position on the issue. The only thing that would be required is that names of potential expert witnesses were not discoverable. The plaintiffs objected to the question asking whether SPMc's employees were privileged. The question asked was whether SGI's insurer was involved in the investigation of the loss following the fire. The answer was that it did. Objection No. 6-P. 297, Line 2 had no objection to the questions asked but the plaintiffs' objection was that the question required an expert opinion. HELD: The question was too vague to answer. The questions can be asked of any third party. The plaintiff's claim in excess of $7,000,000 is in excess $7k,000. The defendant's claim is in over $7K,000 in excesses. 1)The question related to the manner of the plaintiffs investigation and is not proper. The respondents were not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses. 2)The only thing which would be compelling to an expert is if SPMCs had a liaison with the plaintiffs. The Court was not able to tell whether that liaison was a third party or whether the plaintiff was a party to the action. 3)The plaintiffs were not required to answer the question as they were not privileged. 4)The plaintiff was not entitled in any way to know what observations the defendant had or whether any of the witnesses described. The court could not locate any photographs taken by the plaintiffs and upon which the plaintiffs may have relied. The names of the plaintiff's expert who prepared the documents were privileged and the plaintiffs were never required to provide that information."
c_2012skqb426.txt,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code. The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed. The accused is 52 years old and in poor health. He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders. The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence. Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown had applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender is 52 years old and has a significant criminal record. The Court has jurisdiction to entertain the dangerous offender application because it is both the court which entered the conviction against the offender and is a superior court of criminal jurisdiction. HELD: The Court found that the offender is a high risk to re-offend violently and that, therefore, his risk to do so is high. The court found that if he continues to deny his culpability and sabotage his attendance in programming, his chance to continue to perpetrate violent crimes will continue to be high. It is an absolute necessity that he seriously addresses his apparent alcohol abuse problem and makes a commitment to sobriety for the remainder of his life. The risk to continue in this violent offending behaviour is high and it will be mitigated only if he applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his frustration and anger."
b_2010skqb187.txt,"The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits. The defendant failed to make any payment. The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale. The defendant was a developer. He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act. The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price. HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply. The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA. There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision. The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. Normal bidding rules shall apply. The plaintiff was entitled to costs.","HELD: The application was dismissed and the usual bidding rules applied. The applicant had not followed the rules of the Court as required by s. 11 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The land was purchased from Alberta Ltd. in 2007 and held by FMI. None of the defendants entered defence but served demands for notice and then were noted for default of defence on March 12, 2010. By its notice of motion in March 2010, the applicant sought an order nisi for judicial sale, arguing that the proceedings commenced in the wrong circumstances and that they were void of the SFSA. The application by the applicant was dismissed. The court found that the 2014 SFSA was not intended to be a means to an end for the applicant. The purpose of the bidding process in a judicial sale remedy contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that the applicant is owed an amount on the mortgage and that it will likely receive a significant cash payout on sale does not modify the desirability and necessity of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. To do otherwise would be to pay heed to the financial strengths of one or more of the parties, or at least give a preferred position to the entity seeking foreclosure. The bidding rules shall apply."
2_2005skqb513.txt,"FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003. They are married and the family home is in Connecticut. The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.  1) The child was born in Canada. He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003. In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit. It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child. In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner. Reconciliation was attempted. The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned. The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada. For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence. At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles. The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy. Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut. The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home. 2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody. The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate. Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut. This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.","FIAT: The parties were the parents of a child born in April 2003. They were married in February 2004 and the family home was in Connecticut. In March 2004, the respondent mother, Canadian citizen, returned to Canada. The parties' relationship became strained and the petitioner father, an American citizen, brought an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The child was returned to the petitioner. The Court found that the respondent's intention to return was to continue living with the child and that it was in the best interests of the child to have the child return to Connecticut so that he could pursue his career in the military. The court found that it would be impossible for the respondent to unilaterally return to Canada given the circumstances. The child's habitual residence was now in the State of Connecticut and the Court determined that the return to be conditional upon the petitioner obtaining an ex parte order granting him sole custody. The petitioner was awarded sole custody with conditions including that the child must enter into a new relationship with the petitioner, return to the respondent, return the child, make an effort to reconcile with her, and that the Court find that the circumstances in which the parties had settled upon their new relationship were intolerable. The case law was at odds as to whether reference should be had to the domestic statute when addressing the issue of habitual residency under the Convention."

This fiat concerned several documents. The Crown had already disclosed the contents of each of these documents and the only matter remaining in issue was the name of the lawyer who released the information. This arose as a result of the action of a Regina lawyer who had improperly revealed information from two of his divorce clients with respect to the charges against LaPorte et al. The Crown quite properly disclosed these statements which had been conveyed to the investigating officer.

3_2001nssc117.txt,"The plaintiffs were Sergeants in the Town of Bedford Police Department. Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank. The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement. After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights. The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed. Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court. It is irrelevant if the plaintiffs have now lost their rights to initiate the arbitration process.","The Halifax Regional Municipality Act, effective as April 1, 1996, provided for the amalgamation of the municipal police forces into the Halifax Regional municipality. The plaintiffs were part of a Bargaining Unit represented by the Municipal Association of Police Personnel (MAPP). The plaintiff police officers were originally classified as police officers but later became members of the bargaining unit represented by MAPP. They were reduced in rank to Sergeant after a dispute arose regarding their rights as police officer in the municipality. They sued the MAPP board, alleging that the two-tier system for the sergeant violated s. 35(1) of the Regulations made under the Police Act, which states that if a dispute arises out of the collective agreement, it is not an adequate forum for resolving the dispute. The plaintiff officers were awarded their damages against the defendants, who represented them in the grievance procedure. The defendants appealed. Appeal dismissed; the parties' ability to consent to change was not limited to the certified bargaining agent. The parties agreed to arbitration, which would have resolved the grievance. The two-way system for a sergeant was not applicable in the Halifax regional municipality because the plaintiff officers had not been union members. The only way to get the plaintiff's consent for any change to terms and conditions of employment was by submitting a grievance to the Board of Police Commissioners. The Board of Directors had jurisdiction to hear the grievance and to take appropriate remedy. The trial judge found that the parties had not agreed on any of the required changes to terms of the agreement and that the plaintiff was entitled to a fair hearing. The decision of the Board was appealed. Allowing the appeal, that the trial judge determined that the issues were matters which fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribunal, and therefore the court had jurisdiction not to inquire into the complaint and to fix the appropriate remedy; the plaintiff had not proven that the defendants had breached s.35(1)."

Quite apart from certification and voluntary recognition, the union could attain bargaining rights pursuant to Part II of the Trade Union Act, which allowed an employer in the construction industry to assign bargaining and negotiating rights to an 'accredited employers' association' such as the Construction Management Labour Bureau Ltd.

e_2001skqb128.txt,"The mother had custody of the 12 and year olds under the terms of the January 10, 2000 consent judgment. The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","The parties applied to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment, including his contribution to child care expenses and access provisions. The respondent claimed his income had been reduced and referred to his 1999 tax return indicating an income of $42,386.34. The petitioner argued that his mother no longer available to provide child care for him. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The parties agreed upon a total of $1,000 per month based upon his reported income but rather, to reflect his true income including cash and unreported income. There has been no material change in the circumstances of the children since the consent judgement. The material does not satisfy the Court there has been any material change. The application is dismissed with Costs. 2)The respondent did not suggest that there had been any change in his hours of work or work schedule. What had changed is that his father had died prior to the pre-trial conference and he no longer offered to provide support during the day on the Saturday of his access weekends. What has changed is his mother is no longer able to afford to provide childcare for him during the week."

The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. She alleged that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. The court could not find clear instructions were given to the town to disconnect the water service. The form executed by the plaintiff clearly indicated request for final billing. HELD: The plaintiff was dismissed with costs to the Town of Martensville. 1)The court could find no clear instructions to the plaintiff to disconnect her water service and there was a substantial likelihood of the pipes bursting and the damage being caused to the property. 2)The plaintiff was not making any effort to assess the damages caused to her property. It was impossible to assess proximate damages without causing the plaintiff”s daughter to suffer damage to her home and thereby causing her daughter to lose her property and thus the court would have to assess her damages in the amount of $50,000.  3)The evidence showed a misunderstanding between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now used for disconnect purposes, elevate the likelihood of damage to the premises.  4)The Court concluded that the plaintiff could not succeed for the same reasons as the plaintiff did. The action could not have been attended to by the daughter because of the lengthy period of time between disconnections. The water service was not regularly disconnected and, on occasion, the plaintiff had to be disconnected in the winter."

He underwent a successful alcohol and drug addiction program and was working with a significant other. The accused and the victim had a tumultuous relationship, which led to some problems between them. The relationship ended badly and the accused now sought new employment. The Court found that the accused had a previous record of drinking, but did not file a victim impact statement, nor did the victim agree to it. The defence argued that the victim impact statements were not specifically mentioned and that the offence was aggravating. The court imposed a fine of $1,500 plus a probation order for two years and ordered the victim to pay a victim fine of approximately $225. The offence was determined to be aggravating and the factors which led the Court to impose a sentence of 18 months to 2 years less one day was imposed, which the victim did not have.

The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own. The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university. The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008. The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","FIAT: The parties filed an application for an order varying child support. The declaration that the children were no longer children of the marriage and that they no longer be children of that marriage was granted in May 1999.

The parties agree that given the age of the children, and the change in the amount of the respondent's income, that there has been a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. The order sought to be varied is based upon the respondent’s 2007 income of $44,781 and the fact that he had not withdrawn from the marriage. The respondent submitted that his income from university had reduced to $20,000 and he believed that given his income and the changes in the respondent family’ s. expenses, the amount payable by him to the petitioner was $380 per month plus 33% of all s. expense.

The application for variation requested that he be allowed to pay any maintenance payable for Keegan directly to him. The petitioner requested that the amount be increased to $10,587. The applicant was granted this amount by monthly payments of $200 per month. 2) As success has been divided in respect of this application, there will be no order as to costs."

The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","The Crown appealed a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act.

HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit, failing to take into account the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the respondent, the criminal history and other circumstances of the offender, and his need for psychological and substance abuse counseling and further education. 2) The respondent was already served the 90 day closed custody portion of the sentence originally imposed. That sentence was to be set aside. In addition to the time already served, the respondent is to serve 12 months in closed custody to be followed by 7 months community policing. There is no suggestion in the decision that deterrence was a factor taken into account."
8_2001skca55.txt,"The Crown sought leave to appeal a conditional sentence of 9 months of time served plus 2 years less 1 day, including 3 months on electronic monitoring, and 2 years probation with a 10 year firearm prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently. The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation. The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence. The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers. The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims. The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances. He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times. He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent after a sentencing circle. The Crown sought to attach a mitigating factor to the sentence: the respondent had pled guilty to two offences of robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and 334(2) of the Criminal Code, and had previously been sentenced to nine months time served, plus two years less one day conditional, including three months on electronic monitoring, plus 2 years probation with a ten year firearms prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently. The respondent emphasized he was on drugs at the time of the offences and the main player was the co-accused. The co-occused received a sentence of seven years on the robbery and five years concurrent on the breaking and entering. The defence argued the sentencing circle was inappropriate in these circumstances given the level of violence, the respondent's high risk to reoffend, his consistent ignoring of or refusing to follow court orders and the fact a penitentiary term was called for. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. The sentence imposed was set aside and a sentence taken into account the time the respondent served on remand and on electronic monitor. The court denounced the sentence and expressed its condemnation of the coaccused and his failure to obey court order."

The plaintiff applies for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 485 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The parties agree that damages should be assessed on the basis of the affidavit evidence. HELD: 1) The defendant pled guilty to a charge of assault causing bodily harm. He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30. 2) The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and significant pain for a number of months after the assault. Extensive dental treatment was required and will be required at some point in the future. The plaintiff has minimal scarring. He is awarded general damages of $12,500. 3) The pleadings and the affidavit evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages. However, the photographs graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered. Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers. These circumstances justify an award of aggravated damages in the sum of $2,000. 4) The plaintiff was awarded special damages in the amount of $1,911.70.","The plaintiff was standing with other patrons near the entrance to a pub when the defendant punched him in the face and knocked him unconscious. The plaintiff claims damages for injuries sustained in the assault. Liability is admitted and the plaintiff now applies for summary judgment and an assessment of damages pursuant to Rule 485. HELD: 1) The Court of Appeal reviewed Queen's Bench Rule 153 and found that the injuries sustained by the plaintiff as result of the defendant's assault were serious but not life threatening. Extensive dental treatment was required and further treatment will be required in the future. The Plaintiff had some minimal scarring and disfigurement but found that it was not significant. Excluding any component for aggravated damages the Plaintiff's general damages are $12,500.00. 2) The Plaintiff shall have judgment against the defendant calculated as follows: general damages of $12 million. Aggravated damages of approximately $1,000.70. 3) The court also found that a fair award for general damages was $12.500. Excluded any component of aggravated damages is $1.911.70 which is a $16,411.70 plus costs and pre-judgment interest."
6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The issues in this case centre around claim by the plaintiff for damages for failure to give reasonable notice of termination for unpaid holiday pay that he alleged was owing to him at the date of his dismissal. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The jury determined that the plaintiff was constructively dismissed and awarded the plaintiff damages.HELD: 1) The plaintiff was hired by the defendant in 1988 as the superintendent of the Woodlawn Regional Park. He was awarded holidays in lieu of time off. 2) In 1990 the plaintiff made another proposal to the defendant, this time based on a 40 hour work week. The defendant accepted the plaintiff's proposal and the plaintiff began receiving holiday pay in lieu by his wages. 3) In 1991 the plaintiff asserted a claim for damages against the defendant for failure not to give a reasonable notice to him. The claim for the damages for failed to give'reasonable notice of dismissal' was also brought. The court held that if the defendant had found that the defendant's all-inclusive contract was not sufficient to meet its burden to establish damage, the plaintiff would have been awarded the damages in lieu. 4) In the alternative the defendant claims that the doctrine of estoppel or waiver should apply to prevent the plaintiff from claiming his entitlement to holiday pay. The onus, then shifts to the plaintiff to prove that the defendants complied with some exception in the Labour Standards Act. 5) The defendant asserted that the plaintiffs holiday pay should be based on his monthly wage plus one-half of his truck allowance, which was $250 per month. The plaintiffs clearly indicated that the $250.00 portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. The Court reviewed the various types of holiday pay payable by the parties and found that they were all in agreement. The only way overtime can be considered payable should be by the determination and the assessor to determine the amount of holiday payable. The parties agreed that the holiday pay obligation should be calculated on the basis of their respective pay stubs, not their respective union awards. The argument that holiday pay is a wage disguised for the purposes of avoiding taxation is rejected. The doctrine of de novo waiver should applied to prevent this plaintiff from asserting his entitlement. As such, it would be contrary to public policy for this Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff’s actions by calculating his holiday pay on the principles of the Labour SSA and the principles in s.3 of the LSA. 6) The"
b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","The accused applied for a declaration that s.300 of the Criminal Code constitutes an unreasonable limitation of one or more of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s.2, s.3(c) and s.11(d) of the Charter and a Declaration that s300 and 301 of the Code fail to describe an offence known in law. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The accused were found guilty of three counts of defamatory libel. The Court must consider all expression that is potentially restricted by s300 of The Code, not only the expressions involved in this case. 2)The threshold test for the application of s.303 was met. Section 300 of the code constitutes a reasonable limit in free and democratic society on the freedom of expression guaranteed by ss2(b) of The Charter and is therefore upheld under s. of the charter. 3)The Court must not be diverted by the offensive content of particular speech giving rise to the Charter challenge. The accused are guilty of four counts of publishing defamatories. 4)The principles of fundamental fairness, decency and respect for the dignity of the individual are at issue. 5)The Act is not inherently unfair or in breach of s2(c). 6)S.300 is a minimal impairment on the right to freedom of speech which is a fundamental right of a free anddemocratic society. The Act is also not in breach or in excess of s300."
b_1991canlii4497.txt,"A large diseased elm tree fell on a truck and injured the plaintiff driver. For some years prior to the accident, the defendant had operated a hazardous tree removal program.

For the plaintiff, that there is a prima fade duty of care owed by the Department of Transportation to users of highway against reasonably foreseeable hazards, including the falling of trees onto the highway. Further, the defendant had a duty to use a reasonable standard of care in the operation of the hazardous tree removal program. The defendant was negligent in failing to train the inspector properly. The Court referred at length to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Just v. British Columbia. The defendant's claim against the third parties (owners/occupiers of property on which tree stood) was dismissed.","The plaintiff was injured when a tree fell on his truck. He was working on a project to remove trees from a public highway. The defendant landowners brought an action against the plaintiff and his employer, alleging negligence by the Attorney General. The plaintiff was in good health and driving his half ton truck on the back road when the tree fell. The defendants' action was discontinued. This defendant had joined the plaintiff's inattentive and negligent actions against the other defendants. The plaintiffs' action against each defendant was discontinued as a result of the AttorneyGeneral's refusal to discontinue the action against them. The Court considered that the evidence suggested that the tree had not fallen due to DED but from Ganoderma applanatum, a fungus which was common on stumps but rare on the area of the wound. It was also possible that the plaintiffs' case may have been influenced by wind and rain. Dismissing the action, that in order to establish a duty of care in a given situation, it is necessary to bring the facts of that situation within those of previous situations in which duty of justice had been held to exist."
d_2009skqb70.txt,"At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","The respondent was paying $28,889.75 per month for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident as per s. 117 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The respondent argued that the IRB for the 179th and subsequent day period was less than the IRIB calculated for the first 180 days as determined pursuant to s. 116 of the Act. HELD: The respondent's IRB was correctly calculated when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 and then reduced the net income to 90% and then increased the netincome to 90%. The Court of Appeal upheld the respondent's appeal. The trial judge found that SGI had correctly calculated the respondent’s IRB when it reduced the respondent by 90% to find the respondent and then reduce the respondent at 90% for the post 180 day period. The Court held that SGE had correctly determined the respondent as a non-earner. The appellant appealed SGI’S calculation of the IRBs for the non-income earners on the basis of pre-judgment interest. The parties were paying $27,889 to each other. The hearing judge found SGI was correctly calculating the respondent. The appeal court upheld the Saskatchewan Court of appeal’ s. 29 decision. The appellants were paying the respondent an amount less than that. The court found that the phrase “subject to the other provisions of the Division” as meaning “governed by” or “affected by’ the other provision of the division, is a standard definition of the phrase. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce the income replacement benefit (IRB) for the other types of earners by 90%."

The complainant described certain incidents that amounted to sexual assault when she was under the age of 16. The Respondent had previously been acquitted of charges based on the same allegations in criminal court. The Respondent has abused a child within the meaning of the Act. Although the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities, it is elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and their implications. However, it is considerably less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.",The Agency applied to find that the father had abused a child pursuant to s. 62(a) or (b) of the Children and Family Services Act. The mother of the child had stayed with the father for some time and alleged that he had sexual contact with her on the basis that she would lie down and he would play with his dog's penis. This was corroborated by the father's testimony and the mother's own admission that she had a sexual assault when she was fifteen years old. The father's credibility had not been impeached and the evidence of the complainant's alleged assault had more probability of truth than disbelief.
4_2000canlii2633.txt,"The parties were married for 14 years and separated in 1995, entering into a detailed Separation Agreement in 1998. The two children of the marriage are 16 and 8 years of age. There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment. The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training. For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00 The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since. The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment. This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties. The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose. Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001. An adjustment was also made to account for arrears in child support and child support payments.","The parties were married 14 years and had two children, ages 16 and 8. There had been a number of interim applications and interim orders since their separation, most of which related to the husband's need for support. The parties entered into a partial agreement and settlement in 2000 which provided for joint care and custody of the children with their primary residence being with their mother and their day to day care. The husband had taken out plans through employment to provide coverage for the children and the parties had not had any lengthy period of financial stability throughout their entire 14 years of cohabitation. The Divorce Act requires priority be given to support of children and, if the parties have not had that, a Corollary Relief Judgment will be issued. The mother was to advise the husband of the particulars of her bank account in Canada. The father was to obtain a credit for $1,000 from the Bank of Nova Scotia and $2,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The wife was to file a claim for her remaining $1 million in arrears. The court ordered that all arrear of child support be paid to the wife, with the costs to be paid in the U.S. dollar. The respondent was to apply for a share of the settlement proceeds to be divided among the spouses. The Court found that the parties' income was so low as to be beyond the reach of reasonable people. The evidence showed that the husband paid $1.5 million per year for medical and other benefits separate from the post tax deductions for long term disabilities, but the amount was so high that he was unable to afford them. He should have received a further $1m in advance of his pay periods in the hope of avoiding any future shortfall. The Chambers judge was to determine the appropriate level of spousal support."
5_1993canlii6695.txt,"The plaintiff applied under Queen's Bench Rule 231 to strike the statements of defence of a corporate and individual defendant for failure to attend scheduled examinations despite service of an appointment and payment of conduct money to their solicitor. The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences. Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution. Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer. This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants. The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","The plaintiff applied to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant after it was found that the designated officer of the corporation, the designated officers, failed to appear at an examination for discovery on the basis of a lack of an appointment. The corporate defendant had previously provided written notice to the plaintiff's solicitors that the officer was no longer an officer or director of the Corporation and that he would need the 'appropriate' conduct money. The plaintiff's solicitor had also written to the corporate defendants seeking further notice, suggesting a possible date for the examinations. HELD: The applications were dismissed. 1)The Court was satisfied on the ground of the conduct exhibited throughout the whole of these proceedings that the defendants were guilty of contempt of court. The defendants had abused the discretion of the court that was exercised in their favour to set aside judgments obtained against them and to permit them to file defences. 2)The non-attendances of the defendants on November 23, 1993 did not constitute'refusing or neglecting to attend' within the meaning of Rule 231. It could not be utilized respecting these particular non- attendances to strike their statements of defence. The contempt proceedings were still before the court even though they were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants filed statements of defense. The current applications before the Court clearly indicate that the defendant or the corporation have little or no regard for the administration of justice. The actions undertaken by the defendants in the course of these applications clearly indicates that they have little to no regard or care for the court's administration of law. The conduct of the defendant's solicitor and his representatives throughout the proceedings has been inconsistent with the court finding that the plaintiff has made unreasonable and unprofessional demands of his clients in the process of scheduling the examinations for which he was appointed. It is inherent in Rule 231 that a person must be legally compellable to attend the time and place appointed for his examination before he can be found to be'refused or neglectful to attend'.

1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","The appellant was an employer and the respondent union. By successorship, they were parties to a collective agreement signed in 1994. The collective agreement establishes employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments for each year. The union opposed the employer's application to strike the union's statement of claim on the grounds that the claims were outside the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The employer appealed. Appeal allowed; the Chambers judge dismissed the application. The question of whether the dispute was arbitrable applies here because an arbitrators' jurisdiction is not open to the court. There were several factual questions relevant to that issue which could not be explored on an application under Rule 14.25."
