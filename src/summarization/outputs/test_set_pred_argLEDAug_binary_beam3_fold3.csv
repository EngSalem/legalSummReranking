1994canlii4187.txt,"The petitioner sought a divorce and maintenance for herself and the couple's five-year old child. The wife was working and earned a modest income; the husband a substantial one. Allowing the application, that although the wife upgraded her education during the marriage with encouragement and financial support from the husband, she was entitled to maintenance for an indefinite period. The court reviewed the means and needs of the parties and awarded spousal in addition to child maintenance. The court recognized the indirect financial consequences to a custodial parent in raising children.","The wife sought a divorce, as well as maintenance for herself and the five year old daughter of the marriage. The parties had been married 10 years, and had been together for 10 years. The wife sought to have the Separation Agreement and Minutes of Settlement incorporated into a Corollary Relief Judgment so far as the jurisdiction of the court permits. The husband, who had recently retired from his employment as a bar manager, sought to increase the child's education fund by $1,500 per year. The mother, who was the primary caregiver to the child, was an innately intelligent and ambitious person. The Court awarded monthly maintenance to the wife to terminate in years; the support deadline should not be placed upon her when she has the direct responsibility of raising the child and when the availability of more gainful employment within the foreseeable future is uncertain."
1994canlii4796.txt,"The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer. In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan. There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","The applicant sought a declaration under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the 'Group Plan') was not subject to a security interest she granted to Crown Life. She further sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the Group Plan. HELD: The application for a restraining order was denied. 1)The provisions of s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act do not apply to the applicant. The taking of security interest by way of a loan agreement contravenes s. 146(2) and s.147(3) as they do not include an attachable pension refund. Since the applicant has not retired and no pension refund exists, there appears to be no monetary sum current for Crown Life to set off, unless a proper request for a transfer has been made by the application by Ms. Corscadden. 2)The applicant had not retired. The provisions of the Plan Contract and the reasons in Phenix did not apply. The applicant's request for direct transfer did not comply with s.7.03 as the provision set out in Information Circular 72-22R8 published by Revenue Canada and Revenue Canada. 3)Nothing in the plan contract or the Income tax Act prohibits Crown Life or the Association from setting off the applicant's indebtedness against any monetary sum due from it to her. Since Ms.Cadden has notretired and no retirement benefit payment arising as a result of a similar action arose pursuant to s.57 of the tax act and R.S.C. 1985, the arrangements for the provision of a pension refund in the form of a lump sum or transfer to a registered retirement income fund (RRIF) are of no assistance in light of the provisions of this Act. 4)The legal effect of the loan agreement was similar to the security arrangements discussed in McMahon v. Canadian Permanent Trust Company, 1979 CanLII 769 (BC CA), [1980] W.W.R. 438 (B.C., C.C.; and Re Lifshen). 5)Since the applicant is an insurance company and is authorized to issue annuitant retirement savings plans (herein described as a'retirement savings plan'), the provisions in s.(a) and (b)of the plan have not been incorporated into the plan. The provision of s.(c) which prohibits an annuitants from pledging their interest in the group plan and the provisions"

The City applied for a review. HELD: The City's application was allowed. Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question. Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act.","The City applied to have the Director of Labour's Standards Branch issued a certificate pursuant to s. 60 of the Labour Standards Act declaring that the City owed its transit employee $511.08 in wages.

The provisions of the agreement should govern, and not those of, the Act.

1995canlii4337.txt,"This was an appeal from the decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board allowing an appeal from the decision of the Victims' Services Division denying compensation to the respondent on the basis the police had not proceeded with criminal charges for an assault which had occurred. Dismissing the appeal, that the Board had correctly interpreted its jurisdiction and made findings amply supported by the evidence arising from the de novo hearing. Failure of the police to lay a charge against the attacker did not disqualify the applicant from compensation if it was otherwise supported by the evidence.","The appellant appealed a decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board concerning an award of compensation pursuant to the Victims' Rights and Services Act. He alleged that the police investigation had not proceeded with criminal charges and the appellant was not a victim. The appellant appealed.

1996canlii6881.txt,"FIAT. The parties were divorced in 1995 and all issues including spousal maintenance were left in abeyance. The petitioner had agreed to pay $3,000 per month which included child support but the support was reduced to $1,000 and was irregular and late. The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment. The petitioner's income exceeded $80,000 annually but he had been suspended with pay and the status of his employment was uncertain. HELD: 1)It was premature to fix the amount of spousal maintenance as asked for by the applicant. There were too many unknowns including the future of the petitioner's future job and income and how much the applicant would require should she go to university in the fall and what the children would do about future education. 2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the maintenance. 3)The petitioner was directed to pay $1,500 plus $200.00 per month until the shortfall was paid in full.  4)The applicant was awarded costs of the application.","FIAT. The parties separated in the summer of 1994. All other issues raised in the divorce proceeding were left in abeyance including the issue of spousal maintenance. The petitioner had unilaterally reduced the monthly support from $3,000 to $1,500 for the months of September through December 1995. Since then the petitioner had reduced the support to $900 per month. HELD: 1)The application was premature. There were too many unknown factors surrounding the future situation of either party to conclude that what the applicant asks for is fair and reasonable. There was uncertainty of the petitioner's future job and income. There is uncertainty as to what she will require if she does go to a university this fall. There are uncertainty asto what the children of the marriage might do about future education. 2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the $1500.00 maintenance he consistently paid up to December 1995 to $800.00 without at least consulting with the petitioner. Had these payments continued the applicant would have recovered $6,000.00 at the suggested guideline figure. 3)Since the petitioner was paying the petitioner $2,400 per month in the interim, it was not appropriate to apply the amount of maintenance that she had asked for at that amount. 4)Since she had already received direct and indirect support in the form of $1/3 of each month, 1)of which was directed towards the purpose of commencing the application on the 1/3/96 basis and 1/4 of each day thereafter, and 1)being the direct way in which she got direct support instead of the indirect way in that she got the other $3/3 from the 1st day of every month, 2)of each month directly towards the end of the month, and 3)of every month thereafter, she got $1% of the actual amount in the amount actually paid by the petitioner on each and every day of the application, rather than on the whole of the day she received the full amount as required by law."
1997canlii787.txt,"After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, the plaintiff, a supplier of materials to the sub-contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub-contractor. The Bond contained a provision limiting the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to any claimant not having a contract directly with the principal. Dismissing the action with costs, that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier. With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work. As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff. Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond.","After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, a supplier of materials to the sub contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a Labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the subcontractor. The contract stipulated that if the mechanics' lien act had applied, the contractor would have been required to recover from the buyer the amount owing by the subcontractor; in the absence of the Act, the supplier would not have been entitled to recover anything due to the third party statutory liens. HELD: The claims of the plaintiff and London Guarantee were dismissed. 1)The Mechanics' Lien Act does not expressly state that it binds the Crown. Therefore, the amount of the lien fund available to subcontractors if the Mechanics'Lien Act had applied would only be limited to what the contractor might have been obliged to pay had the Act applied. 2)The evidence showed no intention to contract, no valuable consideration, and no promise to pay. The informality of the handwritten memo containing no words of explicit promise belie an intention to bind a commercial corporation such as Rideau Construction. If the Mechanics's Lien act was applicable, the applicant would not be entitled to recovered anything due the third parties statutory lienses. 3)The applicant would pay the costs of the two defendants, which will be a single amount as may be agreed upon with counsel or, if agreement is not possible, will be set by the Court at the time an Order for Judgment is taken out."
1999canlii12427.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching contrary to s.271(1) and 153 of the Criminal Code. The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused often slept on the couch in the basement of the house adjacent to the room where the family watched TV. There was a couch or love seat in the living room adjacent to where the children would usually sleep. Sometimes he would sleep down there because he was angry with the complainant's mother for not wanting to have sex with him. The complainant called the police. The accused was convicted of both charges. HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of both counts. 1)The accused had an opportunity and did everything he was accused of doing. He had the opportunity and the evidence confirmed his evidence. 2)There was not enough evidence to convict the accused of all the offences. The Court rejected the accused's allegations of sexual assault, because they were not supported by the evidence of his other accusers. 3)The Court found enough circumstantial evidence to conclude the accused was not guilty of all of the offences listed. The only evidence that was not supported was that his behaviour was dangerous beyond the reasonable doubt of doubt and the odds of him being found guilty were at odds with the Crown's and SIN's. 4)The only proof was that he was drunk. The alcohol was not involved. The drugs were not considered a factor. 5)Any other evidence would have confirmed the accused’s evidence. He was not dangerous. His behaviour was not violent. His words were not meant to be taken seriously and his explanation of his behaviour with the children was beyond reasonable doubt. 6)No medical evidence was necessary. An expert witness would have been extremely helpful to the Court."

She raised s.9 and 8 of the Charter in objecting to the arrest and seizure of the duffel bag. The voir dire occupied 5 days. HELD: 1)The four requirements set out in R. v. Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied. The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the duffel bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. 2)The accused had no expectation of privacy with respect to either her friend's residence or the bag. The decision in R. v. Edwards was squarely on point. There was no evidence tying the accused to the gym bag. It was of a different description than the one used in the drugstore robbery. The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it. The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter. To exclude the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused objected to her arrest and to the seizure of a duffel bag containing a quantity of narcotics. The police conducted a voir dire as result of the opening of the trial. A great deal of evidence was presented, the majority of which was elicited in very detailed and extended cross-examination. The accused also called evidence on the voir de dire but did not testify. HELD: The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the bag were incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. Pursuant to s. 9 and 8 of the Charter the police need not demonstrate anything more than reasonable and probable grounds. If there were any violations of the accused's rights under the Charter, the police would be entitled to search an arrested person for a weapon if under the circumstances it seemed reasonable to check whether the person might be armed.

Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace. HELD: The Crown failed to provide proper disclosure to defence counsel, the non-disclosure had an adverse effect of the accused's ability to make full answer in defence and the appropriate remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call Ace as a witness.","The accused was charged with break and enters of homes and was denied involvement.

The Crown counsel argued that although the Crown's specific intention was to call Whitecap as a witness had not been disclosed to the defence and that he would not be able to cross-examine effectively or at all.

A stay was in order as the accused had not had sufficient time to consider the evidence and the case before election or plea. 4)There was no evidence of the impunged non-closure having prejudiced the accused’s right to a full answer or defence and the prejudice to that was not caused by it not being disclosed. 5)A stay would have been appropriate but not in the amount of time it would have taken for the examination-in-chief to sit through the entire Crown case in order to be as effective as possible in the cross-examination of this witness. 6)The accused would not have been advantaged or disadvantaged if the Crown was forced to call another witness. 7)The delay in proceedings would have weighed against the accused in the fact that the accused would be sitting in the courtroom with the examination in-chief.

2005nssc364.txt,"The Agency applied for permanent care of a young child, with no access to the parents. Each of the mother, the biological father and the psychological father sought to have the child placed in their care. The child had been apprehended due to unsafe and unhealthy living conditions. The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses. The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child. The mother was against this plan. The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father. Child placed in the permanent care of the Agency with no access to the mother or the psychological father; access ordered to the biological father for a period of six months at which time the access order will expire automatically unless an application to vary is made; the Agency is to arrange for a parental capacity assessment of the biological father. The child continued to be at substantial risk of physical harm due to neglect if she was returned to the mother's care and the child would be at risk of exposure to violence if returned to the psychological father's care due to the tumultuous relationship between the mother and him. Although some improvements had recently been made in the mother's life, she had a history of frequent changes of residence and did not appear able put the child's needs ahead of her own. The Agency had not had an opportunity to assess the appropriateness of a placement with the biological father.","The agency applied for an order of permanent care and custody with no provision for access to the child. The mother opposed the application and requested an order returning the child to her care. The biological father who had minimal contact with the child was added as a party to the order. The Agency alleged that the child had been placed in the care of the psychological father because of instability in the home, the risk of physical harm caused by the mother and psychological father's failure to supervise the child, and that there was a risk of the child suffering harm as a result of the father's repeated threats to take the child from her. The psychological father argued that he did not wish to see the child taken into custody and that he would not allow the mother to have any contact with him. HELD: The child remained in the agency's custody pursuant to the protection order provided by the court. She was to have supervised visits with her daughter and a hearing was scheduled for September 15, 2005. 1)The burden of proof in proceeding such as this was clearly on the Agency. It was a civil burden that must have regard to the seriousness of the consequences of the decision. 2)The child had a long history of involvement with the father. She had taken the child into care because of problems with her environment, her anger at her mother, her repeated moves, her lack of supervision and her unwillingness to take steps to improve her relationship with her children. 3)The biological father was to continue to provide support and counselling to the children. 4)The mother was to complete anger management counselling with a psychologist. 5)Allowing the application in part, that the Agency must consider the gravity of the problem, the seriousness at which it is responsible to place the child in the hands of the parents, the circumstances in which it was taken, the reasons for the decision, the factors that led to the decision and the impact upon the child and her family. The agency must also consider the impact on the child if the child is to be returned to a parent or guardian. 6)The agency had no authority to compel the father to participate in child protection proceedings.

The names of the drivers stopped will not be disclosed and the actual notes of the officer are not ordered to be produced.,"FIAT: The Court must guard against the pursuit of what have been termed 'fishing expeditions' --speculative quests for information without any real expectation about the outcome of the quest or its relevance to the case. Here, the defence has already indicated that issues around s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter will be raised at trial. The Crown will make timely disclosure of: (a) the number of stops made by the RCMP in each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004; (b) the reason for each stop in the first place; (c) how many of those stops resulted in search for contraband, including narcotics; (d) Specifics of any other grounds for searches that were applied and how many times; (e) On how many occasions did the searches result in the finding of contraband; and (f) the actual notes of the RCMP officer. HELD: The Crown shall make timely and extensive authorities. The notes will presumably supply some details of the required disclosure as ordered above and as usual will be made available for the purposes of evidence at trial if required and shown to be relevant to the proceedings as they unfold. To pursue the fishing analogy so often used in the authorities, the purpose of such an inquiry will in part be to determine whether, in comparison with the guarantees given by the Charter, the investigation in this case 'cast too wide a net'."
2006nssc139.txt,"The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage. The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child. The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","The wife commenced divorce proceedings in November 2004.She sought custody, access, child support, spousal support and costs with a division of property in accordance with the Separation Agreement entered into between her and the husband in August 2004. The husband sought a variation of the provisions regarding child support and child support. It was his position that the particulars of the agreement did not and do not now reflect his net business income derived from self employment. He sought an increase in access. The mother argued the husband had failed to negotiate a mobility restriction clause which he assumed would protect his interests. HELD: 1) The Separation agreement was entered into to assure that his child would not be removed from his home town and that he was prepared to give her his equity in the home and possessions and guarantee her enough money per month to ensure she remained in the matrimonial home with his son. 2) The agreement clearly favours the mother. The father agreed to the terms of their agreement but did not ensure he was fully protected by overtly addressing mobility. There was no evidence of undue influence, fraud or evidence that would affect the ability to retain and instruct counsel. 3) There were no significant changes in the circumstances of the parties. The court was able to review the agreement as it was signed. 4) The parties had the opportunity to consult with independent counsel. The petitioner had no reason to believe that mobility would become an issue at some point. The paternal grandparents, who had similar interests in keeping the mother and her child in the jurisdiction, entered into a private arrangement unknown to lawyers and the court. 5) The father was to assume all his interest in the division of the property (except for his vehicle) in an amount that was not justified by his actual income or their circumstances. The parties did not have joint custody of the home.  6) The mother was to have the primary responsibility for all household expenses (including child care, utilities, advertising fees, fees, insurance and 100% of his motor vehicle expenses) in the amount of $1,600 per month for two years. 7) The respondent was to pay child support of $495.00 per month. 8) The Court was satisfied that all jurisdictional elements had been proven. There is no evidence to suggest it was unconscionable. The Court ought not to interfere with the agreement between the parties, especially in light of the changes in circumstances."
2006skqb382.txt,"The petitioner seeks child and spousal support. The parties signed a separation agreement and interspousal contract in July 2004. With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1) The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum. The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'. This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support. The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist. 2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program. Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year. The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006. It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000. Child support will be ordered based on $53,000 on an interim basis.","The petitioner sought child support and spousal support pending trial. The parties signed a separation agreement and interspousal contract in July 2004. The agreement provides that the respondent shall pay one half of the net income to the petitioner by way of equal monthly payments of spousals. The amount of payment shall be adjusted yearly to reflect the changing income of the parties. The respondent has no resources to pay back any interim support received. The petitioner seeks to set aside the settlement agreement on the grounds of undue influence and duress or alternatively that the agreement was unfair and unconscionable. HELD: The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and the circumstances as they presently exist. The court will proceed to pre-trial conference and trial if necessary on the question of whether the respondent is obliged to pursue work in his field as a computer consultant. 1)The agreement was incorporated into a consent order in December 2003. The one half division of income was to continue up to June 2007. Starting in the July 2007 through to June 2008 the formula was that the petitioner shall be entitled to 40% of the respondent's net income and the amount payable shall be reduced in an amount equal to 40 percent of the petitioner's income that she has earned. 2)There is no evidence to support the contention that the parties reached an agreement whereby the respondent was to pay $65,000 per annum in child and child support in the amount of $741.00 per month for the support of their two children. 3)This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim child support. There are no circumstances in which court could vary the agreement. If this court was to order interim spousAL support and the trial judge upheld the agreement, the fairness and equity of the interim order may be brought into question. In the circumstances, this is not the appropriate case for a retroactive order. Equity requires the agreement to be respected pending a trial."
2007skqb376.txt,"The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed.","The Court dismissed both applications for an order varying the child support order granted by the Justice R.D. Maher by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. The Court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances of the child and that, given that the oldest child had expressed a desire to live with her mother, it was not enough that the change had adversely affected the child."

There is conflicting information about the nature and extent of the petitioner father's parenting duties. The respondent has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child go with her. The petitioner would like Kaira to remain in Saskatchewan and have regular contact with each parent on alternating weeks. HELD: 1) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The Court cannot determine on conflicting affidavits what the primary parent status quo is. 2) It is in the best interest that the child see both parents. There was a similar course in Saskatoon that the respondent could have taken which would have made more frequent changes possible, but her affidavit indicates she thinks the Saskatoon course is inferior to the one she is taking in Victoria. 3) Pending trial the child shall be parented by the petitioner for 28 days, and thereafter by the respondent for 28 days and such parenting shall continue to alternate for each 28 day period thereafter until further order. The costs of transportation shall be born primarily by the respondent.","FIAT: This is an application to determine interim parenting for the child. There is conflicting affidavit evidence respecting the nature and extent of the father's parenting duties while the parties lived together. The mother, Lesly, has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child with her. The issues of parenting and mobility are clearly unresolved and may go to trial. HELD: 1) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The primary parent status quo is Lesly. Lesly has chosen not to take school in Victoria but that does not mean that even if Lesly is theprimary parent that the child will continue to live in Regina or that she will have regular contact with each parent alternating each week. However it is fair that Lesly contribute something to this cost. 2) Lesly shall pay for each occasion that Kairsa travels to Victoria for parenting time with Lesly but only for the trip from Regina to Victoria. 3) Costs in the cause are in the amount of $10,000."
2009skqb445.txt,"The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances. The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","The accused is facing a 24 count indictment generally associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances and matters ancillary thereto. This motion, under s.7, 11(d) and 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, is for an order that the accused be provided with full disclosure in useable format. The issues are whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided; and whether the format of disclosure was appropriate. HELD: 1) The accused is entitled to hard copies of all documents filed by the defence. Given the nature of the organization of the data by the Crown, the cost of obtaining the police officers' notebooks in full, in chronological order for pre-trial examination and trial cross-examination is significant. However, the day will come when the ability to operate personal computers and retrieve data stored on computer disks and related media by means of software programs designed for general public use will be core competency requirement for counsel who wish to act in cases involving voluminous amounts of data. It appears that that day has come. The disclosure provided to date has been reasonably accessible and in a reasonably accessible manner. It is appropriate to embark upon a Laporte inquiry and make the appropriate order on the materials filed. 2) There is no need for the Crown to provide copies of any officers’ notebooks in hard copy and chronological order that postdates the laying of the charges or the issuance of search warrants, whichever is dated later. In this case, the Crown should provide hard copy of the notes made by police officers in their notebooks. The notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in a hard copy in a fashion that is reasonably accessible. In some cases, it would be by way of electronic disclosure or, in some situations, combination of the two. There is the skill, sophistication and equipment to access the electronic data. 3) In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided thus far is appropriate in that it has been providing in a reasonable accessible manner that does not detract from the right of the defence to make full answer."
2009skqb506.txt,"The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession. The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","The landlord appealed a decision of the hearing officer of the Residential Tenancies Office. The hearing officer found that she did not have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter and the landlord appealed. Appeal dismissed; the notice to vacate was served on the landlord. The landlord alleged that the Hearing Officer erred in law by failing to make an order for possession of the rental unit. The tenant sought an Order for Possession pursuant to s. 70 of the residential Tenancies Act, 2006. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The hearing officer made no error in law in finding that there was no valid tenancy agreement between the landlord and the tenant.  2)The Act applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. 3)The tenants had entered a written tenancy agreement in good faith. There was no breach of trust by either party.  4)The tenancy agreement was invalid because the landlord did not provide sufficient notice to the tenant as required by s.7(f)(i) and s.8(f) of the terms of the agreement. 5)The Hearing Officer did not err in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 6)The tenant was not prejudiced."
2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.",HELD: The application was dismissed. It was clear that the respondent had not proven that he was a person of sufficient interest. The court found that the petitioner had not demonstrated that he had a sufficient interest to bring this application forward.
2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The charges relate to events which occurred between April 8 and April 14, 2010 respectively. The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases: to allow three separate trials in all; and to separate for trial all of the so-called status offences. The only possible link conceded is the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the gun on both days. In the final analysis, the Court would be better served to order the accused to testify on one or more of the counts rather than the others."
2_1999canlii12669.txt,"The respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support. The parties were married in January 1991 with three children and ceased to cohabit in December of 1996. The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT. The respondent sought an order for interim spousal support. HELD: The Court concluded that relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of maintenance. Section of land owned by the petitioner was valued at $293,874. The difference in value relates to a section of land which the respondent brought into the marriage. The petitioner's share of the 1998 crop has value of $16,000. The fact remains that the respondent is in the position of not being able to obtain suitable shelter on his own and that is deplorable. The Court ordered the respondent to pay $500 per month. In the alternative, the petitioner should receive half of his income from the sale of an off-setting asset which could be sold and reduced loan payments would result. The $10,000 should be paid to the respondent by monthly payments in the amount of $500. The remaining monies should be left to the petitioner with no obligation to make the indicated payments."
2_2010skpc149.txt,"The accused were both charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","The two accused were charged on separate informations with assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and with wilfully damaging the windows of a car. HELD: The accused were found not guilty of the first count on information 24414281.  1) The physical altercation in this case was precipitated by jealousy or by a drug deal gone bad. There is no doubt that the accused were the aggressors throughout. He smashed in one, if not two, car windows. He chased after the complainant with Dagenais' help. Once at the trailer he rushed up the stairs toward the complainant. This was threatening behaviour and the complainant said he felt threatened. 2) The accused admitted to hitting the complainant three times in the face. He admitted to breaking the front passenger window of the car. 3) The Court found the accused not guilty on the second count of wilful damage to the windows. The accused both admitted to getting into the car and breaking the rear window. The Crown and the defence testified that they were driving down the street when the altercation occurred. The second count was based upon the same incident.  4) There was no evidence of any essential element of the offence.  5) Corfmat was not cross-examined. He agreed that the charges all arose out of the same event and that the Crown and defence would be allowed to call all of their evidence at the trial on one information, which would all be applied over to the other information. The Court agreed that this procedure. The trial proceeded on the information 24415281. 6) The court found that the two accuseds were clearly the main aggressors. They attacked the complainant and punched and kicked him until he fell off the stairs and onto the ground. 7) The evidence was admitted to all of the accuseds at the hearing.  8) The complainant's injuries would have been far more severe if this had actually happened and the Crown was unable to prove the cost of repairing the windows under $5,000.  9) The medical evidence was not examined.  10) The injuries were not consistent with the actions taken by the accused. They were aggressive and the defendant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family.  11) The actions of both accusedes were aggressive.

2_2010skqb402.txt,"The defendant applied for dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution. The claim was issued November 1, 1999 and is based in debt for goods and services provided to the defendant. The value of the claim is $521,283.99 and refers to provision of materials, products and services in 1995 and 1996. The statement of defence was filed November 12, 1999 and amended in 2002. In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary. A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48. In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided. Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance. Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial. The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action. The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied.","The respondent applies for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The respondent responds through its counsel that it now has every intention to diligently proceed with its action. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's delay in advancing the cause was inordinate and legally inexcusable. Although the respondent had undertaken extensive communications with the other parties regarding the alleged payment by Ochapowace to Ochampowace, it now appears that the respondent has undertaken its own due diligence in pursuing the cause. 2) It is in the interests of justice that the plaintiff be permitted to pursue its claim. All parties are cautioned to now proceed diligently and without delay. Failure to do so will no doubt cause the defendant to consider making a further application for dismissal. 3) The application for an order returning the $40,000 paid by the respondent to McDiarmid is not a relief which can be granted at this time. The question of whether or not settlement was reached, the circumstances under which this payment was made were live issues raised by the pleadings. This is an issue that must be determined by the trial judge.  4) The Court reviewed all the relevant facts, which it considered appropriate to the Carey case approach, and found that this was not a case where the application should be granted. 5) The delay in the conduct of the respondent in relation to the payment of $100,000 (the plaintiff's sues for payment) had been inordinate.  6) Counsel for the respondent, who had conducted extensive examinations for the plaintiff throughout the course of the action, was not blameless in his contribution to the delay. The applicant, either because it considered the matter settled or because it was content to wait for the case to go away, to do nothing to encourage a more timely disposition of it until 2009, when the requested undertakings were sent to the plaintiff. Counsel for respondent also declined to answer questions as to the respondent's involvement with the proceedings. 7) The onus is on the plaintiff to establish that the delay in pursuing its claim is excusable and that the evidence sufficiently advanced to warrant an order for the return of the sought after undertakings.  8) Costs awarded on a party/party basis."
2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","This was a divorce proceeding and the parties were in a shared parenting regime. The mother sought custody and primary care of the children, while the father was a regular user of marijuana and alcohol. The father felt that since he was paying a proportionally greater share of the day to day care expenses, the mother would have no reason to develop a better relationship with him. No division was made of pre-marital pension benefits. The evidence showed that the father had not always been as respectful of the mother and appreciated her assistance with homework. HELD: The court found that the information provided by the father and his witnesses was credible. The information concerning the mother's role in parenting was corroborated by the evidence provided by her witnesses. The court ordered ongoing and retroactive child support. There was no presumption in favour of reducing the parent's child support obligation to a level that is consistent with today's society. The child support table was to come into effect January 2012."
2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused pled guilty to assaulting a peace officer with a weapon. The offence was a serious personal injury offence as defined by s.752. It occurred when the officer first received information that the accused had a warrant for his residence and the accused began to run away from the officer. The officer fired his taser at the accused, striking him in the head. At the time of the offence, the accused was in his room with a female commissionaire and he was trying to break free of the taser wires when he was cornered by the officer and the police. At trial, defence counsel submitted the accused picked up a weapon at the officer, coming so close to the officer that it caused him to back away and pull his sidearm. Defence counsel suggested that a penitentiary sentence was warranted given the accused's record of 58 Criminal Code convictions, Fifteen of which are for violent offences, six of which relate to peace officers. The Crown alleged the accused engaged in conduct endangering or likely to endanger the life or safety of either officer. HELD: The accused was sentenced to a term of 10 years for the offences of assault and one year for common assault. The sentence was increased to 12 years for each subsequent offence under s.786(1)(a)(ii) and for a further term of ten years because the accused now had a weapon of that type in his possession and used it in an intimidating manner. The Court found that given the Crown’s case and the fact that the offences were committed within a short time span, the prospect of the accused being found to be dangerous or long-term offender was low. The court found that it would be inappropriate to require additional evidence at this stage of the proceedings in order to determine whether there were reasonable grounds to believe that the offender might be a dangerous person."
3_1995canlii4402.txt,"The respondent expropriated a parcel of land owned by the appellant. Prior to a hearing, all claims for the case were settled for the sum of $20,000. The appellant's solicitor presented solicitor and client accounts of $19,420 plus taxes. The respondent directed taxation, and the appellant's solicitor submitted further accounts for services and disbursements of the taxation hearing amounting to $7,212.24. The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000. He proceeded to tax the account at $14,000, disallowed any costs of the taxation hearing, and disallowed a claim for interest on interim accounts submitted by the solicitor. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal and confirming the taxation, that the taxing master did not make any errors in law. He was entitled to consider as one of the relevant factors the relationship of the total account to the recovery.","The expropriation of land in 1993 by the City Council passed a resolution to expropriate it for the purpose of widening the Bedford Highway. The land was approximately 10 feet of the 30-foot rear yard for retaining wall. The construction of the retaining wall began in February 1994 with the work beginning in June 1994. In October 1994, the City council approved the abandonment of the land retaining only an easement necessary for the footing. The solicitor for the Tannous rendered a solicitor-client account to the City in the amount of $19,420 plus taxes representing approximately 100 hours time spent on the file. In March 1995, notice and statement of claim was filed by the claimant with the Utility and Review Board under the Expropriation Act. At the taxation hearing in August 1995, the taxing master reduced the account to $14,000 plus taxes. The appellants suggest the Master disallowed any services that were actually incurred, but in the absence of evidence clearly establishing an entitlement to interest on default of payment, it is not recoverable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the taxation of costs by the Master were confirmed. 1)The failure of the City to include an item of compensation for injurious affection did not render the offer of full compensation for interest for interest. 2)There was no evidence clearly established that the services, although actual incurred, were not reasonable in all the circumstances. 3)The mere statement of an interest term on an invoice by itself raises no legal obligation for payment of such costs. The protection given by s.13(2) and (3) and 4) shall not extend to any person whose land is money or investment and not a family home."
3_1995canlii6053.txt,"The accused was charged with failing to appear at his trial on a charge of impaired driving. The impaired driving charge was subsequently stayed. When the charge of failing to appear came on for trial the accused claimed a 'lawful excuse' for his failure to appear on the impaired driving charge. His excuse was that the next shift at work had failed to arrive on time and that this had made it impossible for him to get to court on time. This excuse was rejected and he was convicted. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Whether an accused has a lawful excuse is determined with reference to common law principles. It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.","The accused sought to overturn his conviction for failing to attend court by arguing that the trial judge ought to have accepted his excuse for not appearing. At issue was whether the accused advanced a 'lawful excuse' for not attending court. HELD: The trial judge rejected the accused's submission that he had a 'lawsful excuse'. 1)The Crown had stayed the original impaired driving charge against the accused, which was stayed by the Crown. 2)The accused had indicated he would be retaining a lawyer. The Crown had refused to stay the original charge. 3)The trial judge abandoned her reasoned decision rejecting the submission that the accused had an 'impaired driving offence' by the appellant. 4)The only conclusion drawn was that the appellant had abandoned all of the defences the common law considers a sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 5)The lawful excuse was not supported by the evidence, the proper guidelines for the development of a proper defence were abandoned and the appeal against the conviction was dismissed."
3_1997canlii11217.txt,"Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them. The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996. The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","The petitioner brothers were three brothers from the District of Perdue, Saskatchewan who carried on a family farm operation and operated a farm implement dealership business. In 1985, the accountant for the petitioner firm recommended that they become involved in certain real estate partnerships in order to derive certain tax advantages. The petitioner accountant, who had advised the petitionerers that they should become involved, found that the petitioner had ceased to meet his liabilities generally as they become due and thus, commenced an act of bankruptcy within six months of the petitioner's filing. HELD: The Court ordered the petitioner to submit to cross-examination on his affidavit and notice disputing the petition and to receive an order pursuant to the 1985 Shareholder's Agreement whereby partners called upon to make advances on behalf of their defaulting partners are entitled to recover those amounts as debts owing to them by the defaulting partner. 1)There was no extenuating circumstance which would warrant the Court refusing to grant a receiving order.  2)The petitioner was awealthy individual who was quite capable of paying his debts but had simply chosen not to do so. He earned over $1.4 million in his last four years as a professional hockey player and had saved a total of $108,625.65 in personal tax liability. He expected to derive tax advantages from being involved in these two partnerships. He claimed business losses of $50,286.77 as a result of his involvement in them. 3)The material discloses the very substantial financial hardships visited upon the petitioner as result of the refusal to pay the indebtedness owed by him. The individual members of the Petitioners have been paying their respective shares of capital contributions to the partnership. The Court found that it was Appropriate for the Bankruptcy Court to Grant the Receiving Order."

The father would have access on alternating weekends and for a three hour period one weekday provided the child was returned by the bedtime set by the mother. Although both parents genuinely love the child and were equally competent caregivers, neither demonstrated that sole parenting offered an advantage to him. Both had full time jobs. 2)When the mother assumes sole custody the father must pay child support of $226 per month and proportionate share of horse riding lessons ($28 per month).","FIAT. Both parents wanted sole custody of their son. Since they separated in June of 1997, the boy had lived alternating weeks with each parent.

The mother's obligation to make herself available for full-time child care was to commence on the first day of the month following the time that the mother makes herself available. 1)The mother had plans to marry her current companion when they were divorced. She planned to stay at home and be the primary caregiver of the child. She was willing to have generous access to her father. 2)The present shared parenting arrangement was to continue.

3_2002skca56.txt,"A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services). The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order. It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date.","The appellant appealed a decision of the Board of Inquiry appointed by the Minister of Justice under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code which found that the appellant continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services to wheelchair users and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet the accessibility requirements of the National Building Code of Canada 1995.[1] The appellant appeals contending that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order that it did. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order, an order in which it had retained jurisdiction, to confirm compliance with the order and which had been confirmed by this Court. The extent of the order, that is whether it was confined to external access of the property or to other 'facilities and services' and whether it had been complied with is the very question the Board reserved jurisdiction to determine."
3_2003canlii64101.txt,"The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction. No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties. The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel. Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed. The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial. When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act. When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date.","The child protection proceeding in respect of the child who was under the age of six when taken into care was delayed for a number of reasons. The primary child protection concerns that were advanced by the agency were such that the original agency planning for the reunification of the mother and child required some psychological counselling. Counsel for the mother made a motion that based on the rule in B.F. I had lost my jurisdiction and must dismiss the matter. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)The time limit preceded the disposition order and the trial date is after the outside disposition date provided in the Act. 2)The trial date was near the outside deadline. There was good reason for the matter to be extended for a trial beyond the date of the overall deadline. 3)Apprehension will expose the child to the very delay the deadlines are designed to avoid since each of the stages set out in the act (interim hearing, protection finding and at least one disposition hearing) will have to run their course, in the absence of consent to consolidation under s40(2) of the act. 4)Any attempt after the trial to make a continued intervention order of any type would not be in a child's best interests. 5)The Court had not lost its jurisdiction in this matter and the matter will commence tomorrow."

HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack. The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As stated in McCallum, the fact that the effects of alcohol may have been exacerbated by the accused suffering from fatigue does not provide a defence to the charge.","The accused was charged with having the care or control of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate it was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The accused's evidence which was to the effect that he was suffering from a panic attack, raised a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The accused had been diagnosed as suffering from generalized anxiety disorder (G.A.D.). The symptoms of impairment displayed by him were the manifestations of his panic attack not from the consumption of alcohol. 2)The medical evidence did not support the accused's diagnosis of either impairment by alcohol nor from his evidence concerning the possibility of him being in such an attack.  3)The court found with respect to the following issues: 1)Had the accused been in the driver's seat of a pick up truck the accused would have been found guilty of driving over the legal limit. He would not have been driving over that distance.

The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim. The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674. HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. 2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. 4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.","The applicant sought an order by way of certiorari pursuant to Rule 664 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court, to quash the decision of the Workers' Compensation Board which denied the applicant's application for benefits based upon its finding that the deceased spouse was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers’ Compensation Act. The applicant had become aware of the potential benefits in early July 2001 during a casual conversation at her workplace and suggested that her husband had been performing work duties while on campus to attend class or to study that there might be an entitlement to benefits.

The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years. The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5) Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794. His income is considerably higher now. His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","The respondent father applied to vary an order made May 14, 2002 for child support payable to the petitioner mother on behalf of his two youngest children, Michael, born March 15, 1990, and Jessica, born December 30, 1991. Although the agreement stipulated that he live with his maternal grandmother, the mother paid his father's expenses, including fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating. The current s. 7 expenses total $4,261. The father is to pay support in the amount of $1,486.00 per month for as long as they remain children within the meaning of the Divorce Act. In this case, Michael began living with his mother at least 40% of the time in September 2006. This ended in January or February 2007, which is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter, he resumed living with the grandmother and was supported by his mother. HELD: 1)The parties were not able to speak to one another, notwithstanding the difficulty it undoubtedly caused their children. 2)The father was to pay child support in accordance with the applicable table. 3)The mother's income was $25,672.37. She received an allowance from her estranged husband for $2,000 a month. 4)The orthodontic work needed by the mother and the medical/dental fees not covered by the father's employer's insurer fell within s.7. 5)Costs were awarded to the mother for the trial. 6)The court was satisfied that the parties were responsible for their proportionate share of expenses according to their income. 7)The amount of child support ordered for trial must be determined by taking into account (a) the increased costs associated with the shared custody arrangements; and (c) the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of each parent and children for whom support is sought. 8)The onus is on the parent wishing to invoke the operation of s. to demonstrate to the court's satisfaction that a shared custody arrangement as contemplated by s. is in fact in place, and has been in place for, or will be in place over a course of year. While it is not necessary that there be in all circumstances written or commissioned by the parties, the Court is satisfied that from September 2006 until, approximately, February, 2007, the parties shared custody of the child. The parties agreed that this was an appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for."
4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT: The respondent applied for an interim order granting sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s. 7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, October 2005. The petitioner requested joint custody with specified access. The respondent acknowledged an obligation to pay child support and there was an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive. HELD: 1) Retroactive child support was granted. There was nothing in the evidence that rebutted that presumption on an interim basis. The purpose of interim orders is to establish temporary parenting arrangements pending a trial or final resolution of the matter. 2) The company in issue is in its startup phase. There is insufficient evidence to establish what cash is available and whether it could be withdrawn without impeding the financial viability of the company. 3) The current interim order for child support arrears is $8,107 payable on a monthly basis. 4) The petitioner's Line 150 income is $86,870.57. It is common for support provisions to be based on the prior year's earnings. 5) Changes in child support were discussed between the parties prior to March 2006. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 1, 2006 is warranted. 6) The Court ordered that the respondent continue to pay $185 per month directly to the child care provider which represents one-half of the current child care costs (before tax considerations) for employment purposes. 7) The respondent was not prepared to vary the terms of the agreement."
4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The offender pled guilty at the opening of trial to distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The offender had 1,200 postings on the website, which included 11 stories that were the subject of the charge. The site encouraged stories, and the offender encouraged others to submit stories. HELD: The offender was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years, as well as the addition of an order requiring him to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, 2004 for a period of 20 years. The terms of the three-year probation order were as follows: 1) Keep the peace; be of good behaviour; 2) Appear before the court when required to do so by the court; Report to supervisor within two working days from the date of release from jail and thereafter continue to report as directed by the supervisor. 2) Denunciation and deterrence are the dominant principles of sentencing and the Crown submitted the offender did not know that writings do not stimulate the demand for images that do directly harm children; 3) Perform some form of counselling through mental health services. 4) Perform one-to-one sessions with a therapist or psychiatrist. 5) Consider it appropriate to make an order pursuant to ss. 161(1) prohibiting you from attending public park or public swimming area where persons under the age of fourteen are present or can reasonably be expected to be present in a daycare centre, schoolground, playground or community centre; 6) The offender would be required to participate in psycho forensic psychiatric/psychological evolution which may be beneficial in attempting to understand/treat this behaviour."
4_2009skca102.txt,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","The Crown appealed a sentence of 26 months in pre-trial custody and 2 years probation imposed following the death of their 7-month-old daughter. The respondent had been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and her previous criminal record included convictions for possession of a weapon and mischief (which resulted in the offence leading to the charge). The Crown alleged the sentencing judge overemphasized the mitigating factors such as the mother's remorse, her abusive background, and her social and economic situation. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis of this latter ground. The sentencing judge did not give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability ultimately failed. The court found as aggravating factors the respondent had a higher general criminal recidivism risk than the respondent, her extreme poverty and her history of mental health problems. These factors led to a reduction in sentence to four years, which the Crown sought to remedy. The Court noted in R. v. Schoenthal that post-traumatic stress disorder is a serious and life-threatening condition and the sentence imposed was appropriate because of the high risk of re-offence and because the child had been exposed to drug use, domestic abuse and sexual abuse. The issues were considered and given appropriate weight by the sentencing court. The appellant was granted leave to appeal."
4_2011nssc71.txt,"The judge declared the defendants could pay legal fees from third party loans without offending two prior execution orders that prevented them from disposing of any property. The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets. Later, the defendants' counsel wrote to the court essentially indicating he could not confirm the loans would not be secured against any assets. The court issued this supplemental decision. In the absence of any evidence the loans will not be secured against assets already subject to the execution order, or will not otherwise reduce those assets, the order and declaration sought can no longer be granted.","The defendants sought an order confirming their ability to pay certain amounts for billed and unbilled time without violating the terms of two execution orders previously issued against them, as Hfx No. 190408 against the judgment debtors to the plaintiff and the defendants, who were successful litigants in this action. HELD: The defendants were ordered to pay the retainers and legal fees referred to in the decision. The court was unable to grant the order that accompanied the notice in the matter. It was requested that submissions in writing on the matter of costs, failing which, the court could not grant the proposed order."
4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","In October 2014, Turcotte J. ordered the defendant to pay retroactive child support for a period of time varying from January 2009 to August 2012 inclusive. The parties had agreed in May 2011 to fix support by varying the 2011 Variation Order. In September 2012, the defendant abandoned his request to change the primary residence of his former spouse to a different residence and applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for an order varying the amount of child support payable by the parties. The defendant successfully applied for and was granted arrears on the basis of his income tax returns, tax returns and property statements. He successfully passed his probationary period and prospects for continued employment were good. In 2012, he applied to vary the 2006 Variation order which he alleged was a final order made pursuant to the terms of the 2006 Consent Child Support Order. He failed to do so. In 2014, he filed an application for variation of the variation order. In this application, he argued that the court drew a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held that it had not been asked to overrule Frey and that it did not rely on common law principles. Whether the Court can vary an interim or final order on a interim basis for child support is governed by the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, c 3d Supp. The jurisprudence taking different approach predates the Supreme Court of Canada's explication of the proper method of statutory interpretation. Following the modern approach to statutory interpretation, the words of provision must be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the act and the intention of Parliament. The law requires the parties to exchange financial information and to endeavour to adjust from year to year such that an adjustment should be made as of particular date, that issue does not arise in this appeal."
5_1994canlii4866.txt,"The Plaintiff's 1989 Ford F150 1/2 ton truck caught fire and burned in his garage. This model of truck was subject to a recall by Ford to correct a fuel line defect. The Plaintiff called several expert witnesses who testified that, in their opinion, the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire. Ford called one witness who was the designer of of the truck's fuel system and a Ford employee. He testified that the defective fuel line could not have leaked sufficient fuel to cause the fire. He also admitted, however, that his prior written report contained errors. Rebuttal evidence called by the Plaintiff indicated that the check valve in the fuel pump designed to prevent siphoning from the fuel tank in the event of a leaking fuel line did not operate as the Ford witness had testified. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff had proved on a balance of probabilities that the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire. The Plaintiff's experts' evidence was accepted over that of the Ford expert. No independent experts had been called by Ford.","The plaintiffs claim against Ford for damages from a fire in their garage which they allege was caused by combustion of vapours from gasoline leakage from the fuel tube of a new truck they purchased from Ford. The action against Country Plaza was discontinued. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs' theory as to how the fire started was proven was accurate. Based on the initial recall notice, they concluded that an electric static discharge through the U-shaped fuel tube in the truck was the cause of the fire. 2)Because of extreme cold weather conditions the electrical insulating qualities of the nylon fuel line were reduced to an extent that the vapours would likely collect in the attic, the area underneath the truck where the gasoline was pooled and then flash back to the vehicle where it was ignited. 3)The subsequent recall notice deleted any reference to off-road driving. 4)The plaintiff never called any independent witnesses on their behalf and their only witness was an employee of Ford."
5_1995canlii4187.txt,"This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).","The appellant contended the trial judge erred in law by applying the doctrine of recent possession mainly because there was no evidence that he was in recent possession of the stolen Chevrolet Blazer. Dismissing the appeal, that although the evidence was circumstantial, the facts he found to be proved led to no other reasonable inference than the guilt of the appellant. The appellant ran from the vehicle and made the tracks in the snow which were followed by the police. The time periods for each and all of these events were consistent with his findings of fact."
5_1998canlii13955.txt,"An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits. The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","The respondent SGI terminated the respondent's benefits pursuant to s.185 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The respondent claimed that the benefits were terminated because the respondent was not able to perform some of his farm duties and because he was unable to pay his partial income replacement benefit. The applicant applied to the Court for an order setting aside such termination. HELD: SGI's termination was appropriate. The court found that SGI was not entitled to terminate the benefits under s. 185(d), (e), (f) or (g) of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations. It was not prepared to find that the respondent caused his early discharge from the Yorkton Physiotherapy Secondary Treatment Centre or failed, without valid reason, to fail, without a valid reason to attend his scheduled assessment in Wascana. SGI shall therefore pay the difference, if any, between the amount paid for the period September 24 to October 23, 1997 and the amount required to be paid pursuant to the judgment for the commencement of his employment in Alberta.

5_2000canlii3680.txt,"After being sexually assaulted, applicant was voluntarily released from Canadian Armed Forces. She applied for and was denied a pension. Civil proceedings were commenced and the Crown defended on the basis that before initiating civil proceedings, applicant was obliged to appeal denial of pension or seek review by Minister of pension rejection. Applicant applied to strike out that portion of defence application allowed. The applicant applied for and was denied a pension. Therefore no pension was at this time payable to her. A review by the Minister would require new information and the appeal period had expired. The applicant should not be denied her right to proceed against the Crown in such circumstances.","The plaintiff was voluntarily released from the military and applied for a pension. The Minister of Defence later reversed the decision and the plaintiff was barred from bringing an action for damages against the government claiming that she was wrongly or arbitrarily released. In this action, the Crown brought an application to strike the plaintiff's statement of claim on the basis it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The defence of the Crown in part argued that the plaintiff had not exhausted the grievance procedure provided under the Pensions Act or the Queen's Regulations and Orders, nor had she pursued the administrative process in favour of pursuing the civil action. Arguing that the Crown has not met the onus on proving that a pension is payable and that, in the alternative, a decision to bar the plaintiff from bringing such an action could only be made in light of s. 111 of the Pension Act and s. 2 of the Liability and Proceedings Act. The Crown took the position that to interpret the section as imposing an obligation on the employee to apply for pension, and further obligation upon him to prove that pension is not payable, would require the plaintiff to read into the legislation concepts which are both unexpressed and unreasonable. The plaintiff failed to bring this proceeding because she failed to appeal in time. It was inconceivable that having been denied the application for pension by the government for sexual assault the plaintiff is now precluded from bringing this proceeding. Furthermore, the limitation period for appealing the Minister's decision had expired under the pension act. To interpret the s. 11(1) of the Act (and s. 8) (where pension is or may be awarded) as a bar to the proceedings has been considered by the courts in various contexts and is applicable to the present instance."
5_2001skqb463.txt,"This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required. The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.","The two contracts that play in this case are the contract between the City of Regina and Triple P Holdings operated by the defendants and the same two defendants. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the City, the general thrust of all of the evidence was that certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to the members of the Independent Truckers Association. The plaintiffs failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged on that breach and that any breach occurred. HELD: Each case was dismissed. 1)The plaintiffs had constructed their cases in reliance upon the overall affect of both contracts with specific emphasis on the contract of January 1997. The factual evidence was in conflict but found that the defendants made some effort to include the plaintiffs in the rotation. Problematically, for the plaintiffs, there is no contractual obligation in the agreement of January 21, 1997 which requires the defendants to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract goes on to specify the contractors obligations to pay in the event of a breach.  2)The issue of privity of contract could have been a critical issue in different circumstances but in the end this case will not turn on the question of adequity. 3)The case will look to see if the plaintiffs have made out the case that they have constructed. The single issue is overwhelmed by the larger issue as to what really is the contract alleged to have been breached. If the plaintiffs had intended to present the case the contract was the whole arrangement between the city, the Association, the contractor and the truckers, they would have had to draw in all the parties, including the trucking association and the city of Regina as well as all the related documents. 4)Costs claimed by the plaintiffs are excessive and do not properly take into account: Actual operating expenses for the time complained about; (b)the net affect of mitigating factors; and (c)a reliable calculation of the administration of rotation of the work. 5)Even if the case on entitlement had been made out, the plaintiffs could have had a different issue to decide the case as presented. In the end, this case is incumbent upon them to deal with findings as to damages."

He appealed the dismissal of his application in March 2000 to vary the support order by suspending payment until he gained employment and by reducing arrears. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part. He must obtain employment when his health allows. Arrears were reduced to $5,000 and enforcement was stayed so long as he continues to make monthly payments of $30 to Maintenance Enforcement.","The parties divorced in 1992 and the appellant was ordered to pay $200 monthly support.

5_2003skpc19.txt,At issue in the negligence suit was whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff's vehicle in front of him and stopped his vehicle to avoid the motor vehicle collision. The only material difference in testimonies was whether there was a half-ton truck in front of the plaintiff's vehicle when the collision occurred. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was not proven on a balance of probabilities. The physical evidence did not assist and the court was unable to conclude that one version was correct and the other incorrect.,"An action in negligence arising out of a vehicle accident. A tractor-trailer slowly inched up to a car driven by the plaintiff and nudged it causing damage to the back bumper of the plaintiff's vehicle and some damage on the trunk lid of the vehicle. The ultimate disagreement was over the issue of whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff’s vehicle in front of him and therefore, stopped his vehicle thus avoiding the collision. The plaintiff and his wife testified at trial about the blind spots that exist for tractor trailer drivers. The defendant testified that there were no other vehicles in the intersection at the time of the collision; the driver of the tractor said he saw a half-ton truck in frontof his vehicle shortly before the accident. HELD: 1)The evidence was not dispositive of either version of the facts. The physical evidence did not assist the court in reaching a determination regarding the issues of negligence and legal liability. 2)The plaintiff was not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his claim had been proven.  3)It was not equivocal as the plaintiff testified that he passed another vehicle that must be in front or that his tractor unit was nudging another vehicle. 4)The court was unable to conclude that one version of facts was correct and the other was incorrect. Each version contains an equally rational explanation for what transpired on the date in question."
5_2004skca60.txt,"The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of the Municipal Board Act. The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply abnormal obsolescence to the owner's property. The issues also relate to 15 other properties and as the issues are the same for each property they were decided by the Assessment Appeals Committee on one appeal. The Assessment Appeals Committee dismissed the appeals, finding the issue not to be a matter of the Assessor's Discretion but a matter of professional interpretation of data. The Committee found the Board of Revision did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err on the issue of abnormal obsolescence for size. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted on two questions of law.  1) Did the Committee err in its interpretation and application of the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual by failing to find that economic obsolescence for size must be categorized on a MAF by MAF basis? 2) Did the Committee err by failing to find the Assessor should have used the comparable unit method to determine whether an adjustment for obsolescence for size should be applied to the applicant's property? 3) On the use of invalid sales leave was denied on the basis the question of the sale is a question of fact and in argument the applicant said for its purposes the impugned sale did not matter. 4) Leave to appeal was denied on the issue of the standard of proof that there was no error demonstrated.","The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The issue is the use of invalid sales and the alleged improper onus or standard of proof. The sale was impugned and the question of the sale did not matter. The Assessor determined the specific MAF neighbourhoods based on industrial property sales. However, in determining the existence of abnormal obsolescence for size the Assessor worked on the basis of aggregated sales from different MAF neighborhoods. The Committee did not view the matter as one of assessor discretion but saw it as a matter of professional interpretation of data. At the outset the door may still be opened but the key to opening it is a demonstrable case of concrete and material failure, particularly as it may relate to the general, though not necessarily so confined. The key certainly does not lie in speculative, abstract, or harmless failures of process related to the particular. No error has been demonstrated and no law arises. The onus of establishing the ground is on the appellant."

The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act. HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant. The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing. Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act setting aside the plaintiff's pre-judgment garnishee in which $2,291.90 was paid into Court from the defendant's bank account at Biggar and District Credit Union on December 7, 2005. The issue was whether the claim was a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act and if so, whether the affidavit of the plaintiff filed in support of the issuance of both the garnishees complies with s.3(2). HELD: The application was dismissed with fixed costs. 1)Prejudgment Garnishee is an extraordinary remedy and failure to strictly comply with the provisions of the act goes to jurisdiction. 2)The affidavits filed by the applicant and the affidavit by the plaintiff satisfied the criteria set out in the Act. 3)The affidavit was a complete and accurate representation of the amount owing on the judgment in the amount of $24,155.94.  4)The plaintiff failed to meet the four purposes of the affidavit filed pursuant to the Act as outlined by Baynton J. in Conexus. 5.5 The Court was not to consider any of the potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishhee summons."
5_2006nsca41.txt,"The plaintiff company commenced an action against a former employee/shareholder for breach of fiduciary and employee duty. The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company. The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action. The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","Electric, a closely held company, applied for an order permitting the appellant to withdraw the admissions and add a claim for an 'oppression remedy' pursuant to s. 5.03 of the Companies Act and for leave to apply for the amendment to the admissions. The appellant argued the judge erred in permitting the admissions to be withdrawn because he misinterpreted the effect of the April 2004 consent order, which alleged that Oickle surreptitiously competed against the company during his employment, appropriated opportunities that would have been available to the company, and misused company resources to support his competition. The appellants sought declaratory and injunctive relief to give effect to Oickle's motion to withdraw his admissions. Oickle appealed the order permitting him to commence a derivative action. Dismissing the appeal, that the judge did not apply a wrong principle or make an unjust order. The only difference between the two lines of cases is that one of semantics not substance, relying on Tymkin v. Winnipeg (City) Police Service, [2003] M.J. No. 284, 20. Instead, the court takes issue with the result reached by the judge. The judge applied the less restrictive test approved in Abacus which allows the application of a common law principle to a judicial admission. The common law principles of analogy and fact-finding apply here as well as in the case of Oickle, who was only a shareholder from October 1985 to July 1986. The parties intended to provide a retroactive suspension of the admissions but the judge allowed them to be allowed to withdraw. In this case, the appellants were seeking an order for an audit of affairs of the company pertinent to both the appellant and the defendant. In addition to the usual and ordinary course, the parties had reached an agreement whereby the appellant could commence derivative action against the defendant based on the same premises as Oickle. The Court granted leave to appeal on this ground."
5_2006nssc43.txt,"The plaintiff alleged that a small piece of metal seen dangling from beneath the defendant's tractor trailer flew out from under the trailer as it passed the plaintiff's vehicle and hit her engine hood, bounced in the open window and caused her to lose control of her vehicle. She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control. The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled. Application for summary judgment granted; the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success. The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge.","The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright when a tractor-trailer passed her vehicle. She alleged that a piece of metal fell off of his vehicle, fell to the pavement, bounced on to the engine bonnet of her vehicle and hit the windshield of the plaintiff's vehicle. The plaintiff claimed damages for injuries to her arms, shoulders and neck. The defendant engaged two experts to examine the vehicle and reported that the piece had not been part of it. The experts concluded that the vehicle was well maintained and that the dust shield was painted which is the usual method used by the automotive industry to protect against corrosion. The expert reports filed by the defendant remained uncontradicted. The claim for property damage to the sunroof and damages to the roof of the vehicle on the application were based upon the allegation that a large piece of rock flew from between the rear tires of the trailer and struck the plaintiff vehicle. Although there was no genuine issue for trial, the plaintiff met the threshold test of demonstrating that the claim had a real chance of success. The only issue to be tried was whether there was an agreement between the parties on the alleged incident and whether the claim warranted summary judgment. HELD: The defendant was found liable. 1)The claim had met the thresholds test and the onus of proof was not on the plaintiff to prove that the defendant owed her duty of care, that he should have observed a standard of care in meeting his duty, and that he breached his duty by failing to observe it. 2)The plaintiff failed to adduce evidence to support the bare allegation made in the pleadings. 3)There must be a real distinction or difference of evidence requiring the court to make a determination of credibility. 4)The experts' reports did not establish that the object that hit the plaintiff car was dangling from the defendant's tractor trailer and there was a small but significant difference in the thickness of the sheet and also in the type of coating applied to it. 5)It was not sufficient for the defendant to present only bare allegations of fact such as that his negligence caused the accident or that his breach of duty caused the damage or injury to the plaintiff.  6)Costs were not available where the plaintiff had sought indemnification or indemnification."
5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving and one count of having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol content exceeded.08 contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed food in a manner that was in excess of.08 while operating a motor vehicle. The accused cursed at the police officer and asked to get out of his car. The officer responded by calling an answering service and the accused spoke to his mother. At the scene, the accused was found alone in the vehicle with his seat belt on. An ambulance attended and police officers arrived within minutes and observed the accused in the driver's seat and with the vehicle keys in his hand. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1)The accused had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition he may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample. All of the requirements of s. 254(3) had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  2)Since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, with no risk of setting it in motion, the court found that the accused's s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way. 3)The officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. There was no other evidence that established he did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion. 4)Evidence of impairment was considered a number of relevant factors, including time and place of the accident, the vehicle's condition and the length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. 5)Statutes of fact and law enforcement are important but must clearly wait until law enforcement is important and must clearly be put on notice. The court found it was clear from the statements of defence counsel that there was no reasonable doubt the accused had de facto care or control of the vehicle for the purposes of care and control under s.258(1)(a). The totality of the evidence would lead any reasonable person to that conclusion. The Court found the accused subjectively formed the opinion that his ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.  6)The Court held that a reasonable person's right to make a demand for a blood sample of any kind was infringed."
5_2008nssc113.txt,"The mother of two boys, ages 12 and 13, applied to vary access to add a condition that the father only be allowed to drive with the boys in the HRM, on roads with a speed limit of 80km/hr and under. She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","The father applied for a change to the Corollary Relief Judgment, alleging that the mother had failed to provide adequate access and communication with his four children. The father had been denied access with his children for multiple sclerosis. He sought to have the restrictions on his use of marijuana continue in effect; an assessment of the children's health and their wishes in respect to access with their father was ordered. The mother opposed the application and requested that the matter be set aside for a further organizational pretrial. HELD: The court found that the father’s medical condition and its possible effect on his driving were not factors to be determined. The evidence established that the marijuana use was not a risk to the children and the father was not trying to alienate them from him; the concerns relating to the medical marijuana use were not new to the father; the court was not satisfied he was able to drive safely on routes that permit speeds over 80 km/h if the drive was lengthy."
5_2008skca56.txt,"The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault and using a weapon contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and s. 267(a) of the Code. He was tried by a jury, which convicted him.  He was sentenced to two years in a federal penitentiary plus two years probation. He appeals both his conviction and sentence. HELD: The appeal against conviction is dismissed.  1) When one assesses the case through the lens of the Yebes test of reasonableness, conclude that the verdict is not unreasonable. 2) The appellant's evidence is entirely correct to the circumstances of this case. The trial judge stressed the reasonable doubt standard and he concluded his charge with the direction consistent with R. v. W.(D.).  3) The charge in this case meets the standard of review and the appeal is set aside. The sentence is reduced to one that would allow the appellant to appear personally or have legal counsel represent him on his appeal of the order."

He had a previous record for non-violent offences., defendant sentenced to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment; aggravating factors included the defendant's possession and use of a handgun in an area where a number of people were close by and that a bullet had found its way into a nearby residence.","The two accused were jointly charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in relation to shootings in the early morning hours of December 10, 2006. Following a preliminary inquiry, both accused were committed to stand trial on April 4, 2008. Both remained in custody until October 29, 2008 when they were released on judicial interim release under the Adult Bail Supervision Program. In this case, the accused served approximately 17 months of pre-trial custody while on remand and he should be credited 34 months for this dead time. The offence was particularly serious because of the presence of at least 2, probably handguns being fired in an area where a number of people were close by at the after hours bar known as Vegas. Quite a few shots were fired and two persons died as result of the gunfire. The accused was acquitted of the two counts and he was not being sentenced for those offences today. The fatalities were mentioned simply to highlight what the result of indiscriminate gunfire can be. HELD: The global sentence to be imposed is one of years, months incarceration. There will be an order under s.109 prohibiting the possession of firearms, ammunition and explosives. A prohibition order will be for life, and there will be a DNA order. The sentence imposed should reflect society's abhorrence of those who decide to live by the gun and use the gun to settle disputes."
5_2011nsca46.txt,"The defendant, who was found guilty of the careless use of a firearm, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace and possession of a restricted or prohibited firearm applied for bail pending appeal. He had been found, in his residence, with a firearm licensed in Alberta but not licensed to be brought into this province or possessed here. The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work. Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction. Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions. The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","The appellant appeals his conviction for offences relating to careless use of a firearm and unlawful possession of a weapon. The appellant contended the trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of the Charter when the police entered the appellant’s condominium and failed to grant remedy as well as in finding that it was unreasonable for the appellant to take a loaded handgun to the door in all the circumstances. He also submits he complied with the terms of his release pending appeal. HELD: The appeal is granted and the sentence set out in R. v. Creelman is set aside. The grounds of appeal are weak and must be balanced in the public interest. 1) The appellant has no criminal record, substantial assets, a favourable pre-sentence report and a favourable passport. He is not a flight risk. If everyone using firearms in furtherance of other illegal activities in the province would be considerate, the accused would be released voluntarily. 2) There is no flight risk to the public. The applicant had no prior criminal record. He complied with his terms of release pending trial. The circumstances that the Crown suggest make the appellant a 'flight risk' have nothing to do with the charges he has faced or the convictions that have resulted. He has suffered credit card fraud as a result of using them elsewhere. He will be advised at least 24 hours before the time by which he must surrender into custody, in the event the appeal is adjourned or set aside, and he will be required to show cause why he should be granted bail prior to trial.  3) The applicant has no record of working in commercial or residential areas. He does not possess a gun nor does he possess a licence to possess one. He lives in a dwelling house with his cousin and her son. He possessed a number of weapons in a condominium. He owned two vehicles registered to his company and some ATVs. He travels widely in connection with his work. He suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suffers from anxiety and depression. 4) The court found that the applicant was not flight risk and that his proposed release plan met the onus on him."

The appellant had been represented at trial by experienced counsel but undertook the appeals himself. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appellant had not followed procedures that must be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving to the Court of Queen's Bench and, having failed, then appealed to this Court. He was convicted at trial on the basis of the testimony of his estranged wife and their daughter, whose accounts of what occurred were accepted by the trial judge. The trial judge found both to be credible witnesses. He also rejected the appellant's account, finding that he was not a credible witness. The appellant took the appeals himself. He contended that, in the circumstances, he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice inasmuch as he has evidence that his estranged Wife, out of a desire for revenge, had lied about what occurred. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)There is no tenable basis for allowing his appeal, setting aside his conviction, and ordering a new trial. On the facts as found by trial judge based on the judge's assessments of credibility, the conduct of the accused amounted to dangerous driving within the meaning of the applicable provisions of the Criminal Code.  2)The Court of Appeal is all of the view that there is a tenable ground for allowing the appeal, and setting aside the conviction and ordering new trial that are not supported on the facts by the court of Queen’s Bench, based, on the findings by the judge, based on, based upon, the judge”s assessment of credibility and the conductof the accused, and therefore, pursuant to the provisions of The Criminal Code, the appellant was convicted of dangerous driving."
5_2013skpc45.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the installation and monitoring of temperature monitoring equipment for its meat cutting business. The defendant monitored the temperature in the freezer and cooler at the business. The plaintiffs sued because their freezer failed and meat spoiled after a circuit breaker at the business tripped off. The defendant had received no alarm. The plaintiff asserts that the defendant breached the contract by failing to properly monitor the temperature in the freezer. HELD: The contract between the parties was solely for installation and monitoring. The contract did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the equipment at the plaintiff's business. The Court was satisfied that the defendant was monitoring the signal from the plaintiff's business on the dates in question and no alarm was received. It is not possible to say with any certainty why the defendant did not receive an alarm, but the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff was regularly having its monitoring equipment serviced or repaired. The plaintiff has not proven that the defendant breached the contract. The action is dismissed.","In 2006, Sturgis Meats entered into a contract with Gardon Securities. That contract covered both the installation of temperature monitoring equipment and the month to month monitoring by the defendant of the temperature in the freezer and cooler of this business. Even with this dispute, the defendant continues to monitor those temperatures at the business. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff. Based on the original contract between the parties and ongoing payments being made in 2010, the contract was solely for the monitoring of the temperatures in the cooler and freezer at the plaintiff and did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the monitoring equipment at that business. The monitoring equipment was in good working order and there was no glitch in the equipment. There was no breach of the contract by any of the parties."

The respondent’s solicitors filed the certificate of pending litigation after his death. The appellant transferred the land subject to the certificate of pending litigation into her name only and entered into an agreement to sell the land, which could not proceed with the certificate of pending litigation. HELD: The appeal was of sufficient merit and it was not prima facie frivolous or vexatious. The appeal, however, was not found to be of sufficient importance to the practice of law or the Court of Queen’s Bench to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal. There was no new, controversial or unusual issue of practice raised by the appeal. The issues were determined to be better left for resolution by the Court of Queen’s Bench after hearing vive voce evidence at trial.","The applicant sought to appeal from a chambers judge's decision not to vacate a certificate of pending litigation registered on behalf of her estranged husband, who was deceased and his estate was represented by his executors. The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The applicant had not considered whether the order appealed from was interlocutory or final in nature and had proceeded on that basis alone, with her notice of appeal deemed to be 'draft notice' of appeal. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The proposed appeal does not raise a new or controversial or unusual issue of practice, nor does it raise a valid question of law based on the facts of this matter, it does not transcend the particular in its implications. 2)It is impossible to conclude the proposed appeal is of sufficient importance to the proceedings before the Court of Queen's Bench or to the field of practice or the state of the law, or the administration of justice generally, to warrant determination by a panel of this Court."
6_1990canlii4137.txt,"This was an application under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the two appellant university professors was invalid and denied the rights of the appellants as guaranteed under ss. 15(1) and (7) of the Charter, and an order for reinstatement and back pay. Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s. 15(1), 24(1) and 52(1)(b) of the Charter of Rights for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the rights of the applicant as guaranteed under the Charter and that the respondent be paid all compensation due to them as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest, and costs of the proceeding. Allowing the application, setting aside the control test and ordering the respondent to pay all of its compensation to the applicants, that the order infringed the applicant's rights and was inconsistent with his and the respondent's collective agreement, and that, in the area of private discrimination, an entirely new system of civil liability in competition with the dispute resolution mechanisms fostered by human rights legislation would result."
6_1994canlii3963.txt,"The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana, contrary to s. 4(2) and 6(2) of the Narcotic Control Act. RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road. They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants. At trial, the court held their right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure had been violated, and acquitted them. The Crown appealed the acquittal. Per Roscoe, J.A., Chipman, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that there was no s. 8 breach because the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the field where the marijuana crop was growing. The court reviewed case law regarding 'open fields', and 'uncultivated' lands, and adopted the reasoning in Oliver v. United States, 104 S.Ct.1735(1984) in reaching its conclusion. Per Pugsley, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that the respondents had a reasonable expectation of privacy in activities carried on by them on their private property. As there were no exigent circumstances, the search was not reasonable and the evidence should be excluded.","The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana contrary to s. 4(2) and (6) of the Narcotic Control Act. The voir dire was held to determine the admissibility of evidence obtained by the police as a result of the seizure of 100 marijuana plants. The trial judge found that the police had no reasonable grounds for their belief that the property searched contained narcotics, that the warrantless search was invalid, and that the respondent had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to their occupation and possession of the property. He also held that warrantless searches violate the respondent's s. 8 Charter rights. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that s. 6 of the Charter applies. In this case, the court adopted the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in Katz v. United States (1967), 389 U.S.C.R. 347 and found that, in eight of the thirteen cases, the evidence was excluded, the propriety right alone, was not determinative of the privacy interest, and the evidence could have been obtained without a Charter violation."
6_1996canlii6791.txt,"Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless. The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.","The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their two children. The father and his wife, both medical professionals, claimed that the mother of the boys, his ex-wife and child and family counsellor, had wrongfully accused them of physically and sexually abusing them. HELD: 1)The mother's justification plea was withdrawn.  2)The evidence showed that the statements were made with express malice, which can be proven by extrinsic or intrinsic evidence. 3)The Court dismissed the application. It held that the facts brought into conflict different fundamental societal interests: society's interest in the protection of children from abuse, society's Interest in preventing a trial in which 'no party wins all parties lose', and the common interest of the people who make such communications. 4)The co-defendants brought an action to vary the custodial arrangements. They claimed that, on their face, the allegations of sexual and physical abuse and alcoholism in the father's home were defamatory. 5)The accused was found to have been negligent in the preparation of the reports."
6_1999canlii12571.txt,"The constable sought a writ of prohibition to prevent the respondent hearing officer from proceeding with the hearing into his conduct pursuant to discipline charges brought against him by the Chief of Police on the grounds there were contraventions of the Act, the Municipal Police Discipline Regulations and the rules of natural justice and the duty of fairness which resulted in the hearing officer having exceeded or lost jurisdiction to proceed with the hearing. He sought a declaration that a member of the police service must be informed of any investigation of his conduct prior to the commencement of the investigation as required by s.54 of the Police Act.; the Act does not permit the amendment in Form A discipline notice since it is a statutory form. The relief sought regarding disclosure had been abandoned by the applicant. The applicant argued that the fundamental questions to be addressed revolved around issues of statutory interpretation that must be resolved on a standard of correctness and the alternative remedies were not adequate. The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member. HELD: The application was dismissed. There is an adequate alternative remedy which should be pursued. There were no 'special circumstances' upon which the court should exercise its discretion to determine the merits of the application.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of prohibition to prevent the respondent hearing officer, in his capacity as Hearing Officer under The Police Act, from proceeding with the hearing into the applicant's conduct pursuant to discipline charges brought against him by the respondent police chief. HELD: 1) The applicant was a member of the Regina Police Service. Pursuant to the Act the applicant was charged with discreditable conduct. He was served with the Notice of Formal Discipline Proceedings in Form under the Act on October 28, 1998. He received no notice of the investigation pursuant to s. 54(1) of the Act. The hearing officer held that the existence of an adequate alternative remedy was held to constitute a bar because judicial review is a discretionary remedy and if an adequate remedy was available, it ought to be accessed.  2) The respondent argued the Court should decline to hear judicial review applications of interim decisions in discipline hearings. The applicant argued the fundamental questions to be resolved on a standard of correctness and that there should be an exercise of the court's extraordinary jurisdiction at this stage to prevent further denial of natural justice. 3) The convenience of the alternative remedy, the nature and extent of the error, and the appellate body (i.e., its investigatory, decision-making and remedial capacities) did not believe the category of factors should be closed as it is for the courts in particular circumstances to isolate and balance the factors which are relevant. 4) There was insufficient evidence to determine the merits of this application. The alternative remedies were not adequate. 5) In light of the inherent unfairness in the process of the commission, an appeal was not an appropriate alternative remedy.  6) There were no special circumstances existing in the scope of the application."
6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT. The applicants, charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana, were scheduled for separate trials this fall before Judge and Jury. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the authorization: a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance and a search warrant authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. A search warrant to search the applicant's residence in April 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones; a section 487.01(4) 9 day video surveillance authorization permitting the interception of private communications at the residence of each accused on the basis they were derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful; and a stay of proceedings on all charges against both applicants. HELD: 1) Leave to cross-examine is granted when the trial judge is satisfied that cross-examination is necessary to enable the accused to make full answer and defence. As information obtained from the electronic surveillance was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant and the subsequent search warrant both of these warrants should also be set aside. It would appear that an absolute waste of time and money to require duplication of such evidence on the Charter hearing. 2) The applicant sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrants and excluded from trial and addressed the recognized difficulty of normal police investigative activity ever identifying the source of supply, particularly with respect to offences of trafficking, conspiracy, or being an accessory after the fact."
6_2003skqb170.txt,"The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","The appellant was convicted of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a 1-year probation order. He appealed from the conviction. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1) The court found no error of law or miscarriage of justice as it did not accept the appellant's evidence that he used force only to protect the complainant from the natural hazards that existed in the location at night. The trial judge erred in law by making findings of fact based on evidence that did not exist; 2) The judge failed to apply the appropriate test for a prima facie case of assault.  3) The Court found that there were no photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries. That was an error of LAW. 4) The conviction could not be set aside for this reason.  5) It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal for the conviction or to substitute a conviction under s. 686. 6) Order to be made where a court of appeal allows an appeal under paragraph 6 (1)(a), it shall quash the conviction and have a direct judgment or verdict of acquittal to be entered; or (b) order new trial."

[3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'.

6_2004skpc25.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level. The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'. There was no symbol with it. In the blank that followed was written '5000C'. This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","The accused is charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The police observed the accused blowing into something that she described as an 'intoxilyzer' at the detachment. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s258(1)(g) for the intended purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol levels. It indicates that the samples were taken at 2:40 and 3:01. There is a total of alterations of preprinted material and one alteration of writing contained within one of the blanks. Of the five initialled changes, four are initialled. HELD: The accused's charge is dismissed. 1)It is not a requirement of subparagraph 258(2)(g)(i) to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection. The make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out either in the certificate or be proven by other evidence. 2)The accused's case law does not state that an approved instrument can be identified. The case law clearly states that the only way to do so is by way of a model. 3)There was insufficient evidence to establish that the accused blew into the object designated for the purpose of identifying her. There was no evidence of her impairment. 4)The certificate may be used to prove facts, not law. The instrument or type of instrument used is matter of fact; whether such an instrument is an approved is a matter of law. 5)The use of a certificate is shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be afforded, it must be employed. If Parliament had intended the contrary to be the case, it would have specifically stated that the authorized instrument needed to be identified, just as it did with respect to the alcohol standard. 6)There is insufficient evidence as to the model. The model does not adequately describe the instrument's function and application. 7)It would be inappropriate and inappropriate for the Court to comment upon the issues of the certificate and the certificate. 8)The charge was dismissed."
6_2005nsca65.txt,"Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information. The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences. Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","The Crown appealed the acquittals entered by the Provincial Court judge on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The Information alleged that police officers who were in attendance at a residence as a result of a fire were advised by firefighters of two sawed off shotguns in the home. The defence admitted that on May 30, 2003, the resident of the home where the firearms were found was subject to an order prohibiting possession of firearms and that he was not the holder of an firearms licence. At trial, defence counsel brought a motion for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence of one of the elements of the offence, that is, the date of that offence, which was not an essential element. The trial judge granted the motion because the Crown had failed to prove that the date as alleged in the Information. That was an error of law. The reasons for granting the motion were so inadequate that they did not meet the test for sufficiency of reasons because they do not provide any indication of why there was insufficient evidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The acquittalals were set aside and a new trial ordered.  1)There was no suggestion that the amendment of the date would mislead or cause prejudice or injustice to the accused. 2)The trial judge erred in law in that he did not provide sufficient reasons for the decision to grant the motion. The Crown's argument that the notice of absence was not sufficient to prove the date was not a essential element was rejected. 3)The Court noted that s.529(4.1), the predecessor of s.601(4) was similar to the common law rule that the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed, if it was proved the indictment was preferred within the prescribed time of limitation, that was also a reversible error.  4)The appeal is allowed with reasons to follow. 1)Sole and Miscellaneous Indications The Crown had not proven all of the alleged offences. The date of possession by the defence of the weapons was not essential to the offence. The evidence presented by the Crown was insufficient to meet the required test, whether there was any evidence upon which a reasonable jury, properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty."

The court allowed the relocation in part because the respondent would no longer be an access parent."
6_2007nssc119.txt,"Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies. Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect. Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation. Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency. Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately. The mother continued to require professional intervention.","The parties were involved in a rocky common law relationship between 1985 and 1995. They lived in Alberta and then Nova Scotia. At the conclusion of the relationship, L.M. became the custodial parent while the parents sought to have the custody order from Nova Scotia dismissed. The Agency consented to its continued involvement with the two children and sought the termination of its involvement with them both. The mother, who had recently moved from Alberta to Nova Scotia, alleged that the children had been involved in domestic violence, sexual abuse, and extreme poverty. The father, who now lived with his common-law partner, expressed concern that his children would not be able to live with him because of the protection history they had received from the Agency. When the mother and father separated, the Agency sought to terminate the children's relationship with the partner and sought an order dismissing the Nova Scotia proceedings. The partner's sister, who lived with the parents, also expressed concern about the children being placed with the father's common law partner (C.B.). The Agency refused to disclose relevant information to the court and the court until after the disposition review commenced. The children's representative confirmed that the Agency had forwarded a copy of the June 2005 risk conference minutes to the Agency and that the agency had forwarded it to the CAFS. The CAFS representative also confirmed that a copy had been faxed to CAFS and the agency was aware of the partner's past child protection history. CAFS requested that the files be re-examined as there was insufficient evidence to support the allegations of abuse by the partner. The CNFS representative was unable to identify when the agency first received the information about the partner’s history, given that it had been in Nova Scotia for more than a year and had not been made available to the Court until August 2006. The C.B. files were not to be viewed at the risk conference in February 2006 as the Agency did not have another placement for the children and, in addition, had not made any informed consent or informed the court as to their placement with the mother. The files contained historical references only and related, not to the partner, but rather to his common law practice. HELD: The court found that the information concerning the partner was simply not germane to the decision made by the Agency as the documents contained information that the parties had not disclosed to each other. The court ordered an ex parte order pursuant to the provisions of the Maintenance and Custody Act which prevented the partner from leaving Cape Breton until further"

6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","This is an appeal by the Crown from an order of a Provincial Court Judge declaring that the respondent is unfit to stand trial. The Crown applies that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, misstated the evidence, apply the wrong legal test for fitness, applied the wrong burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The limited cognitive capacity test (limited cognitive capacity) test strikes an effective balance between the objectives of the fitness rules and the constitutional right of the accused to choose his own defence and to have a trial within a reasonable time. 2) The respondent is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse/dependence disorder. He has been diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and is unable to distinguish reality from fantasy. He began residing in the foster home of a friend who has provided significant support and support for him. As he has grown up, the respondent has consistently run away from the protected environments sought for him and has begun to abuse alcohol and drugs. He is currently under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. His blood alcohol level is 110 mgs. per cent. He remained in custody until the fitness hearing on November 1, 2007.  3) In asking the court to require that the accused be able to act in his own best interests, this court asks that this court adopt the higher threshold 'analytic capacity' test for determining the accused's fitness. This test is not intended to displace the presumption of innocence to which he remains entitled. The real question to be determined in this case is whether the learned trial judge erred in holding that although the appellant can communicate with his lawyer, his ability to instruct counsel and to exercise analytical reasoning is not prerequisite that he be capable of exercising analytical reasoning in making choice to accept the advice of counsel or in coming to a decision that best serves his interests. 4) There are strong interests, both public and personal, in an accused being fit to proceed to trial. Many accused persons who are found not guilty by reason of a mental disability are exempted from criminal liability and punishment. The Court concludes that the policy of the law that such persons are sick as opposed to blameworthy and should be treated rather than punished. The threshold for fitness to stand...is lower than that for criminal responsibility. 5) The trial judge adopted the interpretation of the R. v. Gorecki test in relation to whether the accused is capable of following the proceedings generally, followed by"

M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code. After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions. HELD: The accused is sentenced to 9 months incarceration. Pursuant to s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code, a firearm order was made for 10 years prohibiting the accused from possessing any type of weapon. The accused shall also supply a sample of his DNA for analysis. There is an order under s. 490.012(1) that the accused comply with the Sexual Offender Information Registration Act. The accused is also prohibited, pursuant to an order under s. 161(1)(a), from attending a public park or swimming area where persons under the age of 14 years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, day care centre, school ground, playground or community centre for a period of 3 years.","The 37 year old accused pleaded guilty to a charge of sexually touching a person under the age of 14 years, contrary to s. 151(1) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute. In addition to the s. 490.012 of the Code, the Crown applies for s. 487.051 of the Criminal Code prohibiting S.C. from engaging in certain employment involving positions of trust or authority towards persons under the 18 years and prohibiting him from attending certain places as provided for by s. 161 of the code. This offence occurred in a particular circumstances and there is no indication that the acts of abuse were random nor is there any evidence that compulsive behaviours were involved. HELD: A sentence of nine months to serve in a Correctional institute will be imposed.  1) This is not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The maximum sentence in case such as this is 10 years plus a probation order. 2) The accused did not have any significant or related criminal record. He appeared to be well settled in a new relationship. The court observed that the physical and sexual abuse that he suffered at the hands of his family members have haunted and affected him throughout his life. 3) There can be no question by virtue of the recent amendments to the Code that the Parliament of Canada has clearly sought to protect the children and young people of this country from the abuse of adults. The Crown has done so in part by enacting the provisions of s. 718.01 mandating a mandatory prohibition order. 4) A further order shall issue pursuant to s742.1(ii) of S. 742.2(iii) that the offender comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, S.

6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff purchased a home in 1998. She engaged the services of the defendant Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After a search of the property, she found a house that she believed was suitable for her needs. She also sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. The plaintiff sues the defendants claiming aggravated damages against both defendants and punitive damages against them for failing to inform her that the home had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site. HELD: 1) The home did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. It was beyond her expectations that it be moved. She suffered irreparable damage to her home, both in the physical and mental condition of the home and in the manner in which it was constructed. The realtor and her husband were liable to her in damages both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the defendants. There was no discussion about home inspection.  2) The defendant's realtor was a friend of the plaintiff. She had seen the house before and was familiar with its construction. She was also familiar with the parlous system in the home which allowed her to observe the construction of the house from a distance. She did not know that this system was not in place in the rural municipality when the realtor first visited the plaintiff and she became convinced that it was a suitable home. She began to look at the home in the fall of 1998. It had heated by wood, had a gas line and was very close to the intersection with the highway. The parlor was too close to where the highway would come to the property. She heard the defendants discussing the possibility of widening the highway to allow the new construction to take place. She became concerned that the roof would not be able to function properly on the new home. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext. The original judgment has been corrected."

The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","One of the defendants in the main proceeding moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it pursuant to Rule 44.10(b) of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The plaintiff alleged the defendant had interfered with the plaintiff's timber harvesting contract by threatening violence, making gestures and other threats and interfering with the workers conducting the harvest operation. The plaintiff argued the attachment order should be terminated because it was not required to secure the party who obtained it, the existence of one or more grounds of attachment as set out in Rule 49.01(1), and that the mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants was not sufficient reason to dispose of the corporate veil. HELD: The attachment order was terminated. 1)The plaintiff failed to establish any of the grounds available under the rules governing attachment orders. 2)The affidavit did not properly incorporate the contents of the statement of claim. 3)The mere allegation could not be taken to mean that the plaintiff had not established the necessary intent. 4)Costs to the applicant were awarded in any event in the cause."

The party seeking production must establish relevance. Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location.

In August of 2013, the petitioner sought to amend her petition to include a claim for spousal support based on the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. In January of 2014, the petitioner filed an application for interim spousal support retroactive to the date of separation. HELD: The petitioner was awarded spousal support, but the award was not retroactive to the date of separation. The petitioner was entitled to spousal support from the date that she put the respondent on notice of her application for spousal support. The respondent, at age 61, should not be forced to work overtime in order to meet his spousal support obligations.

Two health care institutions, one residential lodge and one hospital, each of whose employees were represented by a different union, were to be integrated into one new institution, this Centre. The applications to the Board and the chamber judge both focused on facts they found to be significant. The Chamber judge took a less rigorous and legalistic view of successor in s. 37 than that ultimately taken by the Board. Allowing the appeal, that the Chamber judge failed to answer whether the Board's interpretation of successor was patently unreasonable. To jump immediately to an analysis in the facts premised on a different interpretation does not serve. The same analysis does not apply to other areas of the law, such as financing, conveyance of property or insurance where a more precise and predictable delineation of the moment of transfer may be appropriate. The Board is interpreting s.37 for the purposes of labour law alone. This is its function. To emphasize facts of lesser traditional legal significance in the board's judgment and those of more concrete significance in parallel areas for example, property law, begs the real question.

7_2010nsca95.txt,"The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff. The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the plaintiff. At issue was whether the Chambers judge erred in determining that the action against Chrysler had no reasonable chance of success and whether the lease agreement had none of the characteristics of a rental agreement as contemplated by s. 62 of the Motor Vehicle Act. The reverse onus provision did not apply. The appellants had filed an affidavit of claim against the respondent in relation to the use of the vehicle and an application was brought against it by the insurer. The Chambers judge cited Bazley (¶ 45-48) as an example of how to apply the law and found that the issue was unambiguously determined by the precedents. The only potential application of s. 248 in this case was that of a leasing company. The lease agreement clearly falls into the 'lease with right of purchase' exception to the definition of 'owner.' The appeal turned on the interpretation of two provisions of the Act which dealt with the issue of whether the appellants established that their claim for vicarious liability against the automobile corporation fell into the same category as those of the automobile dealer. The insurer was not a party to the motion or on this appeal."
7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","The accused, a young person, was arrested after police stopped a car suspected of being involved in a robbery with a firearm at a specific address in Sackville. The car was stopped minutes after the robbery with the person who had pleaded guilty to the robbery and a gun and number of items reported to have been stolen in the robbery. The gun was found under the back seat of the car loaded. The accused was not asked to implicate the accused directly but said that he had been picked up at some building somewhere in Fairview. HELD: The court found that the circumstantial evidence did not support the inference that the accused was either mistaken or not telling the whole truth. The evidence of the accused’s involvement would have to be so strong that it would allow the inference to be made that he was one of the people involved in that robbery. It would also be reasonable to conclude that the person in the car who was picked up in the parking lot was the one who picked up the accused and the gun and the brass knuckles."
7_2011skpc143.txt,"The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals. The issue was whether the claims should be issued. HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","The court refused to issue a summons to the defendant in relation to a number of claims. The defendant had submitted 18 claims for issuing to the court on behalf of the claimants. In the interim, the defendant responded to an Interim Ruling issued by the judge. The judge did not provide a clear understanding of what had been ruled on in the interim Ruling nor did he provide an adequate accounting for his entire loss if proven. At issue was whether or not the defendant should be issued a summons pursuant to s. 7(4) of The Small Claims Act. HELD: The defendant was not entitled to a summons. The summons was refused and the matter was set aside. The court ordered that the defendant return the claims for service within two weeks. There was no privity of contract between the claimants and the federal government. The applicant should be given an opportunity to argue the issues identified."

The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it. Since the parties had given notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case, the Court ordered that the deponents be produced for the purpose of cross-examination.","FIAT: The plaintiffs commenced their statement of claim under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Saskatchewan on April 27, 2009.

In February 2012, counsel for the plaintiffs and Orion Morgan, president of the defendant corporation, asked for an adjournment of the simplified trial which was granted on May 2, 2012. Orion Morgan advised the plaintiffs that his corporation had recently been dissolved and advised them that the plaintiffs should be allowed to pursue an appeal. The Court made an interim order subject to further argument by the plaintiffs on September 5, 2012, that the Court accept the plaintiff's affidavit and that the plaintiff should make herself available for the purpose of cross-examination.

7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The court upheld the sentence of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge for the offence of unlawfully trafficking in forest products. The Crown appealed the sentence imposed on the defendant on a charge of unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The defendant was found not guilty on all of the counts. The court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the wood sold to the undercover officer was wood coming from Crown lands. Therefore, the conviction should be quashed. The Court of Queen's Bench stated that it was not satisfied that during the period the defendant harvested wood from Crown land and sold it to an undercover officer, that he should not have taken this as an admission, as it was inconsistent with the evidence established."
7_2015skqb352.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – Best Interests of ChildFamily Law – Custody and Access – Interim – VariationFamily Law – DivorceFamily Law – Evidence – AffidavitThe parties were in a high-conflict situation and brought five interim applications with various requests. They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","HELD: The Court granted the application. It ordered the child to be registered in the Montessori program and begin attending as soon as the program was able to accommodate such attendance. The cost of that program was to be paid at the trial stage by the petitioner. In the interim, the parties had discussed the issue of increasing parenting time and whether this should proceed to a pre-trial conference, even an expedited pre- trial conference. There was no reason for the denial of the divorce at this stage. The child had been spending time with the mother and was doing well in the program. The issues of custody and access had not been resolved until now. The mother was seeking to have additional time with her new child and the father wanted to have that time spent with him. The father had already paid for an assessment and the consultant had advised him he should have that material soon. An interim order can be varied if there is evidence of risk to the children or if there are compelling reasons to change it. However, it appears this matter was resolved prior to the matter coming to chambers. The fact it continued to be argued in chambers is perhaps more reflection of the lack of communication between the parties than any real issue surrounding the child's care and access."

HELD: The application was granted. The court reviewed the pleadings drafted by the self-represented plaintiff and found his claims had no reasonable prospect of success and struck them.,"HELD: SaskTel brought an application seeking an order striking the defendant's Statement of Claim under Rule 7-9(1)(a) of the Queen's Bench Rules on the basis that it discloses no reasonable claim and for an order for costs. SaskTel was awarded its costs. 1) The power to strike out claims that have no reasonable prospect of success is valuable housekeeping measure essential to effective and fair litigation. It unclutters the proceedings, weeding out the hopeless claims and ensuring that those that have some chance of success go on to trial. 2) On an application to strike, the facts set forth in the Statement of claim are considered to be true unless manifestly incapable of proof. It is incumbent on the plaintiff to clearly plead the facts upon which he relies in making his claim. Having reviewed the pleadings carefully, I conclude that Mr. Schutte's claims against SaskTel have no, reasonable and probable cause of success. Sasktel is awarded the costs."
7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in these proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life is in possession of the funds. It claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the insurer whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be made. HELD: 1) While interpleader relief is appropriate, the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction is not immediately apparent. At this stage the competing claims to surplus are on the one hand Ag Credit and on the other hand Empire Life. The argument that Ag Credit collected monies from its clients for the purposes of paying their insurance premiums, had a fiduciary duty to do precisely that; the fact that the Superintendents' Guidelines governing group insurance provided that no other person had a competing interest to the Ag Credit's right and title was unnecessary. Since no one was entitled to any portion of the surplus, it was deemed within the meaning of the Act that all monies received by Ag Credit were property of the Crown and should be paid directly to it. 2) While there was an arguable case that the claimed surplus belongs to the clients under the policy, Empire Life has acted in full compliance with its duty of uberrima fides in bringing the potentially valid claims of the insured clients to the attention of the Court and in resisting the claimant's claim to pay the premiums that resulted in the surplus. It is also arguable that given the circumstances, the right of appeal to the Court may not be reached at this stage. 3) The parties may conclude that the funds actually remain in the hands of Empire Life, with the potential of continuing to earn interest, rather than be placed on deposit with the Court while this matter proceeds forward to final decision. If they are not able to agree, either party may bring the matter back before the Court for decision."

The vessel was based in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia but was in Halifax at the end of the Marblehead race.

Dismissing the appeal, that s. 2(4) is a supplementary provision to guard against the methods of avoidance of the purchase tax.

If the legislators wished to have the actions of the respondent considered an offence an appropriate amendment to subsection would be necessary."

The court was satisfied there were degenerative changes in the plaintiffs spine which were accelerated by the accident. The pain problems were caused or contributed to by the defendant's negligence. An award for lost wages was also reduced by a factor of 33.%.","This was an action for damages for injuries suffered by the plaintiff as a result of a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff was stopped on the Cole Harbour Road by a flagman to allow a piece of heavy machinery to back out onto the road. Her motor vehicle was struck from behind by the vehicle operated by the defendant. The damage to the plaintiff's vehicle consisted of a bent bumper which had to be replaced at a cost of $528.61. The injuries were aggravated by the motor vehicle crash. The defendant admitted liability and was liable for 33.33 percent of this sum. The court awarded $70,305.12 plus pre-judgment interest and added $5,875 for lower back injury and $25,000 for whiplash injury. For the first injury, the plaintiff was diagnosed as having a pre-existing condition. At the time of the accident, she was undergoing degenerative changes in her spine which caused her to miss work for a period of 4 years. She had continued working as a CNA for nine years prior to the accident. At that time, she had continued to suffer from chronic lung disease, which required treatments of such a as to prevent her from returning to work until age 65 or even early retirement at age 58. She began suffering from osteoarthritis in the neck and had to undergo treatment for three to six months. She underwent surgery to repair the damaged back and was able to work part-time for four years."
8_1995canlii5717.txt,"The Respondent and the Applicant had a violent argument after which the Applicant and the child left the matrimonial home and moved to Transition House. The Applicant sought and obtained an emergency intervention order under The Victims of Domestic Violence Act from a Justice of the Peace giving her exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home and restraining her husband from having any contact with her or their daughter during the currency of the order. This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review. The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section. The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered. HELD: Order vacated.  1)An emergency intervention order is granted by a Justice of the Peace under s.3 of the Act without notice to the person whose conduct it restrains and without any representations from that person or on that person's behalf. It is an extraordinary remedy to be granted only where serious and urgent circumstances indicate a need for prompt action to protect the victim. 2)Absent such urgency, the application should be one for a 'victim's assistance order' brought to a Queen's Bench Judge in Chambers under s.7 in accordance with The Queen's Bench Rules. 3)In this case the domestic violence complained of occurred on January 28. There was no evidence that on February 1, 1995, Dolgopol was at risk of immediate harm. There was by then no element of urgency and the application for relief should have awaited the regular Queen's Bench Family Law Division chamber sittings.  4)The Court commented that it was unclear whether this rehearing was to proceed de novo or as a review but determined that the order should not stand in any event and therefore terminated it forthwith.","FIAT.

The respondent contested that the petition for divorce was a nullity and Saskatchewan courts did not have jurisdiction to hear the divorce proceedings and lacked jurisdiction or ought to decline to exercise jurisdiction under the Children's Law Act. Both parties made serious allegations against the other and there was substantial conflict in the affidavit evidence. HELD: An order for interim custody was granted on the condition the petitioner continued to reside with his parents in Regina and that the child not be removed from Regina without further court order. 1)The respondent did not acquiesce to the child's residing in Saskatchewan such that it may be said he was habitually resident here for the purposes of the Children's Law Act.  2)The seven factors listed in s15(1)(b) are conjunctive and the petitioner must satisfy them all. With respect to (iii) a petition for divorce was commenced in July 1996. 3)The child had a real and substantial connection with Saskatchewan and it was appropriate to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to s15(1)(b). Jurisdiction existed pursuant to s15(3) as the child had a closer connection to Saskatchewan then to Alberta. Both sets of grandparents and other family members on both sides reside in Saskatchewan. The child had no connection of consequence to the Province of Alberta.,FIAT. The petitioner sought interim custody of his only child born in 1996. Section of the Divorce Act requires either spouse to be ordinarily resident in the province for at least 1 year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding.

HELD: There was sufficient reliable evidence to constitute the reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant. The evidence was compelling and the officer did not substitute his or her view for that of the authorizing judge. There were at least three concerns to be addressed in weighing evidence relied on by the police to justify a warrantless search: was the information predicting the commission of a criminal offence compelling? Where that information was based on a tip originating from outside the police, was that tip credible? Finally, was the evidence corroborated by police investigation prior to making the decision to conduct the search? There were strengths and weaknesses in the evidence, but overall it was compelling."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The plain and ordinary meaning of the words of s. 14(2) of the Act is that only the court appealed from has power to extend the time within which leave must be sought. Section 14(2) of the Act prevails over s. 9(6) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000.","The Prospective Appellant sought an order extending the time to apply for leave to appeal and for leave/adrenaline in a proposed appeal. The Bank had taken no steps to appeal within the twenty-one day period due to an inadvertence of its lawyer.

They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause. It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement. However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole. Accordingly, the voting agreement is not caught by subsection 14.01.","All parties agreed that the case turned on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement, which provides that: If a party wishes to sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its Participating Interest, the parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or disposing of any interest other than all of its participating Interest to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the Joint venture agreement; and if a party wished to buy an Offered Interest for cash, subject to rights of the Purchasers pursuant to Article XIV of the Offering Notice, it shall give written notice to the purchaser of the interest that is offered for sale and shall also state the cash consideration and other terms on which the sale and purchase is desired to be made by the Vendor to the Third Party."
8_2009nssc351.txt,"The action, originally filed in 2000, concerned allegations of breach of - fiduciary duty, trust, industry regulations/standards, contract; and claims of negligence and malpractice. These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant. The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years. The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay. After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here. On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice. There is a significant documentary record of the transactions. The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner. The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time. While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice. Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","The plaintiffs filed an Originating Notice and Statement of Claim in 2000. They claimed that the defendant RBC caused them to suffer losses on investments. Two of the plaintiffs were associated in the practice of law and one of them was a solicitor of record. RBC counterclaimed for contribution and indemnity from RBC, alleging that RBC covered the stock issues of the two companies and provided information about available gold was misleading. The defendant denied any wrongdoing, and argued that the delay was entirely due to the negligence of the plaintiff's solicitor and, therefore, was inordine. Application to dismiss the proceeding dismissed; the delay is not inordinate; the actions of RBC must be examined on the facts of the case; the court must take into account the position of the defendant solicitor and strike a balance between the interests of the parties. Although RBC may have received some assistance in the early stages of the proceeding, it did not act in a fashion that would accord it credit for the delay; RBC acquiesced to a slow tempo of litigation; and there were 11 years between the time the alleged activities occurred and the date of the application. The delay was caused by the delay caused by RBC's failure to file its List of Documents, a failure by the plaintiffs to obtain sufficient information, and RBC’s acquiescence to the slow pace of litigation."

The respondent failed to show that, on balance, an action is the preferable route. While not all of the witnesses will be ascertained quickly, the important ones can be, which is all that Rule 6.03(5)(a) requires. The hearing should be predictable in scope and length and ready to be heard within months. The issues are straightforward. The only thing that would cause delay is the intended counterclaim.","Applicants, Peter Boone and Loren Bough, hold some $2.5 million in debentures issued by the Respondent, Medusa Medical Technologies Inc. The debentureures have matured and Medusa has failed to pay the principal and interest amounts owing. The Respondent takes steps to secure payment of their debenteures by means of an application to this Court. The applicant applies to have the Bough application converted into an action. The intent being that once that occurs, the separate action for damages commenced by Medusa will be consolidated into one action with Boone and Bough as plaintiffs and Medus as defendant and plaintiff by counterclaim. In the alternative, the moving party, the defendant corporation, will consider whether to pursue a motion to convert as it fails to meet its burden of proving such a proposition on a balance of probabilities. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1) Rule 6.03(4) provides a number of factors in favour of the application including the ability to quickly ascertain who their important witnesses will be and whether the application is appropriate for an allegation of 'oppression'. 2) The application can be heard in months rather than years. The issue that will necessarily drag the proceedings to years is the intended counterclaim for as yet undeterminable, possible or potential economic losses allegedly caused by the respondent's enforcement application. 3) The statements of facts filed by the parties in their affidavits at the hearing confirm the statements made by them in the initial application. 4) The Court was satisfied the plaintiffs could be found to be ready and able to proceed in any meaningful way for year and would presume substantially longer than that."
8_2015skqb144.txt,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The petitioner was granted joint custody with the mother with primary residence with the father and access for the mother. The father was ordered to pay maintenance for himself under the Family Maintenance Act. The mother was granted interim shared custody. The parties had not spoken since November 28, 2012 when the father filed an Answer and Counter-Petition. He had previously filed an answer and counter-petition in January 2013 contesting the mother's claims for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, the request for restraining order and costs. The petitioner argued that the parties had followed the interim agreement which provided that the father would have sole custody and supervised access of the mother and the father for a period of time. She alleged that this did not provide sufficient protection for the child as he was in constant pain and would not be able to get out of bed at night. HELD: 1) The evidence from the mother who had custody of the child at the time of the original application was that her son had been kept from her for two weeks. She telephoned the father the next morning principally to try and get the child out of the father’s house. 2) There was nothing wrong with the state of mind of the petitioner. The child had a normal life, lived with his mother every afternoon and sometimes went to sleep with her. 3) The father had access to the computer and the Internet. 4) The parties’ communication was limited by the fact that the child had not seen his mother for two months. 5) The parents were unable to contact each other for several days because of the restrictions placed upon them by the father. 6) The child was not able to participate in activities with his father. The parents’ inability to contact him during the day resulted in a lack of communication with each other. There was a high level of hostility between the parties that resulted in the imposition of conditions upon the father such that his access was limited to one day per week for six months. There were a number of incidents that led the father to believe that he was abandoning the child and that the mother needed to end the relationship."
8_2017skqb249.txt,"HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel had constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The parties entered into three separate contracts in 2008 that each provided that any disputes which could not be resolved by the parties would be settled by binding arbitration. The contracts each provided an implied condition that the parties could appeal an arbitrators' decision based on, among other things, the finality of the arbitrators’ decision and the very limited nature of potential appeals. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The language of the agreements was so clear with respect to the arbitration clauses and their finality that they cannot be overridden by vagueness or inadvertent omission. 2)Leave to appeal on a questions of law simply does not fall into the category of the obvious or something that 'it goes without saying' in the factual matrix of this case. Such an implied term is not akin, for instance, to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation or the term of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment. Rather, it is simply an expression of intention. 3)The parties referred to one, and only one, specific instance in which an appeal would be permitted. There is simply no other reasonable interpretation of the words 'arbitration agreement' and the absence of reference to any other circumstances in which such an appeal could be permitted was intentional. 4)The arbitration panel did not impose an obligation on the applicant to purchase a set number of licences from HAL. The only order that the applicant must make was the minimum of $10,000 per month. The governing law is to be the Province of Saskatchewan. 5)Each party may make one set of each type of discovery request and one dispositive motion. 6)The absence of any reference to other relevant circumstances in the arbitration panel's decision was not inadvertent, but intentional. The degree of generality (precedential value) of the agreement, and the order in which the parties referred (in part) to one of the clauses in the contracts, together with the wording of the governing law applicable to each party (the IDSL, the SCA and the ESMA) meant that any appeal would not be subject to appeal except on that very narrow issue. 7)It is clear that these contracts are not intended to be a means for the parties to avoid protracted litigation. The more narrow the rule, the less useful it is to limit the intervention of appellate courts to cases where the results"

The court found that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right because it was in excess of the amount due. The judgment was also set aside on the merits. It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action. As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act.

On appeal it was held to be entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total amount of $420,000.

Awarding 5 months interest, that the date from which interest is calculated in this type of action is upon completion of the appeal process. An appropriate interest claim under s. 41(I) therefore only exists for the five month period between the Court of Appeal's assessment determination and the refund of the property tax five months later.","The plaintiff municipal tax payer paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total of $420,177.13.  The plaintiff sought interest pursuant to s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra on the refund from the date it made the overpayments in response to HRM's tax invoices requiring payment of those amounts on the due dates. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld the Utility and Review Board's assessment determination which translated into $420 million overpayment of taxes. HRM paid the refund of overpaid real property taxes to Canada Trust in the City of Dartmouth, now Halifax Regional Municipality (""HRM""). HRM earned interest on this money from the time of receipt or had the use of these monies. The plaintiff appealed the reduced assessment and was awarded a partial refund of the overpaid taxes. At the end of the assessment, the assessment was reduced and this had the ramification of an overpayment when the taxes were recalculated. Canada Trust applied for the return of any amount overpaid as soon as the appeal provisions of the Assessment Act had been exhausted. The court found an obligation to refund excess taxes in 1994 but awarded a prejudgment interest order back to 1988, being the date when the overpayment was first remitted. An interest rate of 8.75% being a rate equatable to the interest rate charged by HRM on overdue taxes (prime plus 4.75) is an appropriate rate on the principal amount for the five month period between the assessment determination in March 1997 and the payment of the property tax refund in September 1997 as well as on the unpaid interest until the date of judgment. In all three years, the plaintiff paid its taxes in three of the 3 years and was held eligible for a refund on the balance of the payments in the three year period from March 1997 to September 1997. The appeal court upheld the assessment decision upholding the reduction in the assessment. In the interim, the utility and review board issued a partial tax refund (tax refund cheque). In the final three years of the appeal, the assessed value of the municipality's property taxes was reduced by approximately $400,000.

In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision. The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case. The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.  4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided.","The appellant appealed a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board which held that the use of the MAF to be used in calculating the assessed value of a shopping centre was in breach of s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1) Market Mall was built in 1966 and underwent expansions in 1979, 1982, 1987 and 1992. As with all other fully enclosed shopping centres in Saskatoon, the assessor calculated MAF of 0.94 for the mall. If it had been grouped with other commercial retail buildings in its commercial building neighbourhood, its MAF would have been 0.65. 2) In this case, the appellant only raised two issues: 1) Did the assessment Appeals Committee erred in law by concluding that functional obsolescence does not apply to an add-on type of construction or by finding that there must be an inability of an improvement to perform the function for which it is used? Or, to put it another way, it was decided on the evidence or lack thereof. 3) The appeal was arrived at not as a result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but as a consequence of the failure to establish to the satisfaction of the committee the facts on which it based its case.  4) The decision is beyond our jurisdiction. The appeal must be allowed on the same basis in respect of these grounds of appeal."

The complainant willingly took part in a fight club after which the accused followed him and engaged in a second physical altercation with him. During the fight, the parties fell into a dresser, onto the floor and out a window. At some stage of the fight, the complainant sustained a nasal fracture, which was the basis of the charge. Accused not guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The confrontation between the accused and the complainant was one continuing episodic event and the complainant's actions were provoked by the accused. However, no causal relationship was shown between the blows of the accused and the broken nose sustained by the complainant. There were too many variables and probabilities as to how the complainant's nose might have become broken.","Six persons shared an upstairs apartment. The complainant was the boyfriend of another tenant. The parties had been drinking in the basement and had stumbled into a fight in the living room. The accused, who had invited the complainant to join them for a fight, advanced and struck the complainant in the face. HELD: The accused was convicted of assault causing bodily harm. The Court found that the accused could not rely on the Criminal Code s.34(1) for his defence as he did not have the means to do so. He must not have intended to cause grievous bodily harm and the evidence did not lend an air of reality to the submitted factual underpinnings."

The s. 7 expenses claimed by the petitioner include dental work of $112.90 for Kristen, orthodontic work for Brina and costs associated with Brina's post-secondary education. It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities that necessitate certain tools such as a computer for her to be successful in her post-secondary training. HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses and there shall be an order accordingly. 2) The September 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina's s. 7 expenses. Accordingly the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s. 7 costs. 2) The crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on Brina's part and will assist her with her future plans. 3) The Zeller's supplies would normally be covered under the Table support and that expense is disallowed. 4) Brina's s. 7 post-secondary expenses are $7,123.72 and include tuition, crisis prevention class and books, required university books, bus pass, black cartridge for the printer, Shaw internet, Microsoft licence, computer repairs and updated virus protection.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to have arrears fixed with regard to s. expenses related to her daughter's post-secondary education and in addition requests that the amount to be fixed for the ongoing s. 7 expenses be specified. HELD: 1) The respondent is to immediately pay his 66% share of the dental and orthodontic expenses which are covered by his health plan within 30 days. In the case of the plaintiff claiming for 2003/2004 s. 8 expenses, he is to pay 66% of their s.7 costs.  2) The petitioner also requests that insurance proceeds be paid to the petitioner. 3) In September 2005, the respondent terminated his obligation to pay support for his oldest child, Corry and ordered in addition to ongoing support for the two youngest children, payment of s. o expenses and the computer repairs and equipment were included in the respondent's s7 expenses. The crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred by the petitioner's part and will assist her in her future plans. The Zellers supplies were disallowed. 4) In October 2005, Justice R. S. Smith terminated Mr. Alm's obligation for child support purposes, by paying $391.80 per month for 1 year and continuing on the 1st day of each and every month thereafter until further order of the Court. 5) The sole issue before the Court is the amount of the ongoing S.7 expenses, which are the ongoing expenses.  6) It is for that purpose that the matter now comes before me. The respondent provided evidence of student loans or student loans repayment by third parties to the expenses. 7) It was noted that the September 2005 consent order provided that computer repairs were included as part of the respondent’s s.8 expenses. Accordingly, the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s.’7 costs and the crisis prevention classes were included.” 8) The Court found that the respondent had not paid any of the s.O. expenses for the 2005/2006 year. It was also found that in light of the above, the 2008 consent order, computer repairs would not be covered by the health plan."
9_2007skqb98.txt,"The appellants were found guilty of breaching a rural municipal bylaw which provides 'That no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned Hamlet [sic].' There were four grounds of appeal: 1) an application to admit new evidence on appeal; 2) a constitutional challenge seeking a declaration that the bylaw was ultra vires for uncertainty; 3) the significance of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw; and 4) the meaning of the word 'livestock' in the bylaw. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) New evidence will not be admitted on an appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial. Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. Neither of these requirements is met. 2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned. In any event, the uncertainty on which the appellants rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist. 3) The appellants misunderstand the use of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw. 4) Whatever definition of 'livestock' is used, the definition always includes cattle.","At a June 2, 2006 trial in Provincial Court, the appellants were found guilty of breaching a bylaw of the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No.345. The trial justice convicted them of breaching Bylaw 2-1995, which provides that no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned hamlet. The appellants did not lead evidence at trial. They did not dispute that they were keeping cattle on their property. Their defence related to points of law. HELD: The application to admit new evidence was dismissed. 1)The appellants had not given notice under the Constitutional Questions Act. Notice is required when the constitutionality of bylaw is questioned. 2)The uncertainty suggested by appellants that they could have admitted new evidence based upon the evidence did not exist. The documents included correspondence and notes for presentation to a meeting of the council of the rural municipality. The proposed amendments relate to the basic planning statement, not to the zoning bylaw or to the bylaw under which they were convicted. Cattle are livestock, and so cattle are not permitted in the district. 3)In the absence of a specific definition of livestock, the word is uncertain. The word can be defined so broadly as to be either meaningless or unenforceable. 4)There was no basis on the trial decision given that the three bylaws tendered were only meant to refer to a particular subdivision of hamlet and did not bear upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue at the trial."
9_2008nssc18.txt,"The defendant council, charged with the general oversight and administration of matters under the Natural Products Marketing Act, delegated certain authority to commodity boards such as the plaintiff. The plaintiff requested that the defendant hold a show cause hearing to determine whether certain producers had contravened their licence but when a procedural breakdown occurred as to how that hearing would be conducted, with the plaintiff seeking and being denied an adjournment, the hearing was held without the plaintiff's participation. The plaintiff brought an application for mandamus to compel the defendant to hold a new hearing and filed two affidavits providing some detail and background information as to its reasoning for its failure to attend the hearing and the parties' differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. The defendant brought an application to strike certain of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff on the basis that they were an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not forming part of the record. Application to strike affidavits dismissed; the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible. There was no authority for denying the parties the use of affidavits should this application proceed as a jurisdictional dispute and, should it proceed by way of an error of law on the face of the record, the affidavits were also admissible to complete the record.","The applicant Board applied for an order pursuant to the Civil Procedure Rules 14.25(1) and 38.11 to strike the affidavits of Sonya Lorette and her colleagues as an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not in or forming part of the Record of the Council Panel. The Attorney General had previously dismissed the applicant Board's application. The applicant sought to have the affidavit evidence struck as being inconsistent with the Board's positions on several issues concerning the validity of the Merks brothers' licences and their respective roles in the application of the management plan. In addition, the applicant argued that the Court ought to restrict itself to considering the record as produced by the tribunal and not to allowing the application to proceed. Application dismissed; the affidavit evidence is admissible; the record is not an issue for the purposes of this application; if the matter is a jurisdictional dispute the application can be dismissed as a matter of fact rather than a new hearing."
9_2013skca85.txt,"The respondent mother applied to lift the stay of execution imposed by Court of Appeal Rule 15(1) when the appellant father appealed the trial judge's decision to award custody of the parties' son to the mother with the child to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the school year (see: 2013 SKQB 212). The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother. HELD: The Court granted the application. There would be no harm to the child if the stay was lifted. The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted.","The applicant mother sought a lifting of the stay of execution on the judgment of the trial judge (indexed as 2013 SKQB 212 (CanLII)) which was automatically imposed upon the father's appeal from that decision. HELD: The application was granted and the stay was lifted in accordance with the factors set out in s. 8(a)(i) of the Children's Law Act.  It was not possible to conclude that the child could be bonded or attached to either of his parents in any meaningful way. The child was essentially abandoned by both his parents from the time he was a toddler until he was 10 or 11 years old. The father's seeming inability to facilitate the child's access to his mother and his sister, especially where access has been ordered by the court, is of considerable concern. It is in the best interests of the child to lift the stay."

The Rentalsman granted a writ of possession and after the issuance of the writ, amended the writ to correct the address without notice to the tenant. The tenant appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. There had not been compliance with s. 23(1)(b) of the Act. The notice to vacate was therefore ineffective and the consequent writ of possession was quashed. Given the tenant's obstructionist tactics he was denied his costs of the appeal.","The tenant was served with notice to deliver up the premises described as 201 1st Street West in the Town of Blaine Lake.

An adjacent landowner refused to consent to the declaration. The applicant sought a declaration that the consent of the adjacent landowner was not required. Granting the application, that the word 'encumbrance' as defined in s.3(1)(o) of the Act involves a security feature and as there is no security feature to a right of way, unlike a mortgage or lien, it is not an encumbrance. The consent of the adjacent landowner, who had a right of way over a servient tenement, was not required.","The owner of a land subject to a right of way in favor of all landholders out of the original undivided piece of land refused to consent to the registration.

The Registrar of Condominiums advised the applicant that s. 11(b) of the Condominium Property Act prohibits him from registering a declaration with respect to the property unless the owners of right ofway consent consent to it. The Applicant applied to the Court for mandamus to grant a declaration, arguing that there was no such duty on the Registrar's Office and, therefore, mandamus was not available. The Court granted the declaration, noting that mandamus is not available and that, if the facts were with the applicant, there was a remedy for use where an individual wishes to establish the existence or scope of a public duty."

Here the applications were so closely related that where it was improper to act in one, it was improper to act in the other.","The defendant applied to strike the plaintiff's proceeding on the basis that the application was supported by a 17 page, 123 paragraph affidavit. The plaintiff placed himself in the position of a witness who may be cross-examined. Application to strike struck; plaintiff's application to have Lienaux removed as solicitor for the plaintiff struck dismissed. The application was based on an application by the defence, that he should not be allowed to continue in the proceeding because he is a witness and not a client agent. The defence took the position that the notice and affidavit were nothing more than document to the court the matters complained of by the plaintiff.

A Provincial Court Judge sentenced him to 5 months closed custody concurrent with a sentence of 9 months open custody which he was serving at the time of his escape. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused had a lengthy record as a young offender and turned 18 two days after the commission of the last of the offences for which he was being sentenced. 2)The Court substituted a sentence of 12 months closed custody, concurrent with the 9 months open custody which he was already serving.","A young offender escaped custody following his guilty plea to four Criminal Code offences.

b_1997canlii11375.txt,"The plaintiff, a specialty seed marketing company, claimed damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. Johnson Seeds entered contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting to secure product for resale. After extended negotiations the defendant eventually signed and mailed the standard form contract but never received an executed copy. The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993. The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price. HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action. 1)There was a valid contract between the parties. Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94. The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions. Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.  4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem. Johnson Seeds waited until the last possible day under the written contract terms to call the contract in an effort to position itself to claim increased damages for breach of contract.","The plaintiff Seeds claims damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. The plaintiff Seeds purchases specialty crops from producers and contracts with purchasers, including other traders or packagers, for the resale of these specialty crops. To secure the product for resale, the plaintiff entered into contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting of the same. The contract stipulated that the plaintiff receive a fully executed copy of the contract when it is delivered. The defendant attempts to have matching contracts for the quantum of specialty crops required with various producers with options for differing times of delivery to match the demand of the purchaser and to meet the delivery date requirements in the sales contracts. HELD: 1)A contract was entered. The delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract so that it could be legally binding and enforceable. 2)The plaintiff knew the contract had been signed. He had seen it in person, by telephone, by fax and by mail. 3)Although it may have been in the reasonable contemplation of the plaintiff that he would receive back a fully-executed copy, there was no doubt that in the telephone conversations he had with the defendant in November and December 1993, he verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. He also confirmed in one of the telephone calls that he had spoken to the plaintiff regarding the quality of the canary seed. 4)Although the plaintiff did not receive a copy of each contract executed by the defendant, it was possible to argue that the contract was not valid. The post office was legitimate agent of Johnson Seeds for the purpose of communicating the acceptance of the offer and confirming it. The telephone records did not show any of the conversations between the plaintiff and the defendant. 5)A letter was written on the back of each document confirming that the defendant had signed the contract and that it was for a binding and legally enforceable contract to be executed. 6)Each party was entitled to its own opinion on the contract."
b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the Court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial in the trial proper and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so, and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)It is in the interest of conducting an orderly trial that the trial judge is entitled to insist and should insist that defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial. All issues of notice to the Crown and sufficiency of disclosure can be sorted out at that time. 2)This can quite properly occur by the application of some or all of the evidence which is already before the court and on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of that evidence can be reserved by the Court, pending the determination of the Charter issue on its merits and the application for s.24 remedy, if any. 3)There is no justification for the procedure presently proposed in R. v. Kutynec. It must be recognized that there will be instances where the defence, through no fault of its own, cannot provide a detailed summary of what it anticipates it will call in the charter application. It may be that fairness requires that the accused be given some latitude at some stage of the proceeding to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to explore at the relevant time. In such circumstances, the court would be reluctant to foreclose an inquiry into an alleged violation. There will, however, be circumstances where no less severe order will prevent unfairness and maintain the integrity of the process."

After being involved in an accident, the accused was taken to hospital where a blood demand was given and eventually acceded to. The accused challenged the validity of the blood demand and argued that his right to counsel was violated. Accused guilty of operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit; there was no violation of the accused's right to counsel. The officer had valid grounds to make the demand, having been advised that the accused was in an accident, that someone had said the accused was either high or intoxicated, having smelled a mild odour of alcohol on the accused and the accused having advised him that he only had three beer. Even if the accused's claim to amnesia for all the events around that time was believed, there was no medical evidence to suggest that he could not understand what the officer said to him at the hospital. Although his degree of alertness may have fluctuated, he displayed an understanding of the situation by showing appropriate concern for how much he had been drinking and asking questions which showed an understanding of his situation and what speaking to counsel would entail.","The accused was charged under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code with operating a motor vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit. The accused was found to have had three beers with him at the time of the accident. He testified that he only had three at the scene when he heard the demand. He alleged that the officer had conflated advice from a doctor regarding possible endangerment to health with advice as to ability to comprehend and comply. HELD: 1) Upon detention, the accused had the right under ss. 10(a) and (b) to be informed promptly of the reasons therefor and to retain and instruct counsel. This is not to say that the accused's comprehension may not be a factor in assessing whether the police or other public authority has discharged its informational obligation. If there are indications that the person under detention has not sufficiently understood or appreciated his or her right to counsel when conveyed to him or her, the duty will entail such steps as are necessary to facilitate adequate comprehension. In the absence of signs of lack of such comprehension, adequate communication will satisfy the requirements. 2) The accused displayed an understanding of his situation through words and actions spanning a significant period of time. There was no evidence of mechanical defects or failures in the defendant's vehicle.  3) Although his degree of alertness may have been fluctuating and his emotions unstable, he nevertheless displayed an Understanding of His Situation Through Words and Actions. There is no evidence from medical personnel in this case to support the conclusion that the defendant was either high or intoxicated. The evidence tends to show that the drinking took place throughout that one-half hour period. 4) The Court found no error in the trial judge's interpretation of the import of s. 9(b). The accused had reasonable and probable grounds to make this demand."
b_2002skpc50.txt,"An application for a DNA warrant on the basis s.487.05 (the general warrant provision) of the Criminal Code with respect to DNA warrants does not refer to a form. The applicant suggested a tape recording would avoid the potential problems in bringing the application before a Provincial Court Judge. HELD: These concerns were raised in the January 21 decision concerning potential prejudicial or negative effects, which outweigh any requirement to swear the Information before a judge. An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance. The intention is to make protocol work as flexible as possible, not impeding the police in their legitimate role, while making sure the court maintains its independence. Form 5.01 is specifically set out in the Code. Section 487.1 does not have a form, but even if it did and used the same words 'taken before me', that would elevate form over substance in a significant way.","An application for a DNA warrant was made by the prosecutor and, pursuant to the Code, was accordingly directed that the courtroom be cleared. The application was to be made in camera and in accordance with the Code. Before doing that, there was an application with respect to a search warrant that ought to be make by the Crown. The officer was allowed to swear the Information to Obtain the Search Warrant. The court was of the view that the better practice is to put as much as you can in the Information as possible, especially in light of the concerns raised in the decision about the potential prejudicial or negative effects of a personal attendance before the judge. The potential negative effects or results outweigh any supposed requirement to swear Information before the Judge."

Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant applied to vary spousal support provisions of the Corollary Relief Judgment. Although the parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation, the divorce settlement and the agreement incorporated the terms of the parties' settlement of the property division issue, the applicant had previously obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1992 and her Masters in 1994. The respondent moved from the matrimonial home and was divorced in February 2003. The parties exchanged financial disclosure and provided the court with their affidavits and financial statements and both counsel were given the opportunity to cross-examine the opposing parties. Application allowed; the onus is on the applicant to satisfy the Court that the Agreement was not in substantial compliance with the objectives of the Divorce Act and that the Respondent did not take advantage of any vulnerability of the applicant. The Agreement included provisions that allowed the respondent to keep in force an unencumbered policy or plan of life insurance in an amount of not less than $175,000 for the duration of the marriage and thereafter in the sum of $4,535.00 for the period from November 1 to November 1, 2003 when the respondent received a lump sum to compensate the applicant for the underpayment of her rental income. There was no evidence of coersion or anything of that nature."
b_2007nsca75.txt,"A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit. Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.","The defendant was charged with the death of his sister and three others when his car veered off the road and struck a power pole. The accident victim, a farmer, claimed that he swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. Others brought an action against the defendant, alleging negligence in the ownership and operation of the vehicle. The chambers judge dismissed the summary judgment application, holding that the applicant had met the burden placed upon him in applying the test for summary judgment. The issue before the court was whether the chambers judge erred in the application or whether the judge misinterpreted the test. The test is well established and has been reiterated by the court in Milbury v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), [1999] N.S.J. No. 124 (Q.L.) (NSCA) and in Eikelenboom, [1988] BC. The requirement for leave to appeal an interlocutory order is found in Judicature Act s. 240 (d. 240), save by leave of the Court of Appeal. Rule 62.11 allows a third party to invoke Rule 13.01 to challenge a plaintiffs claim. In this case, the Chambers judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test and seemed to forget that there was at least a genuine issue that should be left to be determined at trial. He did not refer at all to the real chance of success test."
b_2010nssc125.txt,"The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","The plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay following the laying of criminal charges. They offered, however at their expense, the use of their legal counsel to defend the plaintiff. The plaintiff objected to the admission of the video re-enactment and the still photographs, as well as the opinions given by the RCMP Traffic Analyst regarding the amount of time that someone would have had to see the Chrysler and stop their vehicle. At trial, the plaintiff argued that the Crown's theory of the accident was fatally flawed and that its evidence should not have been introduced by the Crown, nor should counsel have referred to the theory in summation. Defence counsel should have raised a timely objection. The court found that the context of the manner in which the video was used at trial was one of factors that led it to conclude that the expert's opinion, although not admitted into evidence, was not properly considered at the time of trial and constituted breach of the appropriate standard of care."
b_2010skqb343.txt,"A class action was certificated at Queen's Bench on the basis of breaches of The Consumer Protection Act and a breach of duty of care. The defendants were granted leave from the Court of Appeal to appeal the portion of the certification order dealing with alleged breaches of The Consumer Protection Act only. The certification on the basis of duty of care was upheld. As a result, a situation existed where the class action process could continue on only part of the claim until the appeal of consumer protection act issues was heard. HELD: Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules is engaged and the entire certification judgment is stayed pending the disposition of the appeal. If the plaintiffs wish to apply to lift the stay they must do so to a judge of the Court of Appeal.","The defendants sought leave to appeal the certification order of the Consumer Protection Act (CPA) pursuant to s. 39(3)(a) of the Class Actions Act. They applied to leave the matter to proceed concurrently with the appeal on the CPA cause of action. A conference call was convened to address the issue of the next steps that should be taken. A decision on the leave application was rendered on August 26, 2010 and the matter was moved to a later stage of the conference call. The conference call convened in September 2010 at which time the parties were given the opportunity to speak to the topic of whether it was appropriate to move the matter forward. The matter was pending before the Court of Appeal and it was not known whether the class action would proceed on the basis of one cause of actions or two. HELD: 1)Leave was granted to appeal. Steps can now be taken to move this action forward, given that there is an appeal pending on only one aspect of the certification (the CPA). Steps were granted to bring this matter forward concurrently. 2)The situation that now exists is that the class actions will definitely advance, although, until after the appeal concerning the CAA cause of Action is finally determined, it is not unknown whether that class action will proceed on a one-cause of action or two basis. Steps could be taken at this time given the current situation. Steps must be taken in the context of the ongoing investigation into alleged breaches of the CFP Act, the breach of duty of care and breach of the duty of cares. 3)The plaintiffs were granted leave on the portion of the certification order that pertained to the cause for action relating to alleged breaches under the Consumer protection Act, S.S. 1996, c. C-30.1 (the ConsumerPA). All other aspects of the leave-to- appeal application, including that relating to the breaches of a breach of...of...the breach...of duty... cause ofaction, were dismissed."
b_2011skpc30.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care and control of a motor vehicle and care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.",The accused was charged with two counts being driving over.08 contrary to s. 253 of the Criminal Code and one count being impaired by alcohol. The accused was granted leave to cross-examine on the information to obtain blood samples as a result of the breach of his rights under s. 8 of the Charter to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. HELD: 1) The accused's blood alcohol concentration at the time of the accident was.08.  2) The Court found that the officer had not provided sufficient detail in the Information to Obtain so as to permit the Justice of the Peace to determine that reasonable grounds exist for the warrant to issue. The Certificate of Analyst and the report from the analyst were admitted into evidence at trial. 3) The officer omitted a crucial ground for his belief. The officer did not depose that the driver of the vehicle was unconscious. The information toobtain did not constitute reasonable grounds for the belief that the accused had committed an offence under ss. 253. 4) The warrant to search for blood was invalid. 5) The information was not a reasonable grounds upon which the authorizing judge could be satisfied that the relevant statutory pre-conditions of s. 256 of the Code existed.  6) There was a relatively narrow basis for exclusion and the accused was found to have failed to communicate the basic information required of a warrant to be issued. The Court held that the information was insufficient to invalidate the warrant.
b_2016skqb297.txt,"HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made. The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.","FIAT: The petitioner application for an order granting her exclusive possession of the family home, primary residence of the children and supervised access only for the respondent father. Although no reasons were given on the granting of the interim exclusive possession order, the petitioner raised concerns that the respondent had anger management problems that made her and their daughters fearful of him and addictions to pornography and masturbation that made it impossible for them to continue to reside in the same home. The respondent takes the position that this order should not have been granted in the circumstances of this case. HELD: 1) The evidence from the outset indicates that the petitioner wants the relationship to end and that increased contact between the respondent and the children would in fact be beneficial. 2) The Court cannot conclude that there is anything to be taken from this incident that demonstrates any improper behaviour on the part of the respondent. The evidence does not support this conclusion. 3) The petitioner's reasons for this application are based on her allegations that there was a recurring theme that the children only want her to put them to bed. 4) The respondent has been significantly involved in his daughters' lives, well beyond the level of many or most fathers who have normal work commitments. 5) It is not in the children's best interests to restrict access to that parent by imposing a minimum supervision access order. The petitioner has provided factual evidence as background to her opinion and much of it is expressly disputed by the respondent or to the extent allegations are acknowledged by the petitioner to have some factual basis, that evidence relates to significantly dated matters. 6) Counsel for the petitioner is not entitled to give weight to such allegations. The Court must consider the magnitude of the present harm, the probability of the harm the children might possibly suffer if they are subjected to the respondent's controlling and intrusive viewing of their children. 7) The court is unable to conclude that the increased contact would result in an artificial set of circumstances that militate against the fostering of a proper post-separation relationship."
c_1993canlii3443.txt,"This was an appeal of a decision which denied variation of a maintenance award where a lump sum had been previously ordered. The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court, that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation. The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances. Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of Family Court Judge Levy. Levy held that a lump sum payment made under the Family Maintenance Act could be varied after payment.

A custody investigation conducted in 1990 when the mother had first commenced this application had recommended that the existing arrangement be continued. The Father now intended, however, to move with the children to Ontario to take additional education. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed. She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children. 3)In the circumstances of this case the Judge was convinced that the move was reasonable and was not motivated by any desire on the part of the Father to thwart the Mother's access.","This was an application for an order varying the judgment of Dickson J. of the 5th of January 1990 in which he gave judgment for divorce and joint custody to the parents of two boys born April 22, 1984 and June 3, 1986. The mother had moved from Ontario to Saskatchewan, taking the children with her. The parties had entered into a separation agreement in 1988 in which the father agreed to joint custody, residence with the mother and generous access to the mother. In 1989 the mother brought an application to vary the judgment by granting the father sole custody of the boys, or joint custody with principal residence with mother. The father opposed the move. He argued that it would be in the best interests of the children to have them uprooted from their home in Melfort and move to a virtual paradise in Aurora. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The father was granted reasonable access.  2)The mother was granted generous access. 3)If the motive is simply to frustrate access, the Court would not allow the application. 4)The move was not to thwart the mother's wishes. The evidence showed that the father had, together with his present wife, the day to day care of the four boys from their early years onward, except when they were exercising the access to her. 5)The distance of the move was sufficient to permit the application under Divorce Act s.1(6) which provides that child should have as much contact with each spouse as possible. 6)The fact that existing custodial arrangements showed that a change in circumstances would result in the children moving to a completely new community was not an issue."

When his federal government management position was declared redundant, the applicant received a retiring allowance of $75,646 in May 1997. The respondent opposed the application on the basis there had been no change in circumstances since the judgment was granted; she had no other income than the support payments and child tax credit; alternatively, there were special provisions in the parties' separation agreement which would permit the court to award an amount that differs from the amount prescribed by the Guidelines.HELD: 1)The judgment the applicant sought to vary was made after the coming into force of the Guidelines. It did not however include a determination of child support made in accordance with the Guidelines. There was no change in the childrens' or mother's circumstances. The applicant was unemployed but was still benefiting from his retiring allowance at the time of the order which he no longer enjoyed. A variation was warranted as there had been a change in the father's financial means and circumstances. The Guideline support obligation for two children is $341 per month.  2)It could not be concluded on the evidence presented that there was any special provision in the parties' agreement that directly or indirectly benefited either child. The provision for child support in a specified amount greater than that provided in the Guidelines was not a 'special provision' as contemplated by s17(6.2) of the Divorce Act given the change in circumstances of the applicant whose annual income had dropped from $55,500 to $24,000 a year.  3)No order was made as to costs.","FIAT.

c_1999skqb178.txt,"Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute. The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in the proceeding, there were also questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial. HELD: The tapes were admitted to their entirety and were allowed to go in unedited. 1) Although the mother's recognition of past problems with depression and her progress in dealing with it through medication and counselling, the father was insistent that the tapes were of central importance to his case and that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated the abuse that was occurring in the mother’s home.  2) The tapes had the opposite effect of revealing the true character and motivations of the father, shedding little light on the mother. The tapes spoke volumes about the father”s character, motivations, and psychological well-being. They were primarily conversations between the father and the children, either individually or all together. There is really very little involving the mother directly. The parties separated on October 28, 1997 and a petition was immediately issued for custody of the 12 and 13 year olds. The mother was to have access on his scheduled days off work and the parties were to have a discussion about buying a bike and helmet for their upcoming birthday. 3) The father“sides” and “fears” were heard over and over again. There was no protection concerns and the 12 year olds had no fear of either parent. The parents were able to obtain joint custody with the father in the form of a consent order. The consent order stipulated that all telephone conversations should be recorded. The evidence gathered was that the father had threatened to kill the children if they did not get out of the house by the time he was 18 and that the mother was mentally ill and abusive to him and his children. It was also found that if he did not allow access, the children would suffer irreparable harm. 4) There were numerous incidents of verbal abuse between the parties that amounted to threats to the children and the parents were unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court. The abuse escalated when the mother became physically ill and verbally abusive to her children. The children were subjected to verbal abuse and physical torture by the father. 5) The videotaped conversations were found to have the effect of creating a hostile environment in which the father would be forced to deal with his own children for extended periods of time and would be in danger of losing custody of his children"

On July 12, 1999 Tapp filed notice with the registrar of the Court of Queen's Bench of his claim with respect to potential wage claims owing by the defendants company to its employees pursuant to s. 54 of The Labour Standards Act. At that time, the Labour Standards Branch filed notice in April with the court of the judge's decision regarding potential wage claim owing by Tapp's employer to its employee. On that date no certificate had been issued by the Minister. Tapp then served all the various interest and costs of this application by the Director of Labour Standards to be taxed. The latter had not been issued on the Minister's application in May 1999. Prior to the application the sum of $2,521.68 had been pay into court on March 30, 1999 on Q.B.G. 929 of 1999 and an additional amount was paid in on that file number in April of 1999.

The appellant contended the trial judge erred by failing to properly review and re-examine the evidence, in its entirely, with respect to the findings on credibility, reasonable doubt and other key issues. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant did not apply the wrong test. The trial judge applied the curative provision in s.686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code, which requires leave and is limited to questions of law. The error of law required to ground jurisdiction in the Court of Appeal is that of the summary conviction appeal court judge, not the trial court judge. On appeal, the appeal can be dismissed on the following grounds: 1) the appellant was clearly aware of the test by which he was to review the decision of the Provincial Court judge, who had admitted the audiotape evidence. 2) The appellant was not disinterested in discerning the test from the transcript and in reviewing the transcript. There was nothing in the decision to admit the tape that would raise issues concerning the fairness of the trial in the context of miscarriage of justice. 3) Even had there been an error, in these circumstances, the tape being non-conscripted evidence of an event about which all lay witnesses could and did independently testify, would have applied the Curative provision."

The first language of the respondent mother and the child is Inuktitut. The child, born in 1993, lived with the mother in Nunavut until 1999, when he moved to Nova Scotia to be with the father by agreement of both parties. This arrangement was not to exceed one year unless agreed to by the mother. Determining that the courts in both Nunavut and Nova Scotia have jurisdiction to deal with the issue of custody, that it was in the best interests of the child to remain in Nova Scotia and for the custody hearing to be held in Nova Scotia.","This was an application for custody of the child. The mother had previously resided with her father in Nova Scotia and the father had moved away from Nunavut before he knew the mother was pregnant. Due to the unavailability of translation services and obtaining a transcript, the mother had to spend considerable time with her estranged husband. She had problems with her new male relationship and with housing and means of support. There was also an unreasonable period of time from the date of the application to the decision of the Family Court. The court had great sympathy for the mother and her situation, as she was concerned about her son's welfare and sent him to Nova Scotia. The dilemma the court was faced with was to balance environment, parenting and cultural considerations. The child's father could provide the financial and environmental factors more satisfactorily while his mother had the cultural aspects such as an Inuit extended family and physical environment to enhance this and the Inuktitut language."

The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused. The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,"The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand to provide a sample of his breath by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to enable proper analysis of my breath to be made by means of an approved screening device.

The officer said he stopped the second test as the accused was blowing outside the mouthpiece again. He turned on the instrument. He waited for the ready light to come on. He got an imbalance signal from the machine. He stopped the first test and blew. He blew three times in all. 3)The mental element of the offence of refusal created by s.254(5) consists of intentional non-compliance. There was no reason to refuse a breath sample on the second and third try as the officer testified that he had three beers the whole night and he was in a rush. The last call came when they were at the pines just north of Prince Albert. After that the officer slowed down and he did not inform the accused of anything. He said he would be charged with refusal. 4)Although the accused had not told the young, inexperienced officer of why he thought he may have been having difficulty blowing sufficient sample for the officer, he had told the court he is asthmatic.

Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review. The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt. It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.","A cocaine fuelled encounter between the appellant and the woman with whom he was living resulted in his conviction for assault and sexual assault.

Both parties appealed the asset division; in the process, both parties sought to introduce fresh evidence. The wife also questioned the level of assistance offered by the trial judge to the husband who was self-represented at trial. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with the exception that the wife is to be given immediate access to her personal belongings; both applications to introduce fresh evidence dismissed; on the sparse record before him, the trial judge did not err in his division of assets and did not offer the husband unwarranted assistance as a self- represented litigant. Faced with two competing claims as to the amount of the proceeds of sale, if any, of one of the parties' properties, the trial judge committed no error in finding the amount owed to be half-way between the two claims and then setting it off against the amount owed to the other party.","The wife sought a more favourable division of assets and an entitlement to health insurance. She also sought an easement over the husband's property. The husband opposed this application, arguing that it would impede his ability to care for his sister. Allowing the cross-appeal, that the evidence was either readily available at trial, irrelevant, or both, and that the judge committed no reversible error. The award of the disputed 'camp property' was equal to the amount awarded to the wife. The judge found that the value of the assets held by the wife exceeded those retained by the husband due to their sale of the Chicago property and that this shortfall should at least justify her receiving all three Nova Scotia properties. The parties were married for four years and had just purchased a home in New York City. The trial judge found no palpable or overriding error in the manner in which he determined that the appraisals should be calculated. The evidence was found to be reasonably capable of representing the present value of assets."
c_2005nsca7.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant to provide banking, blending and lifting of coal at its coal preparation plant.

The employer argues that the plaintiff was dismissed for cause. HELD: 1) The employer spoke to the employee on three occasions about her work and by his own admission, the employee made an effort to improve. At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment. It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her. In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal. Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.  2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004. The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12. But for her dismissal, she would have worked for the rest of July and for the month of August or 36 days. 3) In this case the plaintiff made reasonable effort to seek and maintain employment.

The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions. The plaintiff is a councillor. The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the parties is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care. Her actions were not negligent.","The plaintiff sought general and aggravated damages for injuries suffered as a result of her actions as Reeve of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood.

She was free to discuss municipal issues with the ratepayers in his division and within the municipality and with the media and others. 2)The dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant was a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved.

c_2006skqb335.txt,"FIAT: The former vice-president of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan. He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour. He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application. Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart. It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart. The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart. HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed. The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart. Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations. Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart. However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. That is not good enough.","FIAT: Wal-Mart brought three applications. The first motion was brought by the applicant Wal-mart Canada Corp. which sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and Rule 673 prohibiting the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board as presently constituted from hearing and/or making any orders involving Wal-Marts. The second application was by United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 1400 which was added as a party with the consent of the applicant. In the first motion the Union seeks an order striking and removing virtually all of the material filed in support of the application. In both applications, the union applies for an order dismissing Wal's motion. HELD: 1) The relief sought by the Union should be granted and the application brought by Wal- Mart should be dismissed. Although there is no admissible evidence before the court, the account is accurate. The affidavits of the members of the Board are admissible. There is no necessity for their admission. Mr. Matkowski is around and about. He must be available to swear an affidavit. The critical allegations originate with him. Absent any explanation for his absence, there was no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proferred documents as evidence. At no time have the allegations been tested for accuracy and truthfulness. In reality, contradictions are found within the very documents. 2) Wal- mart's position that the actions of the unions, the interference by the Government and the presence of certain publications demonstrate that the Saskatchewan LRB is biased or, at the very least, there is a reasonable apprehension of bias against it. It is argued that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings which involve Wal's application. 3) The documents meet neither requirement. The affidavit of one Walter Matkowski with 39 exhibits is not sworn and as such is not admissible; the critical allegations originating with him have not been tested. The same is true of the defence filed denying the application by the union. 4) The statements of fact filed by the Department of Labour and the statements of claim by the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour together with the transcript of 'John Gormley Live' radio broadcast meet neither standard of necessity and reliability. 5) The admissibility of the comments by the Board members and the portions of correspondence which were critical and disparaging of Wal's company are of no interest to the Court. The statements by Wal's employees who were paid to watch radio broadcasts and to broadcast the radio broadcast are admissible."

Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make.

Although both she and her husband had good incomes, it would still take several more years to discharge the loans without prejudicing her family's reasonably frugal lifestyle. Relief granted; to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties. The bankrupt had acted in good faith and had been unable to service the loans in the early years when she did not have permanent employment. Compromising the debt and requiring her to only pay half of it was not an available option.","The Bankrupt, who had outstanding student loans of about $39,000, applied for relief under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.

c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused was charged with possession of a prohibited firearm and possession of ammunition contrary to s. 8 of the Criminal Code and possession with the intent to carry out a prohibited act. The evidence in relation to the firearms seized was that of a sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, a Lakefield Mark II rifle and ammunition, in a careless manner (contrary to Criminal Code s. 86(1) x 3), unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition in a prohibited manner (including the guns seized at the accused's mother's home and the possession of two over-capacity magazines) and that the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of the firearms at the residence with the mother. The intercepts were also of significant importance to the firearm trafficking charges. HELD: 1) The accused was found guilty on all charges.  2) He was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for possession of prohibited firearms and 12 months consecutive imprisonment for the same offence. 3) The Court was unable to accept the accused can assert a privacy interest in order to obtain protection of s.8 of the Charter and then, when that application goes badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. In any event, the evidence led by the Crown established that the phones and ammunition introduced as evidence in this trial were not the ones located in the appellant's and Torina Lewis' home. 4) The evidence was not resorted to. The accused did not have a Firearms Acquisition Certificate or any other kind of license for possessing firearms nor did he have a valid registration certificate for the firearms. 5) The Crown did not admit that the guilty pleas were relevant to the issue of the criminal liability on the firearms possession charges. 6) There was no evidence to refute the opinion of R. v.

The applicant’s proposed grounds of appeal were not questions of law but of fact.,"The defendant company appealed the Small Claims trial which found that the defendant had breached the contract but that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate its damages when, on June 2, it had declined the opportunity to finish seeding the Knudsen land. The defendant appealed, arguing the trial decision was unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence and that the trial judge had improperly interfered with the plaintiff's cross-examination of the defendant's witnesses. HELD: Leave to appeal was denied. 1)Leave to appeal should not be granted to the defendant company. 2)The trial judge did nothing improper in this regard. He merely attempted to keep the plaintiff on track in the presentation of his case and discouraged him from asking the same question multiple times.

c_2017skqb388.txt,HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered the removal of the respondent as an executor in the grant of probate and ordered that the applicants remain as executors but that they should take no further steps to distribute the assets of the estate. It found that there were “special circumstances” within the meaning of s. 17 of The Administration of Estates Act. The respondent was entitled to challenge the validity of the will but not entitled to remain as an executor.,"FIAT: The applicants ask the Court to remove the respondent as executor of the estate. They seek a revocation of the grant of probate and an order that the Will be proven in solemn form and related relief. HELD: 1) The respondent is removed as an executor pursuant to the Grant of Probate ordered by the Court of Queen's Bench.  2) The Court found no evidence that either of the parties had acted contrary to their obligations to administer the estate in accordance with the directions contained in the Will. 3) In an application seeking revocation of a grant or a order removing the respondent from being executor, the Court found that the respondent is refusing to co-operate in proper administration. The affidavit evidence of his sons, Kent and Rodney, satisfies the Court that this is something that Evan will not do.  4) The only conclusion drawn from the affidavit evidence was that neither of the brothers had acted in a fashion that is consistent with the will contained in it. The Court held that unless and until the grant/ probate was set aside and proof in a solemn form is ordered by this Court, the grant will remain operative and carries with it the obligation of the executors to continue to administer and the directions in the will."
d_1990canlii4118.txt,"In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice. The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment. The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months. He was also awarded the loss resulting from the difference in vacation and loss of an auto allowance for the 15 months. For emotional trauma, which lasted only briefly, he received $500.","This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff was assigned to work for the defendant company as an expatriate for four years. He received a salary of $60,000. In return, the defendant offered him a position as a senior geophysicist. The position was based on a contract between the parties that required the plaintiff to give 30 days notice of termination if the company desired to terminate the contract. The defendant refused, and the plaintiff went into deep depression. He claimed that he could leave the company on three months notice but that the company had no right to give him 3 months notice. He applied to the Federal Civil Service for a position in the position of regional manager in Nova Scotia, but was denied. He sought damages for breach of contract. Dismissing the action, that (1) the defendant did not have cause to dismiss the plaintiff; (2) the plaintiff was entitled to reasonable notice; (3) the 30 day notice provision if applied would be harsh; and (4) the defendants had not demonstrated that reasonable notice had not been given by them."

He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company (STC). The plaintiff was the former president and chief executive officer of the provincial Crown corporation.STC awarded damages against the corporation in the basic amount of $165,000. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as might have occurred in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum; and third, that all of the plaintiff's Crown corporation service should have been calculated on the premise his annual salary was $102,000 rather than $110,000 less. The plaintiff resisted the attribution on pragmatic grounds arguing that the company had not paid any salary, that there was no guarantee the company was going to earn profit, that it needed working capital, and so on. Finally, the plaintiff contended that the $12,000 severance payment should not have been attributed to him for the purpose of mitigation as he had been in the employ of the Crown in the right of the Province for more than a decade and had met his legal duty to mitigate but had not succeeded in reducing his loss. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The trial judge made no error in the facts. The severance terms of the contract were arrived at at, as noted, with an eye to his earlier service and were not inflated. 2)Mitigation was not allowed. 3)Costs on appeal."

d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","This was an appeal from a decision in an interpleader application by the Band Council to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owing by the respondent Band under a construction contract entered into with the respondent. The respondent had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specified to the various claimants. The agreed upon terms of the contract for the construction of residential homes on the Reserve were confirmed by a letter to the respondent's solicitor instructing him to pay the respondent funds which he had received from the respondent in the form of a bank draft payable to the Band in trust. The Chambers judge held that s. 89(1) of the Indian Act was applicable and set aside the provisions intended to prevent an Indian from entering into normal financing agreements in conjunction with the operation of commercial business. He also held that the accounts receivable of the respondent were not property of an Indian and therefore their rights were to be determined exactly as if the Act had never been passed. Allowing the appeal, that the Chambers judge erred in his interpretation of s.89(1). The Act does not either expressly or impliedly confer any greater right upon an assignee of a chose in action that he had before. When an Indian is in business he holds and deals with his or her business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all other Canadians. By registration the plaintiff has preserved whatever rights it acquired by virtue of the assignment and no more. The assignment as such transferred to the plaintiff no rights in the choses in action which were recognised at common law. Its efficacy was based solely upon principles of equity with the additional statutory right given to an assignor to bring action in his own name, instead of that of the assignor. This is not the effect of registration under the Act. The Act was never intended by the Legislature to give priority to competing assignees based on the dates of registration."

The deceased and applicant who had been living together purchased residential property in 1997. Their lawyer prepared a written agreement for the sellers and purchasers as well as the mortgage describing the purchasers as joint tenants. The sellers, unrepresented by legal counsel, prepared the transfer of the property and title issued without the words 'joint tenants'. The error describing the purchasers went unnoticed by their lawyer. The respondent had been married to the deceased when he died intestate in 1998. As the title stood an undivided one-half interest was owned by the estate and would devolve to the respondent pursuant to the Intestate Succession Act.

Rochon were satisfied. There was an obvious mistake which required rectification. The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did. 2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.","FIAT.

d_2002skqb80.txt,"The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.","The applicant Credit Union loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. The respondent's wife had apparently been the person who used the vehicle under the registration agreement but she was never the registered owner of the vehicle until she acquired it from her husband's estate. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made the respondent aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period between September 11, 2001, to November 14, 2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The wife sought to defeat the bank's security interest upon the ground that she was at all times the real owner and was always in possession of the car. All other indicia of ownership were in her favour. The Court held that ownership does not depend upon registration. There are many unregistered vehicles. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour the holder of a registration certificate and as matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership."

At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the defence brought a motion to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, such evidence flowing from an invalid approved screening device demand, which infringed the accused's s.8 and s.9 Charter rights. At issue was whether the arresting officer formed the requisite belief necessary to make roadside demand pursuant to s.254(2). More specifically, whether the officer's determination that the accused motorist had 'consumed alcohol' was sufficient to bring it within the parameters of this section. HELD: 1)The words 'had consumed alcohol' were insufficient insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in his body at the time of the ASD demand. 2)Evidence of consumption manifested by physical observation and/or through dialogue with the motorist may well provide such a reasonable person's reasonable suspicion. The threshold is far lower than the required belief to make a formal breath demand. The wording of s.24(2) is clear and unambiguous. It does not leave a trier of fact with the necessity of drawing inferences that consumption of alcohol at some point in itself equates to having alcohol in the body. 3)There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the second count, same is dismissed against the accused."
d_2005nsca104.txt,"The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday. He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","The appellant father was ordered to pay maintenance for his son pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act. The issues on appeal were: 1) whether the father had withdrawn and was unable to withdraw from his parent's charge; 2) if so, how long the child's period of dependency had continued; and 3) whether there was any evidentiary basis upon which the judge could conclude that the Guideline amount was inappropriate and therefore depart from it. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs payable by the father to the mother in the amount of $2,000 together with disbursements as taxed or agreed. 1) the evidence was not persuaded that the judge erred in concluding that the child had not withdrawn and that it was his intention at that time, and still is, to further his education at a post-secondary educational institution.  2) the judge did not err in finding that the dependency continued if the child was not a dependent child within the definition of 'dependent child' as defined in s. 2(c) of the Act. It was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.  3) the wording of certain grounds of appeal presume an interpretation of the judge's decision which is not supported on a careful reading of the judgment 4) the standard of review is not to suggest that a parent has an indefinite responsibility to support a child who is capable of becoming independent. A parent does, however, have an obligation to assist a child through a reasonable transition period."

There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","The appellant appeals his conviction by Crawford, J.P.C. on a charge of sexual assault. The appellant testified at trial denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant argued that his conviction is a miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his testimony on material misapprehensions of the evidence. He also submits that the judge found him to be a liar because he claimed to have been good to the children when he was responsible for physically abusing and starving them. HELD: The conviction is set aside and a new trial ordered. 1) The court found a number of grounds for dismissing the appellant's evidence. The trial judge misapprehended evidence. 2) The judge ascribed to the evidence about the involvement of Children's Services, relevance that it simply could not have. The inference drawn from this evidence could not be more unjustified. 3) The Court found a pattern of reasoning not available to the judge in law or in logic on this record and therefore failed to give proper effect to it."

The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle at the time of the accident when she was struck from behind. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence that there were no brake lights on the defendant's vehicle, it would still be a haphazard guess to assess whether any injuries sustained were not minor injuries. Defendant brought an application for summary judgment on the basis that there had not been an independent medical examination of the plaintiff and it was unnecessary for the court to process the evidence. Application for summary judgement dismissed; there was no 'air of reality' to the defence; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and medical evidence at trial. The plaintiff had made a significant claim yet when one listens to defendant's counsel and reads the material attached to his affidavit, one concludes there is a significant amount of other factors relating to the plaintiff' health. Judgement entered against the defendant in the cause of the action."
d_2006nsca124.txt,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent, who challenged the validity of a search warrant issued by the judge who excluded evidence obtained in the search of her home. The Crown alleged the judge erred in law by failing to apply the proper standard of review. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the judge misapplied the standard upon which he was to review the decision. The court found the warrant was quashed in error. The warrant had been valid, the search was lawful and there was no allegation that it was otherwise unreasonable. However, the evidence obtained as a result of the search had been wrongly excluded and the result would not necessarily have been the same. The appeal court found that even had the warrant been quashed, the findings of the FLIR testing and observations were not sufficiently strong or probative to confirm the existence of the marihuana grow operation and to overcome the weaknesses in the source's information. Therefore, the trial judge properly applied the test. There was no breach of s. of the Charter or of the merits of the trial, but rather an extricable legal error."

d_2007skqb266.txt,"FIAT: The primary issue is whether the father should pay for tutoring expenses. HELD: 1) The father is not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance. However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400.","FIAT: The Court ordered a number of orders regarding child support and an order regarding summer access. The remaining issues were: what, if any, should the father pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children? The mother proposed that Kody be registered in the Sylvan Learning Centre during the summer of 2007 due to his educational difficulties. Although it is clear from the evidence that the mother has an entitlement to interim spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. HELD: 1)The child support application was made pursuant to s.15.3(1) of the Divorce Act. Section 7(1)(d) provides that the Court may make a retroactive child support order if it determines that the costs are necessary and reasonable. 2)The childcare costs and Sylvan learning centre costs were within the father's means. The father's contribution of 71% of the total cost was sufficient to determine the approximate net monthly cash flow of $2,700. 3)The cost of the Childview program with childcare costs of $7,800 per year, the childcare costs at $1,261, income for the father at $37,900 and the mother at $13,085, together with Sylvan fees, would equate to $472 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Court believed the costs of the childview program, with childcare, books and lessons, plus the cost of Sylvan, would be necessary, reasonable and proportionate to 71 per cent of total cost. The cost of all of the children's school activities, including tutoring, was an amount equal to 71%of the total costs.  4)The father was to pay costs in the sum of $400. The mother was to bring this motion to obtain an appropriate sharing of s. expenses.  5)The Court was unable to make any retroactive order because the father had not taken steps to research alternative programming. The Court determined that the matter, at this interim stage, should not affect the right of the mother to pursue spousa support in the future. Although both the mother and father acknowledge that the father did commence making reasonable child support payments as of February 2007, it was clear that they had not commenced any of the programming options that were available at the time of the application.  6)There was significant conflict on the evidence regarding the payment of loans by the father during this period of time and the issue of whether or not the mother refused"
d_2009nssm48.txt,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This was an appeal by the landlord from an order of the Director which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy, but also denied the landlord's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the tenant effectively refused to renew for another year. The Landlord appealed. Appeal allowed; the tenancy has not been converted into a Month to Month tenancy because the landlord refused his consent in a timely manner for reasons beyond the control of either the landlord or the tenant. The landlord has the advantage of the Landlord's undertaking to accept an early termination on any date from May 31, 2010 (his undertaking refers to 2009), or perhaps he would have had the option to vacate immediately. The tenant requested an earlier date be set given that he has acted in good faith and had no way of knowing that his effort to convert the tenancy into a monthly to month would be thwarted. The Tenant requested that an earlier time be set because he has seen the lease expire and he would be exposed to the very financial consequences that he seeks to avoid."

The question was whether the Crown's evidence was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant and whether the Crown was able to prove non-consent beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The Court did not know whom to believe and the accused was acquitted.,"The accused was charged with common assault and common assault. The issue was whether the evidence of the Crown was sufficiently credible to prove non-consent beyond a reasonable doubt. The only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the offence of common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Court did not know who to believe and he was not found guilty of s. 267 of the Code. However, it did know that the accused had walked fast because he was angry with the complainant and had made some comments that he would stab or hit the complainant's father because he called her a bitch. It was apparent that there was a great deal of animosity and bad blood between the parties and there were no other witnesses in the room at the time. The accused's testimony was that he had accidentally allowed the baby to slip from his grasp while removing a Jolly Jumper. The complainant had said that the father had pushed her down on the floor with both hands on her chest and she struck her head on the dresser. Her father advised that he heard a thump from the bedroom when the two of them were in there alone. He was not able to see what had happened in the house so he went to the bedroom to check on the baby. Finally, his mother advised that she had seen the baby fall or slip from the other side of the house and that her father had gone to the bathroom to cool off. The mother was unable to see the whole event and had sent the accused to her bedroom to deal with the screaming. The father departed from the room. The court found nothing which would have affected the credibility of the material witnesses."

Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so. While a dismissal of the criminal appeal is a serious remedy, since it means it will never be heard on its merits, the appellant has made it clear that she cannot provide certified transcripts unless the court orders the respondents to pay. The court has already declined to do so. There is no suggestion a further extension of time will result in the appellant perfecting the appeal.","The appellant appealed the June 29, 2011 decision of the Criminal Appeal Court which held that she had committed the act of public mischief when she reported an offence of assault with weapon to an RCMP officer, causing him to enter an investigation, when the alleged offence had not been committed and she was not criminally responsible with respect to this charge. The appellant applied to have the respondents pay for the preparation and certification of the 1,700 pages of transcript she wanted to put before the court on her 2nd and 3rd appeals. The respondents' motions to dismiss her Criminal Appeal and to have them pay to certify the transcripts were granted. The Court dismissed the appellant's first two appeals for failure to perfect, CAC 341990, and CAC 352311. The second appeal was dismissed on the basis that the appellant had not provided certified transcripts by the time she filed her notice of appeal in the Civil Appeal and that no dates had been set for the filing of the required materials or the hearing of the appeal because of the respondent's seeming inability to comply on timely basis with the Rules. It would be unsafe to rely on uncertified transcripts."

MLG was unable to explain how cross-examination would assist the Court. As well, the application to cross-examine did not appear to rest on a real need to clarify any issues relevant to the application for which the affidavits had been filed and focused on the relative merits of legal issues rather than on evidentiary issues.","The defendants applied for carriage of the proceedings in Saskatchewan and for leave to cross-examine on affidavits filed by the plaintiff and the defendant in opposition to the defendants' application for carriage. HELD: The applications were dismissed. The court emphasized the importance of providing a proper evidentiary record for the resolution of the issues raised by the application, including clarification of ambiguous evidence, expanding or narrowing the scope of what is said in an affidavit, or exploring matters going to the credibility of the affiant. The fundamental questions were not raised in the affidavits but in the brief of law. The affidavits were not filed in relation to an application for certification. The defendants filed affidavits that dealt with the progress of the credit card class action litigation in this and other jurisdictions."
d_2016skpc75.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay. As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered. The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay. The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable.","The accused, charged with 56 offences, including conspiracy to commit the indictable offence of fraud by printing and/or cashing forged cheques, defrauding or attempting to defraud contrary to s. 380(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, possession of proceeds of crime contrary to ss. 354(a) and 355(b)of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and possession of a counterfeit mark contrary to section 376(2)(b). The accused sought a judicial stay of proceedings on the basis that he had not established on a balance of probabilities that there had been a breach of his right to be tried within a reasonable time. HELD: The accused was dismissed from the notice of Charter application pursuant to section 11(b).  1) The accused had no interest in an early trial and society's interest would not parallel that of the accused. 2) There is a societal interest that is by its very nature adverse to the interests of an accused. Society as a whole has an interest in seeing that the least fortunate of its citizens who are accused of crimes are treated humanely and fairly. In this respect trials held promptly enjoy the confidence of the public. As the seriousness of the offence increases so does the societal demand that the accused be brought to trial. In some cases, however, the accused has not established that there has been an unreasonable delay in the conduct of his trial. As a result of this unreasonable delay, the Court has dismissed the application for a stay of the proceedings."

The Legal Profession Act, 1990 provides for an order for an inquiry into the conduct of members of the Law Society of Saskatchewan as they progress through criminal matters. The hearings were held intermittently, often by telephone conference calls, and the matter was adjourned from time to time. HELD: The appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Canada on March 21, 1995 and the Hearing Committee set August 8, 1995 as the date for a hearing. The respondents have lost jurisdiction to take further proceedings against the applicant. 1)The applicant was a paid-up practising member of the law society. He was granted an inactive membership. He did not pay any inactive membership fee. 2)Although stay of proceedings was ordered for the period from August 1989 until January 1990, it was incumbent upon the respondents to move without delay before the stay was granted and after it was lifted on the application of the respondents. This the respondents did not do to the detriment of the applicant's interests. 3)The respondent's failure to provide proper notice to the chairperson of the hearing committee and timely notice of sentencing on the matters referred to in the report of the Discipline Committee were grounds of disqualification."

HELD: All three children were committed permanently to the Minister. 1)The mother appeared to be more anxious about excusing the father, who was an abusive alcoholic, than about protecting the children. The mother was unable to parent any of the children on her own. It was concluded under s.11(b) of the Act that there was no adult person able and willing to provide for the children's needs and physical or emotional harm may come to the children if it had not already. 2)The father had recently pleaded guilty to sexual assault on an eight year old girl which could, depending on the facts be a ground under s.11(a)(iii) of the Act for a finding of need for protection.",The Minister of Social Services sought an order permanently committing to the Minister all three of the children of the Department permanently committing them to their mother.

e_1999nsca134.txt,"The appellant was granted release pending appeal, on conditions. The Crown applied for a review. The Crown contended that the Chambers judge misinterpreted the definition of custody in granting the application, as the appellant was on day parole at the time of the application. Dismissing the application, that day parole with a requirement to return to a halfway house each night is a form of custody which allows for an application and release under s. 679 of the Code.","The Crown applied for release pending appeal pursuant to s. 679 of the Criminal Code when the appellant at the time of the application was on release from the federal penitentiary on day parole granted by the National Parole Board under Part ll of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.

The appellant applied for a review under s. 680(1) of the Code on the same date as the amended order. After reviewing the decision of Justice Cromwell and without any new precedents being provided by the Crown following an opportunity to do so, the Crown sought a written decision. The Crown relied upon its submission that the appellant, who was on day custody at the relevant time at the instant time of his application, was not in custody. They raised a number of issues, including whether the Chambers judge erred in law in ruling that at the appropriate time, the appellant was in custody within the meaning of s.679 of The Code. Counsel for the Crown argued that the trial judge misinterpreted the definition of custody by granting the 679 application. Counsel also argued that a panel of the Court of Appeal should be convened to consider the issues.

e_2000canlii4625.txt,"The accused was charged with four offences relating to a twelve year old girl, including sexual assault and uttering a threat. He was released on bail with a surety. The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 771 for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into the accused. The accused was charged with four offences with respect to a twelve year old girl who allegedly disappeared in December 1997. At the time of his release from prison, the accused had suffered serious injuries in an automobile accident. He had not been gainfully employed since that time and had been dependent on social assistance for his subsistence. HELD: The applications for forfeiture were dismissed. The surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizizance and he mistakenly believed that his responsibilities or liability ended with the accused's first appearance in Court following his release. Certainly he was not aware that he himself could be subject to imprisonment under s.773 in the event of default and was not made aware of that fact.  1) The accused's disability was not a factor to be considered. The ability to pay surety was.  2) It would not be just and appropriate to order forfeiture on the part of the surety. The court had discretion whether to order it against the accused or both."

The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln. Fair was convicted of trafficking in marihuana and possession for the purpose of trafficking and Brooks was found not guilty on both counts. The Crown alleged that Brooks consented to Fair's submission being viewed as an application by her for relief from forfeiture under s. 20(4). Brooks had been the registered owner of the vehicle at the time of the offence and had resided in it for the night. She had stayed in hotel with the Fair family. The parties were travelling through Calgary when the police stopped the vehicle. Brooks was driving the vehicle and was in the front seat when the trunk was searched. The police found 28.3 pounds of marijuana in two plastic blue tubs stacked one on top of each other in the trunk of the car. Brooks had used the vehicle for overnight stays and had checked in with the RCMP once in a while. The affidavit deposed that she had loaded our luggage in the car as usual and had seen some crumbs of marijuana. Brooks did not dispute the assertion that the crumbs had not fallen on the floor but had no idea how long they had been there. She also exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied the property was not likely to be used in the commission of a designated substance offence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)Sole and institutional forfeiture is not cruel and unusual punishment. It is available to the general public. 2)The Crown did not demonstrate a standard of punishment available to persons charged with the designated substance offences. 3)The Court must consider the gravity of the offense, the personal characteristics of the offender and the interests of the person who were permitted to obtain possession of the property. The Court must also consider the nature and extent of the interest. 4)The Lincoln was owned by Brooks. It had not been questioned that she was the owner."

The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The plaintiff had been in the produce department of the store at around 3:45 p.m. when she suddenly slipped on a puddle of water on the floor. She was taken to the Pasqua Hospital Emergency Department where she was bandaged, given painkillers and advised to rest and see her family doctor if her injuries did not improve. Some of the injuries were at least in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. 2)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on the Floor of a grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. The defendant did not know the water was there but did know that water and other substances could be in the floor of the produce store and also knew that reasonable steps must be taken to safeguard against the very type of accident experienced by the general public. 3)The plaintiff did not submit to any evidence that the defendant cleaned the floor at 2:52 pm on a daily basis. There were no logs of any of the company's employees doing any work at the time of the accident. The logs showed that floors were regularly cleaned at least once per hour during the period ending April 1. 4)There were no log entries showing any employees who had worked at the store prior to or during the incident."

The evidence of impairment was too weak to convict the appellant. The officer told the accused that if he passed the ALERT test, he would be sent on his way.

The wife opposed the application arguing the lay-off was only temporary and that the child continued to be a child of the marriage within its meaning. HELD: 1) The husband's obligation to contribute to the child's riding lessons was terminated effective March 31, 2003. 2) The wife's application to increase the husband's contribution for her son's extracurricular activities was dismissed. It was only the generosity of the husband that kept the Court from making a reimbursement order. The parties' current income was $37,416 as of May 2002 and the husband was laid off prior to filing of his application for variation. The Court found that the wife's position warranted an assessment of costs as the child had not followed through with her plan and was unable to afford the expenses herself. 3) If the wife followed through on her plans and actually commenced post-secondary education she may requalify as a 'child of themarriage' under s. 14 of the Guidelines. Should the wife follow through and actually commence the education she seeks to attain? The husband was ordered to pay $54 per month in child support for the child.Spent money for school and paying off debts did not constitute an 'other cause' as contemplated in the definition of 'child' as envisaged by the Diva Act. The child had been in full-time attendance at a Post-secondary institution. She was paying $100 per month towards her debt to SGI.

At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter.

The Defense had verballyized an intention to raise s. 8 and s. 9 Charter motions and lead evidence. The applicant retained counsel and was prepared to fight the merits of the case at trial. Prejudice can be inferred on the length of the delay from the date the information was sworn September 29, 2002 to the date set for commencement of trial December 18, 2003.

The application parallels that of Gerwing J.A., who decided on February 25th, prior to the final reasons being filed, not to lift a stay and to maintain the schedule existing before the decision under appeal. Since oral argument, when the mother assumed that maintenance would be paid, the father's counsel filed a detailed brief arguing that staying the execution of Klebbuc J.'s judgment did not revive the prior maintenance order and that a Court of Appeal chambers judge does not have the authority to make such an order. HELD: The application to raise the custody and access provisions in place prior to Klebuca J.'s judgment gives the mother custody of the children for slightly more than 50% of the time. This raises the question as to whether she has sufficient resources to care for these children appropriately. Given all the circumstances of this case, it was appropriate for the Court to interpret the effect of the order declining to lift it in this case.  1) The Court had concluded that the case was more like Faber v. Retzlaff,[1] Fiacco v. Fiacco[2] and Fick v. Fick [3] than Latsay, Kuhn, Bitternose,[4] Burke v. Burke[6] and Murray v. Murray.[7] In the former cases, the chambers judge determined that the best interests of the parents required the status quo to be maintained. The Court did not reach the same conclusion in the present case. 2) While the delay since interim reasons were filed on December 4, 2003 has resulted in a new status quo, there has been only during that period when the children did not have access to both parents in any six-day period (leaving aside the January vacation which appeared to be part of the current status quo). This is to be contrasted with the access proposed by the father for the upcoming two months which would see the children not having overnight access, or indeed, any access, to their mother during four 6-day periods until the appeal is heard."
e_2004skpc82.txt,"The accused youth is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions. However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.","The accused was charged that he did operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges.  1)The accused did not show any signs of impairment. His blood alcohol concentration was at or near.08. 2)The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong smell of alcohol and a flushed face. 3)On the Crown evidence, the accused was operating his vehicle in light traffic. He was exceeding the speed limit and had failed to signal lane changes. As well, although the vehicle wandered somewhat within its lane, it did not stray into the other lane of traffic. 4)The Court concluded that in the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for these tests, the proper method of application and to comment on their reliability, it was not appropriate for the court to rely upon them on the issue of guilt or innocence, to the prejudice of the accused. 5)There was no evidence of impairment on the Crown's part. The accused had been driving his vehicle erratically for two and a half hours prior to the stop. The Crown's claim that the accused had consumed only one bottle of beer (1.1 litre of beer) and that he had passed the only other vehicle in the immediate vicinity was not supported by the evidence. The Court found that the Crown must prove that its evidence is credible. 6)Evidence of impairment was not offered as an explanation for the failure to signal. 7)No medical evidence was offered as a result of the alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption was not a reliable indicium of impairment due to the consumption of alcohol. Alcohol was not involved in the decision to stop the vehicle as the officer observed the vehicle make an abrupt lane change twice without signalling. 8)No reasonable inference could be drawn as to impairment by alcohol. 9)The evidence of non-alcoholic content in the car was not reliable. Alcohol content was not found to be a reliable indicator of impairment and the Court found no reasonable inference as to the presence of drugs in the vehicle. Alcohol concentration was high and the accused appeared to have had some alcohol consumption prior to driving. Alcohol intake was high, but not as high as the Court would have expected it to be. Alcohol and marijuana consumption were not considered factors. 10)The Crown offered no reasonable explanation for their failure to offer an explanation"

HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict. 2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant. The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct. The offence of dangerous driving was established and the accused was found guilty. 4) The accused was found guilty of two counts of assault.",The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and with aggravated assault in the manner of the accused when he drove his truck dangerously close to the complainant while she was laying on the driveway. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) The evidence was accepted. The accused's evidence was not seriously affected by cross-examination. The Crown had proven the guilt of him beyond a reasonable doubt on all of the counts. 2) The accused operated the motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public and the Crown proved the accused's guilt to the satisfaction of a reasonable person. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct. 3) The Court found the accused guilty of the charge of lying in wait for the accused to testify.
e_2005skpc8.txt,"The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged that he committed a sexual assault on the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1) The complainant was employed as clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and although she testified that she knew of the accused in 1999, it was much more likely that she met him in the spring of 2002 after he assumed his duties as Justice of the Peace in the same building. The Court found that the accused had not been detained and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) had been infringed. 2) The accused's evidence was examined. It was clear that the complainant had been sexually assaulted by the accused and that he had responded to her allegations by making comments to her that she should not take lightly. The accused believed that in light of the conversations that he and she had had prior to the charges, there was never any indication that she wasn't consenting to it. The evidence showed that the relationship between the complainant and the accused was one of mutual respect and that the exchange of pleasantries and phone calls was part of the conversation. 3) There was some consistency as to the incidents that occurred prior to August 21st, 2003. However, the same cannot be said about the events in August 2003. 4) The testimony of the complainant who was paying attention to various documents at the court building was not consistent with the events described in the statement. The statement could not be used in cross-examination for the purpose of attacking the credibility of the witness."

The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action.

The defendants opposed the certification application on the basis that none of the five criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act had been met by the applicant. The plaintiff states that the plaintiff was negligent in not taking appropriate precautions and should have made alternate arrangements or taken additional precautions to ensure that there were no excessive delays. Regarding the plaintiff's claim for damages against Air Canada, the Court notes that Air Canada has incorporated into its Act the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999 relating to carriage by air. In this case, the plaintiff alleged damages against the Air Canada and its subsidiaries for alleged negligence, breach of contract or breach of a contract by the airline.

e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. The only evidence led in the voir dire at the trial was that of the police officer who stopped the respondent in a routine traffic stop of vehicles entering Saskatoon from the east. After the officer determined that he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe the respondent was operating his motor vehicle while impaired, he arrested the respondent, read the respondent his right to retain counsel and gave the requisite police warning. The Certificate of Analysis was excluded from the evidence. HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1) In reviewing the evidence that was before the learned trial judge, the judge could not have reasonably reached the conclusion he did, and the evidence falls far short of proving that respondent was frustrated. Impatient, probably, but not frustrated. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer in order to reach the conclusion that the respondent had changed his mind about seeking legal advice. 2) The lack of Prosper warning does not mean the respondent’s waiver was not valid. The respondent was given an unequivocal waiver once he realized that he was in breach of the Crown’S Charter rights. 3) The Crown did not provide unequivocal warning to the accused. The Crown was not required to explain the reasoning behind the waiver. 4) The appeal must be in accordance with the role permitted of the appellate court."
e_2006skqb534.txt,"The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","HISTORICAL REVIEW: The respondent applies to vary child support orders and/or alleged agreement struck by the petitioner and the respondent in or about July 2003. The respondent seeks to vary pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act and s. 10 of The Family Maintenance Act. In addition to a variation of the amount of child support, the respondent asks that the variation order apply retroactively to July 1, 2003.  1) There is no evidence that an agreement was struck. The petitioner and respondent agreed in 1999 that the respondent would continue to have joint custody of the children. However, in 1997 the respondent made an informal adjustment to monthly child support to become $380.00 per month. This became the prevailing course of conduct without the formality of either court order or formal agreement. 2) The petitioner did not engage in blameworthy conduct. The annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 3) There was no agreement or obligation to disclose the tax return on June 30, 2004 and each June 30 thereafter. 4) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of support for both children. 5) The Court cannot find any reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding the respondent accepted $380 as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 until July 2006."

Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at St. Francis Xavier University when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the professor did not take the content of the attachment as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to cause death to the professor. The appellant did not have a lawyer when he stood his trial in provincial court. No formal amendment of the grounds of appeal was sought but the appellant's brief also argued that the verdict was unreasonable. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge did not enter a voir dire to determine if the appellant had any relevant evidence. He simply directed that the trial judge could ask the appellant what the intention of the e-mail was and that the words were meant to intimidate or be taken seriously. 2) The evidence raised no issues with the admissibility of evidence, the appropriateness of questions asked of the appellant in cross-examination, the impact on the integrity and fairness of the trial, the elements of the offence that the Crown needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt and was there sufficient evidence that would permit a reasonable trier of fact, properly instructed and acting reasonably, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on those elements."
e_2009skca40.txt,"This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","This was an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant sought to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake. The facts briefly are that the appellant, a widow, agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including a residence and some grain bins, to the respondents, the Clements, by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000 allocated $100,000 for the land and $20,000. The terms were indeed favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over 7 years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and property taxes until December 31, 2006. The issues raised were factual and the standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) had been met. The trial judge concluded that the plaintiff, when she entered the contract, had full capacity. She saw no reason on the evidence to doubt her competence and that is fully supported by her testimony at the trial when she was in her late 80's. The contract was advantageous to both parties as it was reasonably foreseeable that the subject of the value of the land would not be appropriately discussed until the very end of her lifetime."
e_2010skca79.txt,"The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. The appellant appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter was too severe. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons.  1) The issues identified by the appellant do not operate to make his convictions unreasonable. The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She underscored that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) When the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not in any way left with the impression that, if it was the appellant who was driving the white Tempo, it somehow followed the driver of the other vehicle. The evidence raised by the trial judge clearly indicated to the jury it could not place a special, or indeed any, weight on the appellant's assessment of his veracity. In her charge, the judge instructed the jury to treat police witnesses like any other witnesses when assessing their testimony. The jury was alerted to these facts and were required to consider whether the appellant could have outrun the Constable Badger, who was in the patrol car at the time of the car chase. These were issues that should have been put aside and an appeal of the convictions and sentence appeals dismissed."
e_2011skqb134.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of using credit card data to fraudulently obtain services contrary to s. 342(3) of the Criminal Code, one count of fraud over $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1) of the Criminal Code for defrauding Sasktel of telephone services and one count of fraudulently personating various persons with intent to gain advantage for himself contrary to s. 403(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44. The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items. The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18. The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail. He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders. In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities. He plead guilty. HELD: A fit sentence in global terms for these offences would be 8 years and 6 months. The accused was given credit for 4 years and 9 months for the time he spent in custody. The accused was sentenced to 2 years and 3 months for the s. 342(3) offence, 1 year and 6 months consecutive for the offence under s. 380(1) and 2 years concurrent for the personation offence under s. 403(a). The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","The accused was charged with two counts of fraud. The Crown stayed the count and imposed a global sentence of eight years and six months. The accused plead guilty to three counts of theft. The sentences were varied to correspond to the gravity of the offence, the time actually served on remand. HELD: The global sentence was reduced to four years and nine months from the total of 10 years and 9 months. 1) The accused pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud Saskatchewan Telecommunications of services and goods of a value exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and one count for fraudulently obtaining goods and services by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means contrary to ss. 403(a) and (b)of the Code. 2) The offence was very high because of a number of aggravating circumstances. The offences were pursued over a lengthy period of time and involved scores of transactions. There were many individuals and businesses subjected to embarrassment and anxiety. 3) The Court imposed a combined sentence of 8 years and 6 months, which was eight years six months and a credit of four years nine months, concurrent with the preceding sentences. 4) It was also mindful that the accused pleaded guilty. While it was long time in coming, it has avoided lengthy trial and the attendant expense. What is even more important is the necessity that many people testify and go through the consequent discomfort. For that, the accused deserves credit. 5) The conduct of the accused was most unusual in that it occurred while he was in prison. It involved many separate acts and required participation by several individuals with the accused as the co-ordinator.  6) The credit should be one for one, or put otherwise, the amount actually served by the accused, in the result of 1,336 days and the global sentence should be reduced accordingly. 7) The discretion to grant the credit remains with the Court despite s. 719(3) and s. 670(4) because the offences were committed and the charges brought before enactment of the section.  7) It is denunciation and deterrence, both in the accused and others, which must be emphasized and obtain a priority. Any other approach would be disrepute."
e_2011skqb244.txt,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","The appellant appealed his conviction for impaired care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit of.08 contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count, namely that the central Crown witness provided exculpatory evidence, which the learned trial judge did not accept. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction was upheld. 1)The trial judge made express findings of credibility concerning the evidence of the two police officers who were notified of the appellant's symptoms of impairment prior to being informed of his right to counsel. The observations were not part of conscripted evidence which would place the administration of justice into disrepute in a Charter analysis. 2)Although the appellant was acquitted of his first charge of driving over.08, his second count of impaired driving was found to be unsafe because the observations were found to support the conclusion that the appellant had been drinking and that he smelled of alcohol. The third count was acquitted because the officer made no effort to observe the accused when he spoke to him. The officer's observations concerning slurred speech were found not to be relevant to the third count as the officer had not been informed of the rights to counsel when the tests were performed.  3)The appellant was in good standing to appeal on this ground. He argued that there was nothing in the record to indicate there was any inherent improbability in his evidence as it was circumstantial evidence, whereas the Crown's evidence concerning the impairment of the accused's speech and his ability to control the speech while he was detained constituted an unsafe verdict."
e_2011skqb444.txt,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and common assault. The Court found that the accused’s actions were done in self-defence. Given that the incident was captured on two security videos, it was not legally necessary to establish that the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the injuries caused to the victim fell within the definition of wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life. The accused had inflicted injuries to nine inmates in the course of the assault on the victim. The Crown had established that the existence of an actual assault was not a prerequisite for the defence under s. 34(2) of the Code."
e_2012skpc161.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","The accused pleaded guilty to aggravated assault thereby endangering the life of the victim contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that he report to his youth worker, contrary to ss. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The Crown applied under s. 42(9) for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence. The accused was sentenced to a secure custodial sentence of 24 months to be followed by a period of probation with credit for pre-sentence detention, 6 months of community supervision and 6 months community supervision. On the sentences imposed, the accused was ordered to provide a DNA sample to be included in the DNA database and on the sentences set out in s. 487.051 of the YCJA, the young person was prohibited from possessing firearms, having completed his Grade education and appearing before the Youth Justice Court whenever required to do so by the Youth Worker or the Youth Court Worker; he was to receive credit for 12 months. The court gave the accused credit for time spent in custody, which was to be served in closed custody. The defence did not oppose the application for a DNA order or weapons prohibition. The young person will be significantly and permanently disabled by the time he is sentenced. HELD: On the offences of breach of undertaking, including repeated blows with a weapon and the resulting serious harm done to the victim, the Court sentenced the accused to a sentence of 12 months, followed by 12 months probation.

e_2012skqb399.txt,"The defendant seeks a stay of the action pursuant to s. 8 of The Arbitration Act. The plaintiff is chartered accountant who was partner with the defendant. 2000 merger agreement signed by the plaintiff indicated that the Courts of Saskatchewan would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine all disputes between the parties. After the merger, the plaintiff signed new partnership agreement that said arbitration would apply to any disputes between partner and the partnership. HELD: The action was stayed pending arbitration. The plaintiff's statement of claim does not rely on the 2000 merger agreement, the claim is based solely on the new partnership agreement and alleges breaches of the partnership agreement. The partnership agreement clearly states that disputes are to be resolved through arbitration.","FIAT: The defendant seeks a stay of the action pursuant to s. 8 of The Arbitration Act, 1992. The plaintiff was a chartered accountant. He joined the partnership of MNP and became subject to the partnership agreement until June 1, 1999. In 1999, MNP gave notice to the plaintiff that his partnership arrangement would be terminated effective September 30, 2009. In May 2011, the plaintiff's solicitor sent a letter to the C.E.O., the parent company of the defendant, requesting his dispute with Meyers Norris Penny LLP to be referred to arbitration. In November 2011 the plaintiff commenced claim against MNP. Relevant portions of the claim are: 6. Effective September 1, 2000, Laidlaw was admitted as a principal partner of the MNP, subject to terms and conditions of the Partnership Agreement. The merger agreement provided the courts of Saskatchewan would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine all disputes and claims arising between the parties. The Partnership gave notice in May 2011 that his partner would be terminating his partnership and his entitlement to his capital account and buy-out. On May 10, 2011 the defendant sent another letter requesting his termination of the partnership. The defendant applied to stay the action pending the commencement of arbitration proceedings. HELD: The action is stayed pursuant to ss. 8(1), s. 6(1) and s. 24.1. The defendants applied pursuant to the Arbitration act on the question of relevance. They sought to have the stay stay entered into force on the basis that the agreement was in direct conflict with the choice of law in s. 2.11 of the merger agreement, which purports to give an arbitrator the authority to resolve disputes and interpret law according to the Province of Alberta. The issue must be decided by the courts, not the arbitrator. 1) Arbitration is not a question of law. The claim is solely based on the new partnership agreement, alleging breach thereof. No relief is sought under the new agreement. 2) The only other provisions in the Act that apply to this situation that may result in refusal to stay proceedings are s. 7 of the Act, s.8(1)(c. A‑24.1 of the Arbitrators Act and the Act of Queen's Bench.  3) The Court cannot interfere with the arbitration proceedings in any event with respect to the substance of the agreement or with the application of the motion. The Court shall stay the proceedings until further notice. 4) The arbitration agreement does not provide Saskatchewan and its courts exclusive jurisdiction"
e_2013skca1.txt,"The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The chambers judge dismissed the application and certified the action as a class action against all defendants. The proposed appellants sought an order pursuant to Rule 173(c) of The Queen's Bench Rules striking the within action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and non-client. Consequently, no common issue existed upon which a certified class action could reasonably be certified. The respondents also opposed the certification on the ground that it conflicted with the Ann's test and the tax opinions provided by the respondent were not to be given to prospective investors. They also argued that the Chambers judge erred in law in failing to apply the Anns test, which requires a review of the underlying documents and agreements. Dismissing the application with the exception of the tax opinion, which was not filed by the respondents, was prima facie destined to fail and not of sufficient merit to warrant the Court's attention. The Chambers judge did not apply the test in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan and were well known to counsel. The issues to be considered in this leave application are whether the proposed appeal is prima fide, destined to succeed, whether the Court should err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominates over other issues affecting individual members of a class. HELD: 1) The proposed appeal by the appellants was dismissed or withheld in consideration of merit and importance. The Court held that the respondents had not demonstrated a common interest within the meaning of the Act and that their affidavits filed as a result of the action were not evidence of a shared interest or common law interest.  2) The respondent pled not guilty to the charges brought against him and did not demonstrate a breach of fiduciary duty by filing the affidavits on behalf of the respondents. 3) While the respondents and the Chamber judge may have been alive to the practice, they should have taken appropriate steps to guard against opinion letters being inappropriately used for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with the client or clients.  4) The respondents did not file any affidavits demonstrating negligence on the part of the Respondent. They filed an affidavit arguing that the respondent and the plaintiff were not related. 5) The Court noted that the failure of the respondent to file affidavits supporting the respondent's affidavit was also a factor affecting his decision to file an affidavit in support of the motion. 6) There was no appeal"
e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent seeks to expunge child support arrears that have accumulated as a result of his not paying child support for many years. He is 72 years old and practising internal medicine and rheumatology in the United States. HELD: 1) The respondent has not paid child support in the amount of $186,746 since the separation. He has been paying this amount for the past 12 years. The petitioner is 63 years old, suffering from anxiety and depression and on long term disability. She is working as a nurse. 2) There is no reason to believe that the respondent has the ability to pay child support. He simply did not have the means to do so. The court calculated the arrear from the time the respondent first applied (in 1998) to the date he stopped paying (in 2001). The 2001 order was varied and therefore his child support obligations are still calculated on an income of $109,912. 3) The petitioner has always been a child of the marriage. The Court considered the factors set out in Wurmlinger and D.B.S. 441. 4) The father will have a few lean years until he has paid off the arreaars in about 3 years. It will be a bit of hardship. But not an undue hardship. The father should receive the full amount that, but for his dodging his obligations, would have been available to her when she was raising their children."

The accused’s conduct over the past 18 months satisfied the court on the balance of probabilities that hers was an exceptional case and that a curative discharge would not be contrary to the public interest. The court imposed numerous conditions on her, including that she could not have or consume alcohol and should report to a probation officer, receive addiction counselling, participate in AA meetings and provide proof of her attendance to her probation officer. Her driver’s license was cancelled and she was prohibited from driving for two years.","The accused entered guilty plea to one count of driving a motor vehicle while her blood alcohol content was over 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and asked to be granted a curative discharge pursuant to s. 255(5) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The Court found on a balance of probabilities that the accused was in need of treatment to deal with her alcohol consumption and addiction. A positive attitude, good attendance at AA meetings, a reasonable risk of relapse and continued contact with a professional addictions counsellor were all factors to be considered. The Court gave the accused three months to apply for the discharge on the basis that she had already met the curative conditions set out by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Ashberry in determining whether a case was'sufficiently exceptional' to merit discharge. The accused had demonstrated good behaviour in the three months prior to her discharge and was working with a significant alcohol intake."
e_2017skqb219.txt,"HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children. The grandmother seeks an order that she and the father have joint custody of the children but her home be the children's primary residence. HELD: 1) The father is entitled to supervised access to the children. He was not opposed to the grandmother having reasonable and liberal access with them. The issues are whether the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest with respect to these children, if so, what parenting arrangement the children should have, what child support should be payable by the father and how the grandmother can show a settled commitment to their children.  2) There is no evidence that the grandmother has a blood tie to either parties. It is clear from the photographs that her relationship with the children predates the grandmother. However, there are photos of the grandmother with her children in the summer of 2011. The father testified that he smoked marijuana and hashish, the mother's claim for custody and her request that the children be designated as beneficiaries of any life insurance, pension plan or health care plan he owned was supported by the grandparents. 3) There are no established circumstances in which the grandmother could have served an application for contempt by obtaining an order for substitutional service on the father. In such circumstances, s. generally should be applied to screen out applicants who do not have both a significant relationship and demonstrated and ongoing commitment to the child."
