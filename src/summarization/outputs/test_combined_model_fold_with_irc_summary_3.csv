The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly.

The result was an 'F' indicating that the accused had blood alcohol levels of at least 100 milligram. The accused was transported back to the detachment where she was turned over to a qualified technician. The charge was dismissed. The court found that in order for a certificate of analysis to constitute evidence as set out in s. 254(1) of the Criminal Code, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out either in the certificate or be proven by other evidence. HELD: The accused's evidence as to the use of the model did not sufficiently advance the Crown's case and there was no evidence of blood alcohol content.  1)The accused's case was not properly characterized by the model, which would have been sufficient to identify the instrument by weight of the certificate, but rather by the fact that the technician described the model to the Crown in R. v. Gilbert (1976), 31 C.C.C.(2d) 251 (Ont. C.A.). 2)The certificate may be used to prove facts, not law. The instrument or type of instrument used is matter of fact; whether such an instrument is an approved instrument is a matter of law. If it were otherwise, no reference at all to the name of the instrument would be required, and the proof would be made by stating simply that the said sample was received directly into an instrument approved for this purpose pursuant to s. 237(6) of Canada. 3)There was insufficient evidence to establish the accused’s level of impairment.

The document consists of preprinted form and is made up of pre-printed words and underlined blanks. There are five alterations of the preprinted material and one alteration of writing contained within one of the blanks on the document. Each of these changes consists of changing the expression of the year from 19 to 2003. Under the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case, Parliament has the power to deem things to have been proven regardless of whether the question is one of fact or of law. HELD: The accused's charge is dismissed. 1)It is not possible to know who made the striking out of the word and symbol 'Breathalyzer®' and the writing in of the 'Intoxilizer' and there is no symbol with it. While it is probably the same person made the alteration that is not initialled, one cannot adequately be sure that this was done. 2)The accused's argument that she did not adequately designate the model of the approved instrument was not supported by the evidence. 3)There was no evidence that the accused blew into any of the instruments designated for the purposes of identification, nor that there was any evidence that she was qualified to make this argument. There was no medical evidence as to the alcohol level at the time of the samples taken, no reference at all to the name of the instrument, and the proof would be made by stating simply that the said sample was received directly into an instrument approved for this purpose, section 237(6) of the Criminal Code. 4)The certificate may be used to prove facts, not law. The Court noted that R. v. Gilbert (1976), 31 C.C.C.(2d) 251 (Ont. C.A.) was specifically not followed in Saskatchewan. It was unnecessary and inappropriate for the Court to comment upon those issues.","[1] The accused is charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood.

Accordingly I must and do take the law to be that in order for a certificate of analysis under paragraph 258(1)(g) to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence. Under the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case, I find that the approved instrument is not adequately identified as to make and model by means of the certificate.

The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'. There was no symbol with it. In the blank that followed was written '5000C'. This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed.

The document consists of preprinted form and is made up of pre-printed words and underlined blanks. There are total of alterations in preprinted material and one alteration of writing contained within one of the blanks, resulting in a change in the expression of the year from 19 to 2003. The original printed phrase was 'That did receive each of the said samples directly into a Breathalyzer® model an approved instrument as defined in s254(1) of the Criminal Code' and the sectional diagram drawn through the lines and above same is a word that is not used in the certificate or by other evidence. HELD: The accused's charge was dismissed. The accused was found not guilty of driving with an alcohol level over the legal limit. 1)The certificate may be used to prove facts, not law. The instrument or type of instrument used is matter of fact; whether such an instrument is an approved object is a matter of law. While it is probably the same person made the alteration that was not initialled, one cannot adequately be sure of this. Probably not. The use of certificate is rarely, if ever, adequate to meet the burden borne by the Crown in a criminal trial. If it is to be afforded to the Crown the use of a certificate is shortcut afforded to it. 2)There was insufficient evidence to adequately identify the accused with respect to the model of the approved instrument. There was no medical evidence that the accused blew the instrument into any of the three models designated for identification. 3)The accused's model did not adequately advance the fact that the instrument was designated for this purpose. The case law does not apply here. There is insufficient evidence at all to properly identify the instrument when the model is not properly designated and the only way to do so is by way of the make and model. The model did adequately describe the instrument in all its unusual and unusual circumstances and was not sufficiently described in the case report to be adequately identified. 4)The Court could not rely upon the model's expert opinion or the weight of the evidence if it was not adequately identified and therefore there was no evidence","[1] The accused is charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood.

d_2009nssm48.txt,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This was an appeal by the landlord from an order of the Director which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy. It also denied the landlord's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the tenant effectively refused to renew for another year. The Landlord appealed. Allowing the appeal and declaring the tenancy had not been converted into a Month to Month, that the landlord had not withheld consent in a timely manner, for reasons beyond the control of either the landlord or the tenant, and that were neither arbitrary or unreasonable.","[2] This is an appeal by the Landlord from an order of the Director dated August 31, 2009. That order effectively permitted the Tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month one. About four months before the expiry of the second year, the Tenant gave a proper notice that he wished to convert the tenancy into a month to month tenancy, pursuant to the provisions of s.10A of the Residential Tenancies Act, which provides: [5] The Landlord responded within thirty days and refused to consent, giving his reasons why he believed that it was not in his interest to have a month to month tenancy. [7] The Residential Tenancies Officer stated in his reasons that based upon his reading of the Residential Tenancies Act, the Landlord “may not deny the tenant’s request that the lease be changed from a year to year lease to a month to month effective September 1, 2009.” In so failing to consider the Landlord’s reasons, I believe that the Residential Tenancy Officer erred in law.

5_2004skca60.txt,"The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of the Municipal Board Act. The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply abnormal obsolescence to the owner's property. The issues also relate to 15 other properties and as the issues are the same for each property they were decided by the Assessment Appeals Committee on one appeal. The Assessment Appeals Committee dismissed the appeals, finding the issue not to be a matter of the Assessor's Discretion but a matter of professional interpretation of data. The Committee found the Board of Revision did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err on the issue of abnormal obsolescence for size. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted on two questions of law.  1) Did the Committee err in its interpretation and application of the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual by failing to find that economic obsolescence for size must be categorized on a MAF by MAF basis? 2) Did the Committee err by failing to find the Assessor should have used the comparable unit method to determine whether an adjustment for obsolescence for size should be applied to the applicant's property? 3) On the use of invalid sales leave was denied on the basis the question of the sale is a question of fact and in argument the applicant said for its purposes the impugned sale did not matter. 4) Leave to appeal was denied on the issue of the standard of proof that there was no error demonstrated.","The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The issue is the use of invalid sales and the alleged improper onus or standard of proof. The issues relate to 15 properties. 15 properties were decided on one appeal and the issues were the same for each property. The test in such applications must be strictly applied when the applicant seeks to appeal an assessment. The door may still be opened but the key to opening it is a demonstrable case of concrete and material failure as it may relate to the general. The key certainly does not lie in speculative, abstract, or harmless failures of process related to the particular. The onus of establishing the ground is on the appellant.[4] Leave is granted to appeal on the basis of the sale and in argument the applicant said the impugned sale did not matter. Further on the record the Assessor was fully aware the sale was a portfolio sale, had contacted both the vendor and purchaser, and provided particulars of the sales verification form as part of the evidence to the Board. Leave is denied on the issue of standard of evidence and the issue has been decided by the Court. Leave to appealed is granted by reason of the two grounds listed above. 1) There is no evidence that the Committee made any error. The question of whether the Committee erred in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err. 2) The question must be one of law. It is the second prerequisite that causes the difficulty. The Committee made no error in failing to find that the application contravenes the Urban Municipality Act and the Manual by failing to consider the economic and political obsolescence for the purposes prescribed by the Manual. The method of analysis used in the assessment was not equivalent to the method used by the Committee in Shalk v. The City of Regina et al. (CanLII 4690). 3) Leave for appeal as to costs arising pursuant to the Court's decision to grant leave was denied.","LANE J.A.

In this context I conclude that the judge in guiding Mr. Wulkowicz did no more than was necessary to ensure that the trial proceeded fairly and efficiently. [39] Except for Ms. Murphy’s claim to access her personal belongings, I would dismiss her appeal. I would dismiss his appeal. [41] Aside from a direction that Ms. Murphy be given immediate access to her personal belongings, I would dismiss both the appeal and the cross-appeal in the circumstances without costs.",0.2953020134228188,0.516320474777448,The wife sought a more favourable division of assets and an entitlement to health insurance from the respondent husband. The parties owned three separate properties at the time of the separation. One of the properties was purchased with proceeds from the sale of the Chicago property but broke down en route and was abandoned because the cost of repairs would have exceeded the value of the vehicle. The respondent husband cross-appealed claiming that the property was given to him by his sister and he overstated the purchase price of the property. The trial judge found this to be a palpable and overriding error and dismissed the appeal and the cross application without costs. Both parties' affidavits were found to be true. The court found no palpable or overriding error in the standard of review as the evidence was readily available at trial and there would not be the same opportunity for direct and cross-examination related to the evidence which was available for the trial.,0.4912280701754385,c_2005nsca147.txt,"As part of the divorce, the Supreme Court ordered a division of assets. Both parties appealed the asset division; in the process, both parties sought to introduce fresh evidence. The wife also questioned the level of assistance offered by the trial judge to the husband who was self-represented at trial. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with the exception that the wife is to be given immediate access to her personal belongings; both applications to introduce fresh evidence dismissed; on the sparse record before him, the trial judge did not err in his division of assets and did not offer the husband unwarranted assistance as a self- represented litigant. Faced with two competing claims as to the amount of the proceeds of sale, if any, of one of the parties' properties, the trial judge committed no error in finding the amount owed to be half-way between the two claims and then setting it off against the amount owed to the other party."

c_2005nsca7.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant to provide banking, blending and lifting of coal at its coal preparation plant. The defendant was the successful bidder. The plaintiff sued for damages in the amount of $270,307.05 for negligent misstatement and breach of contract.

Allowing the appeal and dismissing the cross-appeal, that both parties had breached the contract, Roper by failing to perform and Devco by not providing the approximate tonnages set out therein. The trial judge found that even if the defendant had performed the contract the plaintiff would have continued to operate at loss. As a result, the judge held that the plaintiff did not suffer any loss as a result of the termination of the contracts. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The plaintiff was awarded fair and reasonable compensation. 2)The defendant was awarded nothing but the sum of $10,000 awarded to the plaintiff for the costs incurred by the defendant in obtaining the substituted performance contract and the refund of overpayments made to Roper for the no work performed contract. 3)There was no loss of profits arising as a consequence of the defendant's termination.","Held: Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed per reasons for judgment of Cromwell, J.A.; Oland and Hamilton, JJ.A. concurring.

The Court reviewed the history of the executors and found that they all swore in good faith and acted in accordance with the directions contained in the Will. 4) There is no evidence that either of the deceased's sons or daughters acted in a fashion inconsistent with their obligations to administer the estate in accordance to the directions in the will.  5) There are no special circumstances within the meaning of s. 16 of The Legal Profession Act, 1990, which directs that no person other than a member of the Law Society of Saskatchewan holding a current practice certificate may enter or carry on or defend an estate.

They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants.

The claim was issued November 1, 1999 and is based in debt for goods and services provided to the defendant. The value of the claim is $521,283.99 and refers to provision of materials, products and services in 1995 and 1996. The statement of defence was filed November 12, 1999 and amended in 2002. In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary.

5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right.

The accused argued that since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, with no risk of setting off a driving error, the court need not enter the analysis of whether the accused had de facto care or control of an inoperative motor vehicle. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. 1)The accused had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the person that was occupying the driver's seat was incapable of providing a sample of his breath and that he required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. 2)Although the accused may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand.

The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle pursuant to ss.255 and s253(b). 4)There was no evidence of impairment by reason of his physical condition which would justify a demand for a sample. The evidence established the accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion. 5)The Court held that it would be unfair to deprive the accused of his s. 10(b) right to counsel in any way. Given the circumstances of the accident and the accused's condition at the scene, it was not unreasonable to expect the accused to sleep in the vehicle at the time of the demand.  6)The court found that there was no reasonable person's question as to his ability to operate the vehicle with respect to his health and safety. The only question was whether he was able to fully exercise his rights or fully exercise them when he spoke to a lawyer","[1] The accused stands charged as follows:

The accused was sitting in the driver's seat with his seat belt on when the accident occurred and he did not ask to speak to a lawyer. At issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a blood sample demand and whether the accused was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: 1)Since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, with no risk of setting it in motion, the Court found that the accused had'reasonable and probable ground' to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample. All of the requirements of s. 254(3) have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The Court reviewed the principles it had established in R. v.

The evidence established that the officer had probable and probable reasons to believe the accused could not provide a breath sample either because of his condition and the smell of alcohol from the vehicle; 4)There was no evidence concerning the accused's position in relation to the medical condition of the accused and no suggestion that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right.

1) on or about the 23rd day of January, A.D. 2004 at or near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan did while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug have the care or control of a motor vehicle contrary to section 255(1) and section 253(a) of the Criminal Code. 2) on or about the 23rd day of January, A.D. 2004 at or near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan did having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood have care or control of a motor vehicle contrary to section 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a). The court hereby finds the accused was “in care or control” of the motor vehicle pursuant to the presumption in s. 258(1)(a). [29] Considering the case law, the submissions of counsel and after objectively considering all the indicia of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicated driving error), there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(3) to make a demand for samples of analysis. In the circumstances, the court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. [34] I find as a fact he, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused’s head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. [35] Considering the foregoing, I find Officer Kiesman had reasonable and probable grounds to believe (and in fact did believe) that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All of the requirements of s. 254(3) have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence discloses Officer Kiesman made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. The court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way. [37] Having found as above, there is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis, Exhibit P1 in these proceedings. [38] Accordingly, the court finds the accused guilty of count 2, being care or control with a blood alcohol content in excess of .08. [39] As to count 1, care or control while impaired, the evidence clearly does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt, as envisaged by the case law, including: The court finds the accused not guilty of count 1, being impaired care or control.",0.6160616061606161,0.5783132530120482,"The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving and one count of having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol content exceeded.08 contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused argued that since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, with no risk of setting off a driving error, the court need not enter the analysis of whether the accused had de facto care or control of an inoperative motor vehicle. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. 1)The accused had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the person that was occupying the driver's seat was incapable of providing a sample of his breath and that he required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. 2)Although the accused may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. The totality of the evidence would lead any reasonable person to that conclusion. The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused and, in coming to his conclusion, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the potential seriousness of the assault, the head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and the length of time it would take to treat the victim and keep him under observation. 3)All of the requirements of s. 254(3) had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle pursuant to ss.255 and s253(b). 4)There was no evidence of impairment by reason of his physical condition which would justify a demand for a sample. The evidence established the accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion. 5)The Court held that it would be unfair to deprive the accused of his s. 10(b) right to counsel in any way. Given the circumstances of the accident and the accused's condition at the scene, it was not unreasonable to expect the accused to sleep in the vehicle at the time of the demand.  6)The court found that there was no reasonable person's question as to his ability to operate the vehicle with respect to his health and safety. The only question was whether he was able to fully exercise his rights or fully exercise them when he spoke to a lawyer",0.6519148936170213,5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.

He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private.

1994canlii4796.txt,"The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security.

The taking of security interest by way of a loan agreement contravenes s. 146(2) and s.147(3) as the provisions of the personal property security act apply. 2)The applicant had not retired and there appeared to be no evidence of her having received a pension or any other benefit from the plan. The proposal to transfer the interest to a third party which did not include an attachable pension did not comply with s.7.03 of the Plan Contract. 3)Since the applicant was not a party to the plan contract, there was no monetary sum current for Crown Life to set off, unless a proper request for a transfer had been made by her. 4)The loan agreement had no provisions prohibiting the applicant from setting off her indebtedness to it against any monetary sum due from it. Since Ms. Corscadden has not retired the benefits from the pension will be payable immediately upon the commencement of her employment and therefore there appears no case of her receiving a pension from the Plan contract immediately upon her retirement age, the provision of a commutation and surrender clause in the plan did not apply. 5)No special dispensation or order respecting the transfer of the assets under the plan to any third party was granted in any event.  6)Each party was entitled to a share in the proceeds of the sale of any assets in the company pursuant to the terms of the plan Contract and the reasons in Chambersburg v. Lifshen. 7)Nothing in the plans contract or the Income tax Act prohibits the applicant's interest in the group plan from being assigned or attached by any means necessary to it. The provisions in s.57 of the PPSS do not exist. 8)The provision of the loan agreement which provides that upon an annuitant's coverage terminating, the respondent's account is to remain in place with the insurer until her termination, unless the benefits of a pension refund or a share of a retirement benefit are obtained or transferred to another depository in accordance with s","Ms. Corscadden seeks a declaration under s. 63 of

The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.'

A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income.

They invested in these partnerships in 1989 and 1996. In 1996, the Registrar in Bankruptcy granted an ex parte order directed against the petitioner, his wife, and their holding company, Ashton Holdings Ltd., requiring each of them to preserve and retain intact and in specie various market securities (the Securities) previously owned by the petitioner pursuant to an alleged security interest granted in her favour by the respondent.

4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","In October 2014, Turcotte J. ordered the defendant to pay retroactive child support to his former wife in the amount of $21,645 and costs of $1,500. The issues on appeal were whether the defendant had the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 Variation Order, whether the Court had the authority to order the payment of retroactive support both before and after that date, and by misapprehending the facts by failing to find unreasonable delay. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The court drew a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. The jurisprudence that questions the defendant is founded on case authority that predates such authorities as the Court of Queen's Bench. Given the wording of the 2006 Consent Child Support Order, which does not direct that an adjustment should be made as of a particular date, that issue does not arise in this appeal. 2) It is important not to confuse the two lines of authority. In Frey, it has become accepted that the Court in Frey held that there is no expressly legislated power to vary an interim order. The Court draws a clear difference between interim and final order. In Final Order, the Court held that a final order, issued by consent of the parties in accordance with their prior agreement, could not be varied. The defendant has not shown that he has not been advised of changes in circumstances. 3) The defendant failed to find any unreasonable delay in his application. The court was not asked to overrule the defendant.","Appeal dismissed [1] This is an appeal from the decision of Turcotte J. on October 16, 2014, ordering Daniel Prescesky to pay retroactive child support to his former wife, Mandy Lantz, in the amount of $21,645 and costs in the amount of $1,500 (Prescesky v Prescesky, 2014 SKQB 334 (CanLII), 456 Sask R 306 [Prescesky]). Analysis [28] Mr. Prescesky submits that Turcotte J. erred: (i) by varying the 2011 Variation Order, which he submits was a final order issued by consent of the parties in accordance with their prior agreement; (ii) by varying the 2011 Variation Order without first finding a material change in circumstances; (iii) by misapprehending the facts when he found Mr. Prescesky did not advise Ms. Lantz of changes to his circumstances; and (iv) by misapprehending the facts by failing to find unreasonable delay. (a) Did Turcotte J. have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 Variation Order? (b) Was it necessary to find a material change in circumstances before the 2011 Variation Order could be varied? A.

[35] Second, he argues that in the area of family support orders, the courts draw a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. Whether the Court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support is governed not by common law principles, but by the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, c 3 (2d Supp). [53] I will now turn to consider the nature of the orders in question and the authority that can be invoked to sustain their variation. [72] In short, I conclude that Turcotte J. did not err by concluding he had the authority to vary the 2011 Variation Order and to order Mr. Prescesky to pay arrears arsing before it and compelling him to pay the Guidelines amount for the period following it. B. Was it necessary to find a material change in circumstances before the 2011 Variation Order could be varied? By the terms of the 2011 Variation Order, the parties left to a future court the finalization of the amount of child support based on Mr. Prescesky’s income.  Faced with this state of affairs and these words, the Court of Queen’s Bench retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances.

In December 2011, the defendant abandoned his request to change the primary residence of his ex-wife to that of his current one. He applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for an order varying the 2006 Consent Child Support Order to include the change in custody of his two children. The Court found in December 2011 that the defendant had exceeded his means in paying the child support he was owed for the period from January 2009 to August 2012 inclusive. In May 2011, a variation order was issued which reduced the defendant’s monthly child support payment to $950 from $1,000 per month. The defendant filed an application for variation of the variation order in which he alleged that he had been required to pay $2,000 less per month in the previous variation order and that he should not have instructed his solicitor to consent to it.

6_2004skca37.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] We do not need to hear from counsel for the respondent. I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law.

The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","The two accused were charged on separate informations with assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and wilfully damaging the windows of a car. HELD: The accused were found guilty of both charges. 1) The physical altercation in this case was precipitated by jealousy or by a drug deal gone bad. There was no doubt that the accused were the aggressors throughout. He smashed in one, if not two, car windows. He chased after the complainant with Dagenais' help. Once at the trailer he rushed up the stairs toward the defendant. This was threatening behaviour and the defendant said he felt threatened. As the complainant said in his testimony, the defendant was not there to apologize. The accused both admitted to breaking the front passenger window and breaking the rear window. However, the Crown was unable to prove the cost of repairing the windows was under $5,000.

The Crown and the defence were allowed to call all of their evidence at the trial on one information, which would all be applied over to the other information. The court found that the first count was not guilty as the defendant choked the plaintiff at one point during the fight. The second count was found not guilty because there was no evidence that the parties were involved in any of the alleged physical or verbal fighting. The actions of the accused was aggressive. They both took necessary and lawful action to protect themselves and their family. This is not what either McIntyre or Graham used two by four to hit or kick in the window. The defendant said she did not know the plaintiff when she said that she felt threatened and that she put the plaintiff in a headlock in order to keep him around until the police arrived.  3) The photographs of the injured parties were filed. The doctor's examination revealed that the complainant had the following injuries: two centimetre laceration to his right eyebrow; two wounds on his chin; two centimeter diameter horizontal bruise and three centimetres post neck bruise on his scalp.  4) The injuries were not consistent with the actions taken by the two accused. The plaintiff was the main aggressor throughout and the actions of both accused were aggressive.  5) The defendant admitted to drinking alcohol in the evening.

3_2002skca56.txt,"A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services).

The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed.

8_2015skqb144.txt,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The petitioner was granted joint custody with the mother with primary residence with the father and access for the mother. The parties had separated in November 2012. The petitioner filed an Answer and Counter-Petition in January 2013 contesting the respondent's claims for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, the request for restraining order and costs. The respondent counter-petitioned claiming division of property under the Family Property Act, S 1997, C-8.2, joint custody of Z. and S. to be with the wife and child support for the father set aside for 6 months. The interim agreement provided that the parties would have Z. in the interim care of the mother and that the respondent would receive parenting time. The mother was to have her own home. The father was to pay child support and the parties had been locked out. HELD: 1)The mother was concerned that the father was holding her child from her and that she needed to end the relationship. She telephoned the respondent the next morning principally to try and get the child back to her house. 2)The father was in constant pain and the mother was afraid to get out of his house. 3)All communication went through their lawyers. 4)The parties had followed the interim agreement which provided that all materials would be provided to the petitioner. 5)The evidence from the parties’ lawyers was that although the father had not seen the child for some time, he was often verbally abusive, grabbing the petitioner and hugging her and saying things like “I’m sorry” and “Get out of here!” The petitioner’s counsel had accurately summarized the verbalizations in the statement of mind given by the father that the child would not be able to sleep with her for several days because of the restrictions placed on his access to the computer and the Internet. 6)The petitioner was awarded one-half of the day and one-third of the parenting time that was to be paid for by the respondent. 7)The respondent was ordered to pay $600 in child support, the cost of the settlement and the costs of the application. 8)The wife was to bring the child to her home in Warman and the respondent was to provide the other half of the household with necessities such as books, toys and books. 9)The child was to spend one day with his mother in her home. 10)The parents would have access on a shared week-on/week basis until trial could be held","I will now go through the factors set out in s. 8 of the Act. I find that despite what Mr. S. states, she was the primary parent of Z. since birth and continues to be so. Indeed I learned more (although not much) from his mother’s evidence as to the day-to-day activities. I am left with a degree of uncertainty. I accept that the child expresses these words. The child is in need of a stable, reassuring and positive home. I find that it is best provided in the mother’s home. I am concerned that Z.’s emotional needs have been adversely affected by the conduct of Mr. S. A lessening of Mr. S.’s time with Z. may ameliorate this. [145] Accordingly I am persuaded that Z. is afforded far more social fulfillment when in his mother’s care. I find that this adversely reflects upon Mr. S.’s ability to parent. [165] Therefore after carefully considering all of the above, I am of the view the following orders are in the child’s best interests, and I so order: (a) The petitioner, M.D.J., shall have sole custody of the child Z., born in June 2010, with his primary residence to be with the said petitioner. (b) The respondent, C.W.S., shall have alternate weekend access with the said child from Friday at 6:00 p.m. to Sunday at 6:00 p.m. to be extended to Monday at 6:00 p.m. in the event Monday is a school holiday. Therefore I accept the respondent’s argument and will add back into her income $5,000, which I consider to be fair. [170] I am satisfied that Z.’s s. 7 expenses for health, dental, activities and pre-school are about $5,061.35 per year (see P-28, tab 19 in P-8). I do not find the evidence supports an “extraordinary circumstance” as per s. 22(1)(a) of The Family Property Act (see Phillips v Phillips, 2010 SKCA 117 (CanLII), 362 Sask R 124). [186] Accordingly I accept that the exempt amount of the rental properties is $90,641.43 (i.e. $506,000 - $415,358.57). The result is that the respondent (petitioner by counter-petition) has failed to prove that he is entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act, and I dismiss his counter-petition in this regard. (1) Ms. J. shall have sole custody of Z., with Z.’s primary residence to be with Ms. J. and Mr. S. to receive parenting time as set out above; (4) Mr. S.’s claim for spousal support is dismissed; (5) Mr. S.’s claim under The Family Property Act is dismissed without any distribution to either party;",0.4169453734671126,0.5025432349949135,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home.

The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment.

Johnson Seeds entered contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting to secure product for resale. After extended negotiations the defendant eventually signed and mailed the standard form contract but never received an executed copy. The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993. The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price. HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action. 1)There was a valid contract between the parties. Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94. The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions. Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.  4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem. Johnson Seeds waited until the last possible day under the written contract terms to call the contract in an effort to position itself to claim increased damages for breach of contract.","The plaintiff claims damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. The plaintiff purchased specialty crops from producers and contracts with purchasers, including other traders or packagers, for the resale of the specialty crops. To secure the product for resale, the plaintiff entered into contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting of the same. The defendant attempts to have matching contracts for the quantum of specialty crops required with various producers with options for differing times of delivery to match the demand of the purchaser and to meet the delivery date requirements in the sales contracts. HELD: 1)The plaintiff received a copy of the executed agreement. 2)The contract was legally binding. 3)The parties communicated in person, by telephone, by fax and by mail. 4)The impurities and hulled seed count shall be established in accordance with procedure and standards used by the Canadian Grain Commission and included as foreign material. 5)The post office was legitimate agent of Johnson Seeds for the purpose of communicating the acceptance of the offer and confirmed that a contract did exist. The post office received the original signed contract in May 1993 and both parties considered that they had a binding and legally enforceable contract in November and in November 1993. The use of the word 'call' in the contract was not used. 6)Costs were awarded to the plaintiff for the costs of the sale of the canary seed.","The plaintiff, S.S. Johnson Seeds Ltd. (""Johnson
Seeds""), claims damages from the defendant, Barry Farr
(""Farr""), for an alleged breach of contract. Farr and Johnson Seeds both considered that they had
a binding and legally enforceable contract in May and in
November, 1993. While it may have
been in the reasonable contemplation of Farr that he would
receive back a fully executed copy of the contract, there is
no doubt that in the telephone conversations he had with
Calcutt in November and December, 1993, he verbally confirmed
that in his view a contract did exist. satisfied. Further, Farr had verbally confirmed on at least
two occasions that he did have a contract with Johnson Seeds
and at all times Calcutt confirmed that such a contract did
exist. For all these reason, I find that there was a valid
contract between Johnson Seeds and Farr. I find that Johnson Seeds knew in January 1994 that
Farr was in breach of the contract and this is when damages
should be assessed. Accordingly, Johnson Seeds shall have
judgment against Farr for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest

S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.

An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category.

There was no agreement or obligation to disclose the tax returns.

The petitioner was provided reasonable access. 4)Reasonable excuse for not seeking a variation was not sought. The annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum are not so significant that a petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 5)A material change in circumstance did not permit the court to pursue the same issues as the respondent. 6)The court was unable to find any reasonable excuse as to why the respondent failed to disclose her income tax return. 7)The respondent was not required to use tunnel vision when interpreting the evidence.","[1] The respondent applies to vary the child support orders of Mr. Justice Kraus dated September 10, 1999, and December 7, 1999, and/or the alleged agreement struck by the petitioner and respondent in or about July, 2003.

There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the respondent’s position was not blameworthy. To order retroactive support of $4,322.00, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner”s category.  1) There was no agreement or obligation to disclose the income tax return or notice of assessment annually. The respondent had been content to accept $380.00 as fair level of child support for both children. 2) The petitioner and respondent had agreed in 1999 that joint custody of the children would be increased by $50 per month. 3) In 2001 the respondent became unemployed and received employment insurance. The petitioner was provided reasonable access. 4) In 2003 the respondent and the petitioner agreed that the failure to disclose her tax return on June 30, 2004 and each June 30 thereafter constituted a breach of their alleged 2003 agreement. 5) In 2004 the respondent made an informal adjustment to monthly child support. The primary residence of both children changed to be with the respondent. 6) The respondent was content to pay $380 per month until July 2006. 7) In 2008 the respondent began paying $1,000 less per month as child support increased. 8) In 2009 the respondent paid $2,500 less child support than he had previously paid. 9) In 2010 the respondent stopped paying. 10) In 2012 the respondent started paying less. 11) In 2013 the petitioner paid less.

[3] The order of Kraus J. dated September 10, 1999 is hereby restored pending the determination of the issues by the Court of Queen’s Bench. 1) The respondent’s claim to retroactive support commencing July 1, 2004, a date the respondent advances rather than July, 2003. I cannot find any reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380.00 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July, 2003 until July, 2006. The respondent argues that the failure to disclose her tax returns on June 30, 2004 and each subsequent year constituted a breach of their alleged 2003 agreement.

An increase of these proportions would not lead me to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children’s support in a satisfactory manner. [30] When considering the circumstances of Meghan and Ryan over the same period of years, 2003 to 2005, no evidence was provided that their standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually.

To order retroactive support of $4,322.00, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would, in my opinion, represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner’s category.

e_2010skca79.txt,"The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. The appellant appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter was too severe. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons.  1) The issues identified by the appellant do not operate to make his convictions unreasonable. The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She underscored that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) When the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not in any way left with the impression that, if the photographs were of the appellant and not the driver of the white Tempo, this would have been the situation six years earlier. It was open to the jury to consider on a common sense basis whether it was likely that the appellant could have outrun the driver. 3) The appellant's argument that the trial judge left the jury with an erroneous sense of their significance was undercut by numerous considerations. The R.C.M.P. sergeant who was in the patrol car with the appellant testified that he had seen the appellant driving the Tempo and that, just because the appellant did not know the appellant, it somehow followed that the driver was not called to testify. The judge's comments about the appellant's mental health and the significance of the photographs did not sufficiently neutralize the speculative aspect of her original comments.","Disposition: Dismissed (Orally) [1] Following a jury trial, David Horkoff was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. [10] Mr. Horkoff grounds his argument on a number of concerns. They can be summarized as follows: (a) Constable Badger’s eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction, (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether, if it was Mr. Holoboff driving the Tempo, he could have outrun Constable Badger at the end of the car chase, (c) an adverse inference should have been drawn from the Crown’s failure to call the officer who was in the police car with Constable Badger, (d) the trial judge’s treatment of the photographs of Mr. Horkoff misled the jury about what had to be proven in order to establish that Mr. Horkoff was driving the Tempo, (e) the jury was improperly led to place particular reliance on an assessment of Mr. Holoboff’s credibility made by an R.C.M.P. officer who questioned him about possible involvement in the grow-op. However, the jury was alerted to them and we are unable to conclude that Mr. Horkoff’s convictions were unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole. It was open to the jury to consider, on a common sense basis, whether it was likely that Mr. Holoboff could have outrun Constable Badger. The trial judge’s caution about changes in physical condition over time adequately put that issue into a proper perspective. Assuming this is in fact a situation when an adverse inference could have been drawn, the trial judge was not obliged to instruct the jury that it must proceed to draw the inference. When the charge is considered as a whole, we do not believe the jury was in any way left with the impression that, if it concluded the photographs were of Mr. Horkoff, it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo. Further, the sentences imposed by the trial judge were not demonstrably unfit.

The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility.

He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. The appellant appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter were too severe. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons.  1) The issues identified by the appellant do not operate to make his convictions unreasonable. The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She underscored that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) In this case, the trial judge clearly indicated to the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the fact the police officer was not called to testify. She said it might appear extremely relevant that he was not brought forward to testify on the critical issue of identification. However, the jury was to consider on a common sense basis whether it was likely that the appellant could have outrun the driver of the white Tempo. It was also to be determined whether the appellant had been driving the vehicle at the time of the offence. The Court noted that R. v. Cook, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 1113, indicated that the broad discretion enjoyed by the Crown in the prosecution of offences, including the offence of trafficking, should be set aside. This case did not have the potential to be a'mug' case but rather was one that properly instructed a trier of fact, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered.","Disposition: Dismissed (Orally) [1] Following a jury trial, David Horkoff was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. [10] Mr. Horkoff grounds his argument on a number of concerns. They can be summarized as follows: (a) Constable Badger’s eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction, (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether, if it was Mr. Holoboff driving the Tempo, he could have outrun Constable Badger at the end of the car chase, (c) an adverse inference should have been drawn from the Crown’s failure to call the officer who was in the police car with Constable Badger, (d) the trial judge’s treatment of the photographs of Mr. Horkoff misled the jury about what had to be proven in order to establish that Mr. Horkoff was driving the Tempo, (e) the jury was improperly led to place particular reliance on an assessment of Mr. Holoboff’s credibility made by an R.C.M.P. officer who questioned him about possible involvement in the grow-op.

In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities. He plead guilty.

The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","The accused was presented with an indictment containing five counts. At the arraignment, the Crown stayed counts and granted a credit of two for one for the full remand time. The accused pled guilty to three counts. The sentences were imposed: COUNT 2 incarceration for 2 years and 3 months consecutive to the preceding sentences; COUNT 3 Incarceration of 1 year and 6 months, concurrent to the previous sentences; and COUNT 4 Incorporation for 1 year, 6 months and 2 years, respectively, for the time spent on remand. HELD: The global sentence was reduced to 4 years and 9 months from the total of 9 months served. The discretion to grant the credit remained with me despite s. 719(3) and (4) of the Criminal Code because the offences were committed and the charges brought before enactment of the section. 1) The gravity of the offences was very high because of a number of aggravating circumstances. The dollar value of goods and services realized and the total deprivation inflicted were both aggravating. 2) There clearly was pre-meditation and careful planning in advance. Several people were implicated in the criminal enterprise. The two schemes were pursued over a lengthy period of time and involved scores of transactions. There were many individuals and businesses subjected to embarrassment and anxiety. 3) The accused pleaded guilty. While it was long time in coming, it has avoided lengthy trial and the attendant expense. What is more important is that the accused had no income and would not have any for some time. 4) The credit should be one for one or put otherwise, the time actually served by the accused. 5) There was a further remand of 393 days in the years 2010 and 2011. However, that delay was largely the doing of the accused and that delay is largely the fault of the defence. 6) There were several other aggravating factors which must be emphasized and obtain a priority. 7) Denunciation and deterrence, both in the accused's and others' names, should be emphasized. 8) The Court must strive to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the objectives of sentencing. A fit global sentence would be eight years and six months. 9) The Crown must strive for rehabilitation. 10) There must be a high priority in the administration of justice.

HELD: The accused has been in custody on the subject charges for two years and eleven months. It was decided that a fit global sentence would be eight years and six months. In the result, the following sentences were imposed: COUNT 2 Incarceration for 2 years and 6 months, consecutive to the preceding sentences and a Payment surcharge waived as the accused had no income and would not have any for some time. 1) The conduct of the accused is most unusual, even bizarre, as it occurred while he was in prison. It extended over 18 months; involved many separate acts; and required participation by several individuals with the accused as the co-ordinator. 2) The accused pleaded guilty. While it was a long time in coming, it has avoided lengthy trial and the attendant expense. It has eliminated the necessity for many people to testify and go through the consequent discomfort. 3) The principles of sentencing remain and did have the assistance of the two cases cited above. Denunciation and deterrence, both accused and others, must be emphasized and obtain a priority.

The plaintiff sought production of documents related to a 2009 fire at another location rented by the defendant. The defendant resisted on the basis that the documents were not relevant. Held, motion dismissed. Under Rule 14.01, the motions judge must decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. The party seeking production must establish relevance. Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location.

b_2011skpc30.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care and control of a motor vehicle and care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.","The first issue before the court arises from the voir dire and concerns whether the Information to Obtain Blood samples contained sufficient grounds in support of the warrant. The Supreme Court of Canada has held that the warrant to search for blood samples issued pursuant to s. 8 of the Charter to be free from unreasonable search and seizure was invalid. The warrant was invalid and there was a breach of the accused's s.8 rights. The officer who swore the information to Obtains Blood samples was granted leave to cross-examine on the voiry dire. The Court reviewed the whole of the material presented and determined that the Certificate of Analyst and the report from the analyst were not sufficient grounds to admit into evidence. The Certificate of Analysis was not sufficient to warrant the admission of the blood samples but rather constituted a violation of the officer’s rights under s. 24(2) and s. 7 of the charter. The Lieutenant-Colonel was not required to provide sufficient detail to permit the justice to determine the appropriate statutory pre-conditions. The lieutenant-colonel knew all of the information when he applied for the warrant but failed to communicate it basic information to the Justice. The accused was not the only person at the scene of the accident who could have been presumed to be the driver of the vehicle. There were witnesses at the site of the crash and the Crown had advised the Justice that there had been a person fleeing from the vehicle when the officer testified. HELD: 1) The officer was granted fair and proper treatment by the court and the court found that the officer had grave concerns about the integrity of the police database, the reliability of the source of the evidence and the adequacy of the disclosure by the Justice of the Peace Boychuk in his analysis of the relevant information.  2) The information which the officer deposed in the Information To Obtain, when reviewed as a whole, did not constitute reasonable grounds for the belief that the accused had committed an offence under ss. 253 and 253. The Warrant to Search for Blood was invalid because the officer did not depose that he believed that the sole occupant of the motor vehicle, who was not wearing a seat belt, was in good condition to consent to the taking of samples of blood and that witnesses had not seen anyone flee from the overturned vehicle.  3) There was a relatively narrow basis for exclusion as the officer knew all the information and communicated all of it to the justice. The information must be considered in light of the factors set out in R. v. Laporte","[1] A trial took place before me regarding Curtis Russell Francis who is charged that on or about the 10th day of January A.D. 2009, at or near Regina, Saskatchewan, he did:

1. While his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drug operate a motor vehicle contrary to sections 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. I found that it did not and as a result there was a breach of the accused’s rights under s. 8 of the Charter to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. I then conducted an analysis pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter respecting the violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. I determined that the Certificate of Analyst and the report from the analyst dated April 20, 2010, should be admitted into evidence at trial. He did not depose that he believed that Mr. Francis was the driver of any motor vehicle, let alone the driver of the Tempo motor vehicle which was registered in his name and which crashed into a light standard around 1:19 a.m. on January 10, 2009. [35] I am of the view that the information which Constable Strueby deposed in the Information to Obtain, when reviewed as a whole, did not constitute reasonable grounds for the belief that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253. Accordingly, I hold that the Warrant to Search for Blood was invalid. [53] While I have found that the blood warrant was invalid and that the seizure of blood samples from Mr. Francis breached his s. 8 right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, I am of the view that Constable Strueby was nonetheless acting in good faith when he obtained blood samples from Mr. Francis. While I have found the Information to Obtain in support of the blood warrant deficient, I am confident that Constable Strueby honestly held the belief that Mr. Francis was drinking and driving and was acting in good faith throughout the early morning of January 10, 2009. [56] With respect to this avenue of inquiry, I am of the view that the breach of Mr. Francis’ s. 8 Charter right was done in good faith and did not seriously undermine the interests protected by the accused. [70] The issue at trial is whether the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused, Curtis Francis was the driver of the Tempo motor vehicle or alternatively was in care and control of the motor vehicle. [71] I am of the view that the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Curtis Francis was the driver of the Tempo vehicle which collided with the power pole on 6th Avenue at 1:19 a.m. on January 10, 2009. However, when their evidence is examined as a whole I am sure that Mr. Francis was driving his Tempo vehicle when it collided with the power pole.

The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant.

The information to be admitted was a technical error which was not fatal to the warrant.  3) There was no breach of the accused’s s.8 rights pursuant to the Charter. The officer did not omit crucial ground for his belief, namely that the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol. 4) There were witnesses at the scene of the accident who observed the accused lying face-down on the ground in front of the car. 5) The evidence heard on the voir dire was that the officer swore the information before the Justice of the Peace at 3:30 a.m. on January 10, 2009.

A review by the Minister would require new information and the appeal period had expired.

She was voluntarily released from the military and did not make an application for a pension. In October 1996, DND, without the plaintiff's involvement, re-assessed her release from the Military and ruled that she should have been released on medical grounds, being disabled and not being able to perform the duties of her trade or employment. The Crown brought an application to strike the statement of claim on the basis it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The plaintiff brought an action for damages against the government claiming that under s. 4(1) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act no action lies against the Crown where a pension is being paid or is 'payable' until the individual accepts the Minister's denial but believes for reasons unrelated to the pension application they are entitled to relief or remedy, and the Canada Pension Commission has granted the 'award' of pension in the applicant's favour'. The Crown argued that s. 111 of the Pension Act or s. 48 of the Liability & Proceedings Act could not be read having regard to the proposition that having been denied a pension by the government for sexual assault the plaintiff is now barred from bringing an action in the civil action claiming that she is now entitled to pension.

The limitation period for appealing the Ministers' decision had expired and the plaintiff was not in receipt of pension benefits. 1)Section 111 is a statutory defence and the Crown could not meet that onus because the plaintiff had never made an application. 2)The Crown did not meet the onus on the admitted facts that it could not bring the case within the ambit of the Act. 3)The doctrine that recourse to alternative bodies is bar to court actions has been considered by the courts in various contexts and is applicable to the present instance. 4)S. 111 is not a bar to the proceedings in the sense that the plaintiff did not pursue the administrative process in favor of civil action and the Court held that they had to pursue the same process. 5)In the present case the plaintiff has not exhausted the grievance procedure provided under the Pensions Act or the Queen's Regulations the remedies provided therein and the court would not have any jurisdiction as result of s. 18 of the Federal Courts Act.","The Crown, having denied her a pension cannot come forward now and say that she is barred in this action because she is now entitled to a pension when they have already decided otherwise.

The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim. The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674. HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. 2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. 4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.","The applicant sought an order by way of certiorari pursuant to Rule 664 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court, to quash the decision of the Workers' Compensation Board which denied the applicant's claim for compensation based upon its finding that the deceased spouse was not found dead within the meaning of s.30 of the Worker's Compensation Act. The applicant had become aware of the potential benefits in early July 2001 during a casual conversation at her workplace and suggested that her husband had been performing work duties while on campus to attend class or to study. The Board denied the application based upon two alternative grounds: the delay in bringing the claim, and the fact that the respondent was not 'found dead at work'. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The court considered the privative clause found in s.22 of the Act and concluded that the standard of review will generally be one of patent unreasonableness. 2)Section 45(1)(b) is not to be applied. Section 45 is to set out the circumstances in which the respondent died and the policies must not take the Board beyond the discretion afforded to them by the statute. 3)The respondent Board's decision to deny the application on the basis that the applicant failed to give notice was the correctness standard rather than the patent unreasonable one. 4)Section 7 of The Workers’ Compensation Act was amended in 1979 to provide for compensation to workers for injuries sustained in the course of their employment. 5)Section 8(1) was to be amended in 1981 to include the provision that allowed the Board to determine whether a deceased spouse’s death was a result of an injury. 6)Section 9(2) was not to bar the Board from making its decision based upon the circumstances set out in the legislation. 7)Section 11(3) is to be used where the board had complete discretion to make its decision. 8)Section 12(1), which provides for the equitable sharing of costs between the employer and the applicant, is to not bar the board from making their decision on a case by case basis. 9)In the case of the respondent Board, the decision to grant benefits to the applicant was based upon alternative grounds, which included the fact the respondent had not notified the Board of its decision in the first place. 10)Section 47 does not bar a person from compensation where the Board considers that the claim is just and should be allowed. 11)In this case, the reasons for the delay were the same as in the respondent board decision in November","[1] The applicant, by way of notice of motion seeks the following relief: a.

Whether the reasons for the delay such that it would be just to allow the claim to be allowed in spite of the delay, whether the Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption contained in s.40 within its jurisdiction, whether there was any uncertainty as to the cause of death based upon the circumstances leading up to the death, and whether the board","[1] The applicant, by way of notice of motion seeks the following relief: a.

He became ill while teaching a class. His students helped him to the faculty lounge. He was found in the faculty washroom unconscious and not breathing approximately 30 minutes later. Emergency medical technicians were not able to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead at the Royal University Hospital. An application for dependants' benefits was submitted over 3 years later. The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim. The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674. HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. 2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. 4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.","The applicant sought an order by way of certiorari pursuant to Rule 664 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court, to quash the decision of the Workers' Compensation Board which denied the applicant's claim for compensation based upon its finding that the deceased spouse was not found dead within the meaning of s.30 of the Worker's Compensation Act. The applicant had become aware of the potential benefits in early July 2001 during a casual conversation at her workplace and suggested that her husband had been performing work duties while on campus to attend class or to study. The Board denied the application based upon two alternative grounds: the delay in bringing the claim, and the fact that the respondent was not 'found dead at work'. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The justice of waiving the six-month limitation period involves an examination of the reasons for the delay and the substantive merits of the claim.  2)Section 45(1)(b) of the Act states that if there is no evidence to show the cause of death, it is presumed that the death was the result of an injury arising out of and in the course of the employment. 3)The standard of review is the'mere error' of law standard and not the 'patently unreasonable' standard. 4)Section 47 does not bar the board's decision from judicial review when the Board exercises its discretion to decide a matter but the legislation did not 'intend to commit the matter exclusively to the Board' in the case of the deceased. 5)The respondent Board must approach the application of Section 30 by firstly determining if the worker was found dead. The application for dependent benefits was submitted over 3 years after the death had occurred and on that basis alone, the claim for the claim could be denied. 6)The privative clause found in s.45 does not apply in the circumstances. If the evidence shows the death is not work-related, the policies must not take the Board beyond the discretion afforded to them by the statute.","[1] The applicant, by way of notice of motion seeks the following relief: a. An Order by way of certiorari, pursuant to Rule 664 of the Queen’s Bench Rules of Court, to quash the decision of the Workers’ Compensation Board dated November 20, 2002; b. An Order by way of mandamus, pursuant to Rule 674 of the Queen’s Bench Rules of Court, remitting the matter of the Applicants’ claim for benefits back to the Workers’ Compensation Board of Saskatchewan to be dealt with according to law; [13] Ultimately, an application for dependants’ benefits was submitted to the Saskatchewan Workers’ Compensation Board by a representative, Mr. Alex Taylor, on behalf of the applicant, on July 16, 2001. The applicant thereupon notified the Board on October 14, 2001 that she wished to appeal the September 18, 2001 denial of her claim, and on October 29, 2001, the Board issued a formal written decision, denying Gloria Truitt’s appeal because “Mr. Truitt was not found dead at his place of employment on March 2, 1998.” Based upon the foregoing application of Sections 45 and 47, or in the alternative Section 30, the appeal is denied. The appeal should be accepted. Accordingly, I am of the view that the Board did act outside its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the applicant’s deceased spouse was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of the Act. The majority decision in Henry v. Saskatchewan (Workers’ Compensation Board), supra, clearly precludes approaching an analysis of s. 30 as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. [36] For the fundamental reasons set forth in the above analysis, I am of the view that the Board did act outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in favour of the applicant. The appeal is denied. [46] I am of the view, for the foregoing reasons, that the Board has waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim. Here, the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. [53] The applicant has demonstrated an entitlement to an order by way of certiorari, pursuant to Rule 664 of the Queen’s Bench Rules of Court, quashing the decision of the Workers’ Compensation Board dated November 22, 2002, and further for an order by way of mandamus, pursuant to Rule 674 of the Queen’s Bench Rules of Court, remitting the matter of the applicant’s claim for benefits back to the Workers’ Compensation Board of Saskatchewan to be dealt with according to law, and so order. Further, there shall be an attendant order of mandamus compelling the Board to perform its statutory duty to apply the presumption set forth in s. 30 of The Workers’ Compensation Act, 1979, supra, in the applicant’s favour.

Canada). 3)The principles of the law and workers' compensation principles in general, particularly those relating to the use of the term 'found dead' in reference to the deceased, were reviewed by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in its decision on November 20, 2002. The privative clause did not apply in this case as s.45 did not bar it in the sense prescribed by the legislation. 4)S.45 is not a discretionary decision and, in the circumstances, should not be exercised in accordance with the boundaries imposed in the statute, the principles of administrative law, the fundamental values of Canadian society and the Charter. 5)The trial judge dismissed the application with respect to s.30.  6)Each application is a separate matter and should be dealt with according to the broad principles of law applicable to all circumstances. 7)The issues raised by this application are the same. Whether the reasons for the delay such that it would be just to allow the claim to be allowed in spite of the delay, whether the Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption contained in s.40 within its jurisdiction, whether there was any uncertainty as to the cause of death based upon the circumstances leading up to the death, and whether the board",0.4895104895104895,3_2003skqb257.txt,"An application for dependants' benefits was submitted over 3 years later.

They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause.

The parties were one year removed from the original decision and the matter would not get to pre-trial. There was no reason for the denial of the divorce at this stage. The child was now fully potty trained and would be able to participate in the program. The issues were resolved prior to the matter coming to chambers. The mere passage of time is not sufficient reason to vary an existing order. The statutory requirements pursuant to the Divorce Act for the granting of a divorce are present.

Arrangements to express breast milk while the child is being breastfed were made in order that the petitioner could be in contact with the baby while in his care. In addition, the petitioner was ordered to have additional parenting time with the two older children (ages 5 and 6). The petitioner sought to have the oldest child (now one year old) enrolled in a private program with an emphasis on social interaction and the development of the child. The second child (aged 1) was also included. The petitioner was granted custody and access on two of the three parenting issues.

They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","HELD: The Court granted the judgment and ordered the child to be registered in the Montessori program by the petitioner and begin attending as soon as the program was able to accommodate such attendance. The Court held that it would be in the children's best interests to have the matter proceed to a pre-trial conference as a stand-alone issue, even an expedited pre- trial conference. There was no reason for the denial of the divorce at this stage. The child had been in the petitioner’s care for several months and was doing well in the program. The issue of increasing parenting time was a new matter that arose during the course of an action and was not a variation of the existing order.","The parts of the various applications are as follows:

7. Objections to the petitioner’s affidavit of September 28, 2015 – brought by the respondent;
8. Objections to the petitioner’s affidavit of October 16, 2015 – brought by the respondent. [24] In the circumstances before me, I can see no reason for the denial of the divorce at this stage. Accordingly, the judgment for divorce is granted. 2. To register the child, Jude Babich, in a Montessori School – brought by the petitioner. On the basis of the evidence before me, it is therefore appropriate Jude now be enrolled in the Montessori program.

The parties were one year removed from the original decision and the matter would not get to pre-trial. There was no reason for the denial of the divorce at this stage. The child was now fully potty trained and would be able to participate in the program. The issues were resolved prior to the matter coming to chambers. The mere passage of time is not sufficient reason to vary an existing order. The statutory requirements pursuant to the Divorce Act for the granting of a divorce are present. The matter will therefore proceed to trial. The court has not dealt with the issue of the petitioner's participation in wrestling. This child is now 5 days old and the other children are still infants. The respondent indicated she would be the primary parent with the children. Arrangements to express breast milk while the child is being breastfed were made in order that the petitioner could be in contact with the baby while in his care. In addition, the petitioner was ordered to have additional parenting time with the two older children (ages 5 and 6). The petitioner sought to have the oldest child (now one year old) enrolled in a private program with an emphasis on social interaction and the development of the child. The second child (aged 1) was also included. The petitioner was granted custody and access on two of the three parenting issues. The third child (ages 1 and 5) was already enrolled in the private program.

Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them.

His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner.

7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with a number of offences, including robbery with a firearm. The police stopped the car and found the accused in it minutes after it was stopped in Fairview. The accused pleaded guilty to the robbery and the possession of the gun and brass knuckles. At trial, the accused testified that he had not been in Sackville at all and had nothing to do with any robbery. She said that the police had stopped to pick up people from the house where the robbery took place and the accused had been picked up just few minutes before. The defence argued that the accused's failure to identify him during the trial resulted in a reasonable doubt as to his involvement with the robbery. HELD: The court found that the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious. He was found in the car with a hand gun under the seat and with the stolen property, and he was in the back seat with the person he described as the'mastermind' to the gun. The circumstantial evidence did not support the conclusion that the Crown had committed a robbery beyond the range of a few months. It was reasonable to expect the Crown to have a reasonable chance of proving the first two men were the same people who robbed the accused. The court also found that although the accused admitted to doing the robbery, he was not the only person who was involved, the crime was more than foreseeable given the time period between the robbery report being called in to the take down by the police and the police. The Crown should have shown the court the car that was stopped on Northwest Arm Drive and the statement given by the defence counsel that it was the one that picked up the accused and the two young men that were in the vehicle after the police stopped it in high risk take down and that their identities would be determined based on the descriptions provided by the witnesses.","[1] On December 13, 2010 the police stopped a car driven by Candace MacDonald.

The victim was not asked to implicate the victim directly but said that he had been picked up in a building somewhere in Fairview and it would beg the question as to why he was doing that and what else he might be saying that was not true. HELD: The evidence of the victim’s involvement would have to be so strong that it would allow the inference to be made that the police officer was either mistaken or not telling the whole truth. The circumstantial evidence did not support the inference that the officer was just wrong. The evidence established that the person who was picked up by the police at the scene of the robbery was not the person they had picked up. There was no direct drive from the address in Sackville to the place on Northwest Arm Drive where the car was stopped. The police officer said nothing about stopping anywhere. The crime was committed in high risk take-down and the descriptions of the men who were in the vehicle matched the description given by the Crown witness.

The police stopped the car and found the accused in it minutes after it was stopped in Fairview. The accused pleaded guilty to the robbery and the possession of the gun and brass knuckles. At trial, the accused testified that he had not been in Sackville at all and had nothing to do with any robbery. She said that the police had stopped to pick up people from the house where the robbery took place and the accused had been picked up just few minutes before. The evidence at trial suggested that the accused’s failure to identify him might be a factor in his decision to rob the accused. HELD: The accused was found in the car with a gun and the stolen property and in the company of a person who had been recognized as the robbery victim. The court found that the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious. The fact that he was sitting on the bench with the gun in his hand and the person he was picked up with was not the only person who was familiar with the robbery. The circumstantial evidence did not support the idea that this was a case where the accused should have taken more time to identify and distinguish between the two groups. The admissibility of the accused and the absence of a description of the second and third assailants was not enough to satisfy the court. There was an opportunity for the Crown to prove that the third and the fourth assailants were the same people who robbed the victim.","[1] On December 13, 2010 the police stopped a car driven by Candace MacDonald. It was suspected of having been involved in a robbery with a firearm at a specific address in Sackville. Had he simply not been able to identify M.M. in the courtroom as one of those people, it could be said that with the passing of a few months that could be accounted for by fading memory. There is an inconsistency in the story that is so important that it raises a reasonable doubt. The Crown has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that M.M. was involved in the robbery, assault, confinement or threatening of Nykell Brooks. It has not proven that he was involved in the robbery and because of that there is no evidence that he knew or should have known that he was in a car with a gun or stolen property.",0.3695150115473442,0.570902394106814,"The victim of a car robbery was found in the car with the gun and stolen property, in the company of two young men who had pleaded guilty to the robbery and a gun and number of items reported to have been stolen in the robbery. The gun was found under the back seat of the car, loaded. The victim was not asked to implicate the victim directly but said that he had been picked up in a building somewhere in Fairview and it would beg the question as to why he was doing that and what else he might be saying that was not true. HELD: The evidence of the victim’s involvement would have to be so strong that it would allow the inference to be made that the police officer was either mistaken or not telling the whole truth. The circumstantial evidence did not support the inference that the officer was just wrong. The evidence established that the person who was picked up by the police at the scene of the robbery was not the person they had picked up. There was no direct drive from the address in Sackville to the place on Northwest Arm Drive where the car was stopped. The police officer said nothing about stopping anywhere. The crime was committed in high risk take-down and the descriptions of the men who were in the vehicle matched the description given by the Crown witness. It was logical to assume that the accused, who had not been in the courtroom when the police stopped the car and who had been there when it was stopped, was one of the people who picked up the stolen items.",0.5129151291512916,7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery.

He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The court upheld the sentence of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge for the offence of unlawfully trafficking in forest products.

F-19.1. [3] For its part, the Crown has appealed the sentence imposed taking the position that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence the evidence established.

He found that the Crown had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, the actus reus on Count No. 3 of unlawfully trafficking in forest products, but he held that given the defendant’s own words to the undercover operator, he was not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, the defendant was duly diligent to ensure that the wood he sold to the undercover operator and the previous sales (presumably referring to the previous 150 truckloads and the 58 truckloads he told Clarke he sold in 2008 and 2009) was wood coming from private lands. With all due respect to the learned trial judge, I find this conclusion and reasoning to be in error. The defendant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act as charged.

The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel had constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The dispute concerned the exclusive right to market, licence and distribute HAL's products in Canada. The parties entered into three separate contracts in 2008 that each provided that any disputes which could not be resolved by the parties would be settled by binding arbitration. The contracts each provided an implied condition that the parties could appeal an arbitrators' decision based on the very limited nature of potential appeals. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The language of the agreements was so clear with respect to the arbitration clauses and their finality that they cannot be overridden by vagueness or inadvertent omission. 2)The use of the word 'arbitration' in the meaning of s.45(2) of the Act does not fall into the category of the obvious or something that 'it goes without saying', in the factual matrix of this case. Such an implied term is not akin, for instance, to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation, or the term of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment, and if there is a contrary intention on the part of either party, it cannot be taken to have abrogated its right to appeal. 3)The agreements signed with HAL did not provide for the right of appeal on questions of law. The terms of the agreement set out very clear and well-defined procedures for dispute resolution, and the parties intentionally 'contracted out' of it.","[1] This is an application by Home Automated Living, Inc.

The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel was constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The parties entered into three separate contracts in 2008. The contracts each provided that any disputes which could not be resolved by the parties would be settled by binding arbitration. The respondent sought to have the exclusive right to market, licence and distribute HAL's products in Canada. The IDSL was the primary operating agreement and was automatically renewed for successive 3 year terms, unless either party cancelled the contract in writing at least 60 days prior to the renewal date. In this case, HAL took the position that the IDSL, as amended by the SCA and ESMA, did not impose an obligation on the respondent to purchase a set number of licences from HAL. Accordingly, HAL's claim was dismissed. HELD: The application was dispositive. Even if the conclusion in that respect had been different, the court would still not have granted leave. 1)A term permitting an appeal from an arbitrators' decision on an error of law simply does not fall into the category of the obvious or something that 'it goes without saying' in the factual matrix of this case. 2)HAL cannot appeal the arbitrators’ decision, and the application must be dismissed. If the right to appeal is not abrogated by the language of the agreements, then the court does not have licence to reconstruct the contract on equitable principles, or from the point of view of what the parties should reasonably have contemplated. 3)The use of the word 'final and binding' in this sense is not akin to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation, or the term of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment, but rather reflects the intention of the parties and the very limited nature of potential appeals. 4)The absence of reference to any other circumstances in which an appeal would be permitted was not inadvertent, but intentional. The degree of generality (precedential value) indicates that the parties turned their minds to the question of dispute resolution, which, except on that very narrow issue, intended to allow the arbitration panel to reach a final decision. There is simply no other reasonable interpretation of such wording.","[1] This is an application by Home Automated Living, Inc. [HAL], seeking leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel.

The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,"The accused was charged with offences contrary to s. 271(1) and s. 153 of the Criminal Code. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused touched her vagina, breasts and buttocks numerous times over top of her clothing. He also touched her inappropriately in the bedroom. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)There was reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The complainant's evidence was disbelieved. There was no credible evidence that he sexually assaulted or harassed the complainant. The circumstantial evidence was that he was drunk. He was not known to work outside the home. It was reasonable to expect that he would be guilty of some of the offences alleged. Although he did not have a criminal record, the evidence was not so reasonable that it would confirm his guilt. 2)The accused did not pose a danger to the public. The absence of any complaint by the complainant to her mother might be consistent with her fear that the accuse would leave and take the baby with him but the lack of complaint is also consistent with his innocence. 3)Although there was reasonable evidence surrounding his behaviour, it was not enough to convict him of his crimes. The Crown did not provide sufficient evidence to convict the accused of his most dangerous offences.","Although his explanations for touching and his evidence of the complainant’s behaviour are at odds with the Crown’s evidence, there is simply not enough confirmatory evidence surrounding the allegations for there to be proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused often slept on the couch in the basement of the house adjacent to the room where the family watched TV. There was a couch or love seat in the living room adjacent to where the children often stayed up at least until midnight. The accused frequently came up to the complainant and touched her legs, buttocks, breasts and vaginal area. She called the police. An expert witness testified that he had touched her buttocks only once and then fell on top of her. The complainant said that this was because he tripped over her younger sister who was lying on the floor. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. 1)The evidence tends to confirm the complainant's testimony. 2)The accused is not guilty of all of the offences. He is not a person who is prone to paranoid delusions or paranoid delusions. He has explanations for his behaviour. There is no doubt that he is a sexual predator. The only person who would have been more likely to believe him is the accused himself. The circumstantial evidence of paranoid delusions and paranoid delusions is not sufficient to confirm his allegations. He would be wrong to assume that all the evidence surrounding his behaviour and those of his ilk, including the sexual assault allegations, is circumstantially supported by the evidence of other sexual predators. It would not be appropriate for a Court to take judicial notice of his outrageous behaviour and the fact that he was drunk at the time he was charged. Although the accused is from Saskatchewan and raised in the province, his evidence is that he has always lived in a house that is near the residence of his estranged wife. The Court would be remiss not to take this evidence into account if it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that his behaviour was dangerous and unconscionatory, bordering on paranoid, and bordering on psychopathic, both of which would be supported by evidence of his psychopathic and sexual immorality. The Judge would not have taken this evidence seriously and would have done more to confirm and confirm the accused's allegations than any other expert witness in the area of sexual behaviour.","Although his explanations for touching and his evidence of the complainant’s behaviour are at odds with the Crown’s evidence, there is simply not enough confirmatory evidence surrounding the allegations for there to be proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

The grounds of appeal were that the learned trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count, namely, that the appellant had been drinking, that he had bloodshot red eyes, his mouth appeared to be dry, he was rubbing his lips and he smacked his lips even when he was not talking and that, having worked with the appellant in the past, he had not been informed of his right to counsel when the tests were performed; and that observations concerning slurred speech while the appellant was detained and prior to being permitted to drive constituted an unsafe and/or dangerous verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The learned judge made express findings of credibility concerning the evidence of the two police officers who testified at the scene as to the appellant's level of intoxication. The learned judge did not resort to conjecture or speculation as suggested by the appellant. 2)Although the results of roadside sobriety tests are not an admissible evidence at trial as evidence of impairment, there is no inherent improbability in the observations concerning the impairment of the accused. The observations were corroborative of other symptoms of impairment that were noted by the police officers. 3)The appellant could say with his limited exposure that the accused had alcohol on his breath, bloodshot eyes, flushed face, and his speech was lacking in any detail and he was as well smacking his lips. There was some support for her testimony in other evidence which was accepted by the trial judge.","[1] This is a summary conviction appeal from a judgment dated September 17, 2010, wherein the learned Provincial Court judge convicted the appellant of impaired care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, fined him $1,000.00 and prohibited him from driving for one year.

Conclusion [33] The appeal against the conviction is dismissed.",0.4337349397590361,0.5503875968992249,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato.

The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies.

There were no equities weighing significantly against the justice of the request.  2)The defendant had been a shareholder for many years. He led the company from 1985 to 1986. He was only a shareholder from October 1985 to July 1986. His rights as an existing shareholder were suspended by the consent order and not his rights as a former shareholder. 3)There was no temporal connection between the defendant's shareholding and the acts of oppression. 4)The judge did not apply wrong principle or make an unjust order.

Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies.

At issue was whether the defendant's need to defend according to counsel's assessment of the facts was a strong reason for concluding it would be unjust to hold the defendants to the admissions in the defence drawn by former counsel. HELD: The defendant was granted leave to appeal. The appeal was dismissed. 1)The defendant had not shown that he was acomplainant under s. 7(5)(b) of the Third Schedule or s.5(1), because he misinterpreted the effect of the April 2004 consent order, referred to in the statements of claim, which alleged that Oickle surreptitiously competed against the company during his employment, appropriated opportunities that would have been available to the company, and misused company resources to support his competition. 2)There were no equities weighing significantly against the justice of the request. There were no errors or omissions by the defendant on the first ground. The second ground was that the judge erred by making his decision in the absence of evidence indicating that it was just to withdraw the admissions. 3)The judge did not apply wrong principle or make an unjust order. The words of the consent order approved in Abacus were that 'a judicial admission should be allowed to be withdrawn if, in the circumstances, the court is satisfied it is in the interest of justice to withdraw same.' 4)The court found no error in applying the less restrictive test used in the Abacus case and dismissed the appeal. 5)Rule 21.02(4) permits the withdrawal of admissions at any time.

The Agency had not had an opportunity to assess the appropriateness of a placement with the biological father.","The agency applied for an order of permanent care and custody with no provision for access to the child. The mother opposed the application and requested an order returning the child to her care. The biological father who had minimal contact with the child was added as a party to the order. The Agency alleged that the child had been placed in the care of the psychological father because of instability in the home, the risk of physical harm caused by the mother and psychological father's failure to supervise the child, and that there was a risk of the child suffering harm as a result of the abuse. The psychological father was considered parent or guardian pursuant to s. 36(1)(b) and 3(1) of s. 45 for the purposes of protection finding. Testimony was received from the mother, child protection worker, the biological father, the mother's sister and a psychologist. HELD: 1) The burden of proof in proceeding such as this is clearly on the Agency. It is a civil burden that must have regard to the seriousness of the consequences of the decision. 2) The child was apprehended in April 2004 because of unsafe and unhealthy living conditions. The apartment was in disarray and the mother was living alone. The parties did not cooperate in addressing the risk factors that affected the child's health and safety. 3) There was insufficient evidence to determine the extent to which the respondent's actions were in breach of the provisions of the Act. It was unnecessary to ask the court to return the child who had been removed from her care and who had not been apprehended by the Agency prior to that date. 4) Counsel for the Agency was not able to represent the respondent. The respondent's attendance at a risk management conference meeting was limited to two people. 5) The respondent was not prepared to participate in any counselling sessions. 6) Counseling was not available to the parties. 7) The court was unable to decide whether or not to order the respondent to pay child support or to provide counselling. 8) Counsel must consult with the parties on issues of custody and access. 9) Counsel is not responsible for decisions that affect the children's well-being. 10) There is no evidence that the respondent will be able to protect the child from harm if returned to its care. 11) Counsel cannot advise the Agency on the best way to proceed with custody decisions. 12) Counsel will not be permitted to advise the respondent on any of the above.","[1] The Children\'s Aid Society of Cape Breton-Victoria (agency) applied for an order of Permanent Care and Custody, with no provision for access, with respect to the child, S.N.D., born [in 2003]. However, the mother has a history of frequent changes of residences and this period of stability only has been a few months. [53] Although the mother loves her child and wants to care for her she does not seem to be able to put her child\'s needs ahead of her own needs. Therefore, the Court finds that an Order for access is not appropriate with respect to the mother and psychological father.

The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the plaintiff. At issue was whether the Chambers judge erred in determining that the action against Chrysler had no reasonable chance of success and whether the Gold Key Lease has none of the characteristics of a rental agreement as contemplated by s. 62 of the Motor Vehicle Act. The Chambers judge did not err in determining the lease agreement did not fall within the type of rental agreement contemplated by Motor Vehicle 62. The reverse onus provision did not apply. The appellants had filed an affidavit arguing that the lease was actually a rental contract pursuant to s.62 of the Act and that the responding plaintiff failed to show that he was an owner pursuant to that provision. The affidavit also argued that Chrysler was not acting as a servant or agent of the owner of the vehicle at the time of the accident. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The court found that s. 248 has no application on the facts of this case.  1)The Chambers judge correctly cited the test in Bazley (see Bazley). The test is whether the law of vicarious liability extends to leasing companies, whether the lease falls into the 'lease with right of purchase' exception to the definition of owner. 2)There was no material facts in dispute. The material facts were not in dispute and the record as to what occurred prior to and in the presence of the panel was evident from the transcript of the hearings and the answers to interrogatories. 3)The lease agreement fell into the category of'rental contract' under the Act as it did not have strict liability in its own right and did not comply with any of the conditions set out in the Act. There were no issues of credibility and no need to weigh the evidence with respect to the version of events. 4)The appeal turned on the interpretation of two provisions of the act, s. 2(ak) and s.2(ak), which speak directly to the situation. The lease contains the characteristics noted in sec. 2 (ak). It cannot realistically be depicted as a rental Contract as defined in s 62. 5)The only issue on appeal was whether Chrysler had a real chance to succeed on appeal on the undisputed facts.  6)Costs to the plaintiff were awarded to the insurer. 7)The court was satisfied that the issue was unambiguously determined by the precedents.","Summary: The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, granting summary judgment to Chrysler on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of Giffin.

McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious.

McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","HELD: The application was dismissed.

The proposed appellants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 for an order granting them leave to appeal from the chambers judge's certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173(c) application. The appellants argued that the Chambers judge erred in law in failing to apply the Anns test, or in law by conflating foreseeability with proximity. They also argued that case law stating a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the evidence of the Respondent's lawyer did not establish a common issue within the meaning of s. 6(1)(c) of the Class Actions Act. Dismissing the application with leave, that the proposed appeal is prima facie destined to fail and not of sufficient merit to warrant the attention of this Court. It is not plain and obvious that the representative plaintiff had no cause of action against the lawyer. Furthermore, evidence of clients involved in the mining industry using legal opinions provided by the lawyer as a marketing tool is so commonly known among tax lawyers that McMillan should have been alive to the practice and should have taken appropriate steps to guard against their opinion letters being inappropriately used for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with the client or clients. The Chambers judge made no errors in this regard.","Disposition: Applications Dismissed They also opposed the certification of the within action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and non-client.

C-42.1 and Rule 49 of The Court of Appeal Rules for an order granting them leave to appeal from the Chambers judge's certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173(c) application. [14] With respect to the first question, I am satisfied the Chambers judge correctly held the action against McMillan was not devoid of merit or vexatious.

In the instance action, class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan’s negligence. These facts, coupled with case law stating a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the evidence of Mr. Davies, establish a common issue which appears to meet the requirements of The Class Actions Act. In my view, the Chambers judge made no error in his interpretation of the applicable law or the evidence before him, or in his application of the law to the relevant facts before him, which would warrant leave being granted based on arguments advanced by McMillan.

McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","The proposed appellants, McMillan LLP and Michael Friedman (collectively 'McMillan'), are two of the defendants in the within action commenced by the proposed respondent, Melvin Schneider (the representative plaintiff). In his statement of claim, the representative plaintiff pled that he and others suffered financial losses due to negligence by the defendant. The Chambers judge dismissed the s. 173(c) application and certified the action as a class action against all defendants. The respondents then applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 and Rule 49 of the Supreme Court of appeal Rules for an order granting them leave to appeal from the chambers judge's certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173(C) application. They raised the following grounds in their proposed notice of appeal: 1) the Chambers judge erred in law in failing to properly apply the Ann's test or by failing to consider policy reasons that may prevent the imposition of duty of care applicable to the individuals; 2) the tax opinions provided by the lawyer were essentially aspects of their defence and not reasons to strike the negligence claim at this juncture; and 3) the judge cannot be said to have erred by not taking these factors into account when dealing with the Rule173(c).","Disposition: Applications Dismissed They also opposed the certification of the within action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and non-client.

[14] With respect to the first question, I am satisfied the Chambers judge correctly held the action against McMillan was not devoid of merit or vexatious. Based thereon, he concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including circumstances akin to those before him. In his opinion, evidence of clients involved in the mining industry using legal opinions provided by their legal counsel as a marketing tool is so commonly known among tax lawyers that McMillan should have been alive to the practice and should have taken appropriate steps to guard against their opinion letters being inappropriately used for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with the client or clients.

In the instance action, class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan’s negligence. These facts, coupled with case law stating a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the evidence of Mr. Davies, establish a common issue which appears to meet the requirements of The Class Actions Act. In my view, the Chambers judge made no error in his interpretation of the applicable law or the evidence before him, or in his application of the law to the relevant facts before him, which would warrant leave being granted based on arguments advanced by McMillan.

The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors.

In addition, he is to pay 66% of the pediatric and spousal expenses.  2) In September 2005, Justice R. S. Smith terminated Mr. Alm's obligation for support effective October 1, 2005. He found that Corry had not paid support for Corry in the past 3 years. In September 2004, Justice Wilkinson of this Court granted a consent order extending the respondent s.7 expenses for the 2005/06 university year. The costs relating to the computer and the crisis prevention class were legitimate s7 costs. It was uncontroverted that the petitioner has disabilities which necessitate certain tools such as a computer and internet access for both girls. The Zellers supplies, however, would normally be covered under the Table support. Accordingly, that expense shall be disallowed. 3) The petitioner's s.8 education expenses for 2005/2006 are $7,123.72 calculated using the university fall and spring terms and 3,002.94 as their s.6 expenses. The University of Regina books and books (fall and spring term) are $609 per month. The student loans were covered by Table support but computer repairs and equipment were not specified. It is for that purpose that the matter comes before the Court.","The sole issue now before this Court is the amount to be fixed for the ongoing s. 7 expenses. Accordingly, there shall be an order that Mr. Alm immediately pay to Ms. Aaston his 66% share, being $74.18 of Kristin’s dental expenses incurred prior to October 1, 2005. There shall also be an order that Mr. Alm pay his proportionate share, being 66% of the costs of Brina’s orthodontic work. I also find that the crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on Brina’s part and will assist her in her future plans. Accordingly, that expense shall be disallowed. 9) I find Brina’s s. 7 post-secondary education expenses for the 2005/2006 year to be $7,123.72 calculated as follows:

In addition, the petitioner requested that the s.8 expenses be adjusted for the 2007 university year and that the respondent immediately pay his 66% share of the girls’ dental and orthodontic expenses.  2) The petitioner also applies for an order to be paid for ongoing s7 expenses. The sole issue is the amount to be fixed. FIAT: It was noted in the affidavit that Corry had indicated that he would have good idea of the 2006 university year by September 2006 but that the costs relating to the computer were legitimate s7 costs and the crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense.

c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused was charged with possession of an unloaded prohibited firearm pursuant to s. 95(1) of the Criminal Code and possession of a loaded prohibited weapon pursuant to ss. 8 and 9. The Crown had provided notice of its intention to seek this amendment at the start of Kyle's trial. The accused had not been on the arrest list at the time of his arrest. HELD: The accused was found not guilty.  1) The accused's Charter application in relation to the cell phone did not associate him with it and entitles him at trial to demand that the Crown prove the phone is his. 2) The essential issue on the firearms possession charges is whether the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of the loaded Mark II rifle, the loaded Cooey sawed-off shotgun, and ammunition in a careless manner. The intercepts are also of pivotal importance to the firearms trafficking charges. 3) The Court was unable to accept that the accused can assert a privacy interest in order to obtain the protection of s. 8 of the Charter and then, when that application goes badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. 4) There was nothing to the continuity/integrity of the exhibits. The evidence led by the Crown had established that the phone with the number 229-4400 was the accused's cell phone. 5) The evidence introduced as evidence in this trial was not the ones located in the accused’s and Torina Lewis’ home. 6) The statements of the accused and the documentary exhibits entered through or referred to by them left the court with no doubt about the continuity and integrity of the exhibit.","Also as a result of the Part VI authorized intercepts, on April 29, 2009, Kyle Cater was charged with trafficking firearms. They are: the unlawful storage of a sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, a Lakefield Mark II rifle, and an AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun, and ammunition, in a careless manner (contrary to Criminal Code section 86(1) x 3), unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, the Lakefield Mark II rifle and the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun (contrary to Criminal Code section 88(1) x 3), unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited weapon – the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun, and unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited firearm – the sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun (contrary to Criminal Code section 95(1) x 2), unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey and the AP 9 handgun, knowing that possession is unauthorized (contrary to Criminal Code section 92(1) x 2), and unlawful possession of two over capacity magazines, a prohibited device (contrary to Criminal Code section 92(2)). [9] On February 24 at the close of the Crown’s case against Kyle, I granted an amendment to Count #8 of the January 15, 2009 Information to allege, pursuant to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code, unlawful possession by Kyle Cater of an unloaded prohibited firearm - the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun together with readily accessible ammunition that was capable of being discharged in the firearm. [43] I am unable to accept that Kyle Cater can assert a privacy interest in order to obtain the protection of section 8 of the Charter and then, when that application goes badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. [101] I have concluded that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts is that the speakers are talking about guns. He obviously also tried to exercise a measure of control, telling his father to get rid of what was there, to no avail. [168] The “Tracey” calls on December 7 and the January 15 calls indicate that Kyle had much more than merely a passive or quiescent knowledge of the firearms and ammunition at 80 Cavendish. [171] There are a number of indicators of Kyle Cater having a measure of control over the firearms at 80 Cavendish. Accordingly I find him guilty of Counts 4, 5 and 6 of the Information sworn January 15, 2009, unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey shotgun, the Mark II Lakefield rifle, and the AA Arms AP 9 handgun, contrary to section 88(1) of the Criminal Code. I also find him guilty of Count 7, unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited firearm, a sawed off Cooey shotgun, contrary to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code, and of the amended Count 8, unlawful possession of an unloaded prohibited firearm, the AA Arms AP 9 handgun together with readily accessible ammunition capable of being discharged in the firearm, contrary to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code. [179] I further find Kyle Cater guilty of Counts 9 and 10 of unlawfully possessing the Cooey and the AP 9 knowing their possession was unauthorized, contrary to section 92(1) of the Criminal Code. And I find him guilty of Count 11, unlawfully possessing a prohibited device, two over-capacity magazines, contrary to section 92(2) of the Criminal Code. I am acquitting him of those charges. However I am not able to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Kyle had stored the three firearms in the manner they were found on January 15. I infer this from Intercept 7, a conversation on December 2, 2008 with D.M. and from the evidence that establishes Kyle was stashing his guns at locations other than where he was living. I find that the purpose of Kyle’s possession was offering to transfer it, that is, his purpose conforms to the Criminal Code definition of “transfer.” It was a firearms trafficking purpose. [207] My conclusions on the firearms trafficking charges can be summarized as follows: I find the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Kyle Cater is guilty of Counts 3 and 4, relating to the .410 gauge shotgun; Counts 5 and 6, relating to the Derringer; Counts 7 and 8, relating to the .308 calibre rifle; and guilty of possession of the .45 calibre handgun for the purpose of offering to transfer it. [208] I acquit Kyle Cater of Counts 9, 10, 11 and 12 on the firearms trafficking Information. I find Kyle to be guilty of the possession of the .45 calibre firearm on December 28, 2008, a finding I am making in relation to Count 1 of the Information, not as specifically charged under Count 9 of the Information as I find that on or about December 7, 2008, Kyle Cater did not have possession of the .45 calibre handgun he was discussing at that time with I.E.",0.382716049382716,0.5112781954887218,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed.

The police found two guns, a sawed off shotgun, a Lakefield Mark II rifle and ammunition, in a careless manner. The intercepts were also of significant importance to the firearms trafficking charges. The accused was charged with possession of firearms and ammunition contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Criminal Code. At issue was whether the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of the firearms. HELD: 1)The accused was presumed to be innocent until the Crown proved he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The evidence collected from the accused was that the sawed-off shotgun and ammunition were found in a box in the master bedroom of their home.  3)Evidence collected through various case management conferences and the assistance of the Canada Firearms Centre had not been dispensed with.  4)Although evidence collected at the scene of the search had been considered at trial, it was not accepted that the accused could assert a privacy interest in order to obtain protection of s.8 of the Charter and then, when that application went badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. 5)There was nothing to suggest that the guns and ammunition introduced as evidence in this trial were not the ones that were located in the other two individuals’ home. The evidence collected through the course of the trial was that of a witness. The witness’ testimony did not meet the burden of proof and there was no suggestion of a continuity problem.  6)Evidence obtained through the destruction of the evidence and the exchange of photographs between the parties was not considered relevant to the charges. 7)Statutes of the Custody and Interpretation of the Evidence and the Access to Information Act were not to be relied upon. The Crown and the accused were jointly responsible for the search of the premises. 8)The Crown had not established that the contents of the three guns seized were a prohibited device within s. 84(1) of the Code and a section of Part II of the Regulations. 9)Countries were not required to accept the evidence of the persons who possessed the firearms at the time of their arrest. 10)Counts were not issued pursuant to the Part VI authorization.  11)The essential issue on the firearms seized from the victims was whether Kyle had constructive possession of them.  12)","Also as a result of the Part VI authorized intercepts, on April 29, 2009, Kyle Cater was charged with trafficking firearms.

The petitioner was entitled to spousal support from the date that she put the respondent on notice of her application for spousal support. The respondent, at age 61, should not be forced to work overtime in order to meet his spousal support obligations. The Court found there was economic disparity between the income of the petitioner and the income of the respondent and awarded an interim award of non-compensatory spousal support in the amount of $400 per month, retroactive to November 1, 2013, until further order of the Court.","FIAT: Following the provisions of the Divorce Act for awards of spousal support, the court considers the economic disparity between the respondent and petitioner's incomes that is $79,320.00 versus $56,103.00 for the respondent. Given the respondent's income and the fact that he earns rental income after payment of property taxes, his net rental income yields $8,000 to the petitioner. The respondent is in receipt of CPP benefits of $6,540.00 per annum. HELD: 1)The court does not require the respondent to work more than a 40 hour work week by attributing to him an income which is based upon significant overtime income. At the respondent’s age and given his state of health, this Court will not compel the respondent by attributting his income to him more than 40 hours of workweek. At 61 years old, the petitioner did not seek any form of corollary relief pursuant to the provisions OF the Divorces Act nor did she claim for spousals. Nor did she seek spousAL support under the Family Maintenance Act, 1997. 2)The petitioner did file a within application in which she sought interim spielal support of $700.00.  3)The respondent indicated that he intended to work a standard 40 hour week at the rate of $28.50 per hour. This represents an annual income of $59,280. The petitioner also earned rental income from leasing farm land. Given that the respondent is now receiving $5,500 per year from CPP, his CPP benefit is increased to $7,540 per year. 4)The Court found that the petitioner’ s gross income in the year 2013 to December 14, 2013 was $95,275.73. This latter sum included $28,553.68 of overtime income and $28000 of income derived from oil lease revenue. 5)It did not require that the applicant take effective notice that she was seeking retroactive support.  6)It was not necessary for the petitioner to take effective leave from the date of the separation to file this application. The court gave effective notice to the respondent in October 2013 and granted it.","[11] For the foregoing reasons, and in accordance with the quoted case law, this Court will not grant retroactive spousal support prior to the respondent being put on effective notice that the petitioner was now seeking spousal support. At the respondent’s age and given his state of health, this Court will not compel the respondent to work more than a 40 hour work week by attributing to him an income which is based upon significant overtime. Referencing the SSAG, as a guide only, the court orders the respondent to pay to the petitioner interim spousal support in the sum of $700.00 per month commencing effective November 1, 2013, and on the first day of each and every month thereafter until further order of the court.",0.3892339544513457,0.4374999999999999,"FIAT: Following the provisions of the Divorce Act for awards of spousal support, the court considers the economic disparity between the respondent and petitioner's incomes that is $79,320.00 versus $56,103.00 for the respondent.

If the respondent takes notice that the petitioner is seeking support in the amount of $700.00 per month leading up to the date of separation, the Court does not compel the respondent to work more than a 40 hour work week by attributing to him an income which is based upon significant overtime income. At the respondent’s age and given his state of health, this court will not compel him to work any more than 40 hours of 40 hour days. HELD: The respondent was granted costs fixed at $1,200.

2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The charges relate to events which occurred between April 8 and April 14, 2010 respectively. The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases. The first proposed basis is to separate for trial all of the so-called status offences but not the others. There is no such risk of propensity reasoning in a judge alone mode of trial and the court will not countenance otherwise. The second application for severance is dismissed on both the bases proposed. It is indicative that the accused's decision whether to testify would be in the interests of justice. The only possible link conceded is the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the gun on both days. The other is that the evidence admissible on one count will influence the verdict on an unrelated count. The Crown has given shape to the broad criteria established in s. 591(3) and have identified factors that can be weighed when deciding whether to sever or not. The weighing exercise ensures that a reasonable balance is struck between the risk of prejudice to the accused and the public interest in a single trial. In this case of 21 counts, the court has had the benefit of watching a videotaped interview of the accused conducted by the police in the early morning hours of April 15, 2010. In that interview, the accused adamantly disclaimed any association with the subject handgun whatsoever. He maintains that the gun was not his and that he had nothing to do with its possession or use either on April 8 or on April 14. Defence counsel argues that this disclaimer is indicative of a person's intention to testify on both matters but not in respect of the status offences. At the same time, it is argued that it would be unjust for the accused to be placed in the position of wanting to testify with respect to the April 8th counts and thereby be exposed to cross-examination on the April 14th charges. The court must engage in a weighing exercise of all the relevant factors in deciding whether or not severance (see Last at paras. 16-18). It is important to remember that just because multiple offences are committed close in time, or just because offences involve behaviour that could be admissible in proof of some issue at the trial of another offence, does not necessarily set aside the need for a severance application.","[1] The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order.

The interests of justice encompass the accused’s right to be tried on the evidence admissible against him, as well as society's interest in seeing justice is done in reasonably efficient and cost-effective manner.

The videotaped statement to police was common piece of evidence to both events. On an application to sever a multi-count indictment, the overarching criteria are the interests and justice of justice. It is important to note that Litchfield, where the Crown was prevented from arguing the case properly because of an unjudicial severance order, does not necessarily be a better ground of departure for the accused because of the multiplicity of offences and the fact that the interests, especially in the context of justice, require a trial on one or more of the counts.","[1] The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order.

There is conflicting affidavit evidence respecting the nature and extent of the father's parenting duties while the parties lived together. The mother, Lesly, has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child with her. The issues of parenting and mobility are clearly unresolved and may go to trial. HELD: The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The primary parent status quo is Lesly. The child has a strong bond with her father and his family. However, there is no compelling reason to allow mobility in the case merely because the mother has made some unilateral decisions about her education. The evidence indicates that Lesly has made similar choices which have resulted in greater expense to insure that the child sees both parents. However it is fair that Mike contribute something to this cost. Costs in the cause are in the amount of $150 for the trip from Regina to Victoria. There was conflicting affidavits as to the extent of Lesly's involvement with the child but the affidavits indicate that she was involved in feeding, teaching and dressing the child and shared other parental duties with the father. The father would like the child to remain in Saskatchewan and have regular contact with each parent alternating each week. Lesly will advise the child if she will travel to Victoria for parenting time with her or if she chooses to parent in Victoria. The issue of mobility is to be determined by reference to Gordon v. Goertz (1996), 141 Sask. R. 241; 134 D.L.R. (4th) 321, which are well known and which are germane to the case. It is also relevant that a trial respecting the status quo will be held in Regina and the child shall reside there pending trial. In this case, the primary status quo, which is Regina, shall reside in Victoria and the applicant shall have telephone access until trial. The applicant shall pay the respondent for the cost of transporting the child (the petitioner shall pay Lesly by 9:30 a.m. of the 28th day of the trial) and the petitioner shall provide to the other telephone numbers where the child may be reached and shall make the applicant available for such telephone access.

The younger child was prone to extreme temper tantrums. The older child was more prone to violence. Support for the younger child had been given to her in the form of a letter to the effect that the older child would no longer be in the custody of the Agency if the protection order were lifted. The letter also stated that the Agency would not terminate its involvement with the child C.B., who had been living with her mother in a small residence and had threatened to run away if forced to do so.  7)It was clear that the oldest child had significant concerns about his protection history and that his relationship with his common-law partner (L.M.) had not been fully resolved at the time of the initial disposition review.

e_2005skpc8.txt,"The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged that he committed a sexual assault on the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1) The complainant was employed as clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and although she testified that she knew the accused in 1999, it was much more likely that she met him in the spring of 2002 after he assumed his duties as Justice of the Peace in the same building. The Court found that the accused had not been detained and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been infringed. 2) The accused's version of the incident in the general office differed significantly from that of the complainant. The accused responded to an invitation from the police to attend at the police station. He said he believed that the matter was closed and that he would return his call. She was required to specifically describe a number of incidents that took place over a period of about year and then year after the last of the incidents had taken place and believed her recollection was accurate. She believed that he was only joking and that there was never any indication that she wasn't consenting to it. The statement could be used in cross-examination for the purpose of attacking the credibility of the witness. It was necessary that certain findings of credibility be made in this case.  3) While there is some consistency as to the incidents that occurred prior to August 21, the same cannot be said about the events of August 2003.","[1] Mr. Toupin is charged that, on or about the 21st day of August, A.D. 2003, at or near[…], Saskatchewan, he did commit a sexual assault on T.D. contrary to section 271 of the Criminal Code. Issues [42] a. Whether the Crown has proven the actus reus of the offence, and
b. Whether the Crown has proven the mens rea of the offence. Analysis [61] I am satisfied that touching did occur in courtroom #10 and that the accused compelled T.D. to touch him and there can be no doubt that the touching had a sexual nature. Touching of a sexual nature took place and the complainant did not consent to the contact. [63] I have had no difficulty concluding that most of the employees in the building were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments that were of a sexual nature. After looking at all of the evidence, I cannot see anything in the evidence to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that T.D. consented to the sexual contact in question. Therefore the accused’s suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because I cannot cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her .

He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic.

At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.","The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their two children. The father and his wife, both medical professionals, claimed that the mother of the boys, his ex-wife and child and family counsellor, had wrongfully accused them of physically and sexually abusing them. HELD: 1)The mother's justification plea was withdrawn.  2)The evidence showed that the statements were made with express malice which can be proven by extrinsic or intrinsic evidence. 3)The Court dismissed the application for variation. It held that the facts brought into conflict different fundamental societal interests: society's interest in the protection of children from abuse, society's Interest in preventing a trial in which 'no party wins all parties lose', and the common interest of the people who make such communications. 4)The co-defendants, who had libel and were negligent in the preparation of the reports, were found to be in the best interests of the children.","The issues to be decided are:

1.Did the co-defendants libel the plaintiffs by publishing
each of the four reports thus causing damage to their
reputation?


2.Did the co-defendants conspire together to libel the
plaintiffs and wrest custody from the father?


3.Was the co-defendant counsellor incompetent and unqualified
to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the
preparation of the reports? Defamatory At the outset, K.T.\'s counsel conceded that, on
their face, the allegations of sexual and physical abuse and
alcoholism in Reports #2, #3 and #4 were defamatory. The whole long history of K.T.\'s attempts in and
out of court to discredit R.G.H. and W.G.H. so that K.T. could
have the children live with her and restrict access to R.G.H.,
is extrinsic evidence of ""impure motive"" or, in other words,
""malice"". K.T.\'s excuse (which I do not accept) was that she taped in
order to keep track of the number of telephone calls she made
to her children. I think it was just another trick to try and
advance her cause. Insofar as the first two of Helene C.\'s Reports were
tendered in Unified Family Court variation hearings, and the
other two were prepared in contemplation of using them in
future hearings, Helene C. For the reasons given in my discussion of the libel
action against K.T., I find that Reports #2, #3 and #4 were,
on the whole, slanderous. The negligence claim against Helene C. and
Helene C. Counselling Inc. is dismissed. I do not think there is need for further deterrence
now. CONCLUSION Judgments for the plaintiffs against all defendants,
jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000.00. Judgment for the plaintiffs against the defendant
K.T. in the amount of $1,000.00. Judgment for the

HELD: The Court dismissed the application for variation. The Court held that the information communicated must be reasonably appropriate in the context of the circumstances existing on the occasion when that information was given. The purpose behind the legal action was to bankrupt the wife so that she would be unable to oppose an application by the father to change the joint custodial arrangement. In the best interest of the children, the trial should never have taken place. The allegations of physical and sexual abuse were found to be entirely without basis in fact. The evidence did not support the allegations of abuse by the mother.

If the mother wished to pursue retroactive matters she may do so when and if this matter proceeds further to pre-trial. 7) In the matter before the Court, the Court found that s. 7(1)(d) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines was directed to give priority to child support in determining child and child support applications.

HELD: 1) The father is not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance. However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400.","FIAT: The Court ordered a number of orders regarding child support as well as an order regarding summer access. The remaining issues were: what, if any, should the father pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children?

Although it was clear from the evidence that the mother had an entitlement to interim spousal support, the father did not have the ability to pay.

The cost of the Childview program, with childcare costs of $7,800 per year, Sylvan learning centre costs at $1,261, income for the father at $37,900 and the mother at $13,085, the mother was required to bring this motion to obtain an appropriate sharing of s. expenses. The father was ordered to pay costs in the sum of $400 forthwith. 3)The preschool costs and the Learning Centre costs were included in the total cost. 4)The cost of child care was reduced to $472 per month. 5)The Education expenses were reasonable and within the means of the Federal Child Support Guidelines s.15.3(1) of the Divorce Act to give priority to child support in determining child support applications. Although the father was voluntarily providing support to the Mother, at least since February 2007, she was required by the petitioner to bring the motion in order to obtain the appropriate s.expenses. 6)The Court ordered the father to pay his proportionate share of both childcare costs and fees in addition to his s. child support payment, until Sylvan fees were paid in full. 7)The father was to pay retroactive support for the time period from February 2006 to February 2007. 8)The mother's claim for retroactive child support was made pursuant to s.7(1)(d).

7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in these proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life Insurance claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the insurer whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be decided. HELD: 1) While interpleader relief is appropriate, the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction is not immediately apparent. At this stage the competing claims to surplus are on the one hand Ag Credit and on the other hand Creditor's Group. The argument that any monies received by Ag Credit are 'public money' within the meaning of the Financial Administration Act and the Act and thus Crown property for the present purposes is non-sequitur. 2) While it is in the interests of all parties that the funds actually remain in the hands of Empire Life with the potential of continuing to earn interest rather than be placed on deposit with the Court, the economic realities of the litigation necessarily need to be recognized. 3) While there has been some disagreement as to the appropriate manner of addressing the surplus, it appears that Empire Life has acted in full compliance with its duty of uberrima fides in bringing the potentially valid claims of the insured clients to the attention of the Court and in resisting the claim to the surplus by the insurer, Ag Credit, that the surplus has always been and remains the property of the Crown. 4) The principles of the Saskatchewan Insurance Act, s. 254(1) of the Creditors' Guidelines governing group insurance provided that: all real or personal property and all money acquired, administered, possessed or received by the corporation is, for all purposes, including taxation of whatever nature and description, deemed to be within the confines of that Act. 5) The phrase public money is not found within Ag Credit's Act. The insurer may apply ex parte to the court for an order for payment of money into court or make appropriate orders as directed by the Court; and 6) The insurer would be entitled to receive, on pro rata, any life insurance premiums that were written off as these premiums were paid.","[4] In its application Ag Credit takes the positions that:
a. The funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses are the property of the Crown and properly payable to it as the Crown’s agent;
b.

Conclusion [37] The decisions I have made herein can be summarized as follows:
a. I dismiss Ag Credit’s application for an order that the surplus funds be paid to it on the grounds I have categorized as peremptory basis claims;
b. Empire Life is entitled to some form of interpleader relief in respect of the surplus funds;
c. A representative will be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings to determine whom as between Ag Credit and those clients is entitled to the surplus in question;

His sentence was suspended with a 1-year probation order. During argument on behalf of the appellant, it was suggested that the trial judge make three errors of law leading to the conviction.

4_2009skca102.txt,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","The Crown appealed a sentence of 26 months in pre-trial custody and 2 years probation imposed following the death of their 7-month-old daughter. The mother had been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and her previous criminal record included convictions for possession of a weapon and mischief. She had refused post-natal health services, and had avoided contact with child welfare agencies for three months prior to the offence. At the sentencing hearing, the Crown and defence agreed the appropriate range of sentencing for manslaughter was four to 12 years. The issues were framed by the arguments and cases submitted by the parties. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis of the first two grounds: 1) that the sentencing judge did not give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability and 2) that there were mitigating factors including the mother's dysfunctional upbringing, her mental disorder which resulted from that background, and her social and economic situation. These factors led to the conclusion that post-traumatic stress disorder was a mitigating factor and that the sentence imposed would not be appropriate given the range of sentences imposed for offences of this nature. The sentencing judge also failed to take into account the factors the mother had previously been convicted of, namely, having been sexually assaulted and domestic abuse.

The sentencing judge awarded her 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis of three grounds: 1) the sentencing judge failed to give proper weight to both the gravity of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability in it; 2) the trial judge erred by failing to give appropriate weight to the aggravating features of the case and by overemphasizing the significance of the factors he found to be mitigating; and 3) the respondent had a dysfunctional upbringing which may have caused symptoms of PTSD. The Court found these factors to be aggravating factors but the respondent failed to take them into account in assessing her potential sentence. The issues were not in dispute. The respondent had been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and her previous criminal record included convictions for possession of a weapon and mischief as well as two convictions for not abiding by the conditions in her probation order. The parties agreed upon the range of sentences for manslaughter and the only cases referred to the court were Hathway, supra, and Schoenthal. The judge did not embark on an analysis of the kind set out in Laberge but that authority does not require judge to explicitly enunciate every factor considered in coming to his conclusion. The court found the respondent was found to have compelling personal circumstances that led her to commit the offence, namely, the trauma suffered as a result of the child's death, which included multiple fractures and blunt force trauma to the head, feet and head, which led to his unconsciousness and ultimately his death. These were mitigating factors but not sufficient to warrant a higher sentence.","Disposition: Allowed On February 11, 2009, the sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of two years less one day to be followed by two years probation.

The mother had been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and her previous criminal record included convictions for possession of a weapon and mischief (which resulted in the birth of the child's fourth child), and for failing to call for help in a timely manner. The defence argued the sentencing judge erred by failing to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability in it. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis of this latter ground. The essential facts were not in dispute. The respondent was only looking after the child for a couple of hours when she was injured and she did not seek immediate help when it was apparent the child was injured. The sentencing judge did not embark on an analysis of the kind set out in Laberge but that authority does not require a judge to explicitly enunciate every factor considered in coming to his conclusion. Both offenders had troubled histories and mental health problems. Both initially denied responsibility, hid evidence and blamed the injuries on another child, as well as her abusive background and her social and economic situation. There were prior acts of physical abuse and neglect by the respondent and these factors led to the conclusion that post-traumatic stress disorder was a mitigating factor. These factors were considered and given appropriate weight by the sentencing court.","Disposition: Allowed On February 11, 2009, the sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of two years less one day to be followed by two years probation.

She had refused post-natal health services, and had avoided contact with child welfare agencies for three months prior to the offence. At the sentencing hearing, the Crown and defence agreed the appropriate range of sentencing for manslaughter was four to 12 years. The issues were framed by the arguments and cases submitted by the parties. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis of the first two grounds: 1) that the sentencing judge did not give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability and 2) that there were mitigating factors including the mother's dysfunctional upbringing, her mental disorder which resulted from that background, and her social and economic situation. These factors led to the conclusion that post-traumatic stress disorder was a mitigating factor and that the sentence imposed would not be appropriate given the range of sentences imposed for offences of this nature.

3_1995canlii4402.txt,"The respondent expropriated a parcel of land owned by the appellant. Prior to a hearing, all claims for the case were settled for the sum of $20,000. The appellant's solicitor presented solicitor and client accounts of $19,420 plus taxes. The respondent directed taxation, and the appellant's solicitor submitted further accounts for services and disbursements of the taxation hearing amounting to $7,212.24. The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000.

The land was approximately 10 feet of the 30-foot rear yard for retaining wall. The construction of the retaining wall began in February 1994 with the work beginning in June 1994. At the end of the work, the appellant advised the City that it intended to abandon the land retaining only an easement necessary for the footing. City council approved the abandonment in October 1994. The solicitor for the appellant rendered a solicitor-client account to the City in the amount of $19,420 plus taxes representing approximately 100 hours time spent on the file and in a decision dated August 25, 1995 he reduced the account to $14,000 plus taxes. The Taxing Master was correct in declining to award the sum of $5,855 to the appellant. The appellant's appeal was dismissed and the taxation of costs by the taxing master confirmed.  1)The appellant had no liability for any costs associated with the solicitor and client taxation and the fact that the matter was settled did not result in a denial of costs. 2)Taxing officers are not to be interfered with on appeal unless and until it is shown that they fell into error by the exercise of some wrong principle. 3)A judge's fundamental consideration in statutory interpretation is the role of the solicitor. Consideration must be given to both the spirit and letter of the legislation. In this case, the appellants suggest that the City disallowed any services that were actually incurred, but as a result of design changes, was located entirely within the original street width, leaving only the footings protruding into the claimant's property. 4)In a previous case the appellant had made an offer for full compensation for the unpaid legal services rendered by the appellant in regard to the disposal of the respondent's (expropriation) property. 5)The respondent's accountant was taxed by the city for $20,000 and the solicitor's account was taxed at $7,000. 6)It is common practice for almost all commercial accounts to have some reference to interest on overdue balances stated on invoices. The mere statement of an interest term on an invoice by itself raises no legal obligation for payment of such costs.

2009skqb506.txt,"The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession. The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","The landlord appealed a decision of the hearing officer of the Residential Tenancies Office. The hearing officer found that she did not have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter and the landlord appealed. Appeal dismissed; the notice of vacate served on the tenant was set aside. Although one of two joint owners can serve notice to vacate, the section that the Landlord relies upon is only available to periodic Tenancies and Mr. Koch is the sole owner of the property. Even if there wasn’t a lease, the landlord and tenant signed a 3-year lease. The tenant argued that the Hearing Officer erred in law by failing to make an order for possession of the rental unit. The landlord appealed; certain circumstances where a landlord’s right of tenancy to a tenant had lapsed, such as breach of trusts, could be found in favour of the landlord. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The Act applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to the tenant. 2)The tenants had entered a written tenancy agreement. The Hearing Officer did not err in law in finding that neither the landlord nor tenant had joint authority to enter the agreement.  3)The tenancy agreement was valid. There was no breach of trust by the landlord as the tenant did not purport to act for his mother or for his benefit. 4)The hearing officer made no error in law.  5)Section 70 of The residential Tenancies Act provides for an order respecting any tenancy agreement, rental units and other residential property. Section 8 of the Act applies. Section 7 provides for possession by lease and for written tenancy agreements. Sections 8 and 9 provide for the determination of periodic tenancies. 6)Section 8 provides for a hearing officer to inquire into the tenants’ rights. 7)Section 7 of the Code of Conduct provides for disclosure to persons who wish to obtain possession of a rental unit pursuant to s.2(f)(i) or pursuant to section 33(g) of the tenancy agreement unless otherwise noted. 8)Section 9 of the LEA (Lease of Ownership) Act provides that a person who signs a tenancy agreement must be estopped from denying the fact of the third person's agency under the general law of estoppel, and it is immaterial whether that person was acting for himself or for the landlord in finding she had no jurisdiction. 9)The Hearing Officer adopted the common law definition of landlord and adopted the formula of landlord","[1] Sheila Buch appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of Residential Tenancies, dated August 27, 2009.

The hearing officer found that she did not have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter and the tenant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the notice to vacate was served on the tenant. The tenant had signed a 3-year lease in good faith and believed that the landlord, Koch, had made an error in law in allowing her to move into his home. Koch denied any wrongdoing and argued that the Hearing Officer erred in law by failing to make an order for vacation in favour of the tenant and the landlord. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The tenancy agreement between the landlord and tenant was one of contract and did not create any interest in land owned by the tenant for the purposes of estoppel or otherwise. 2)The hearing officer did not err in deciding that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. To create a fixed term tenancy of three months or longer, the tenant must enter a written tenancy agreement. Section 20 of the Act provides for a hearing officer to determine whether a tenant has the right to possess a rental unit pursuant to s.2(f)(i) and s.7(f) of the rental unit. Section 21 of the Trade Union Act states that a landlord is an owner's agent or another person who, on behalf of the owner, grants to another person the exclusive right of tenancy to rental unit for insurance purposes. 3)The Hearing Officer made no errors in law. The Act applies to tenancy agreements, rental units and other residential property. 4)Section 7 of the Charter gives rise to the term tenancy by virtue of the fact that it contains the standard conditions (e.g. the date and place of hearing, the address for service and the telephone number of the landlord or the landlord's agent) and the terms of an order respecting the right of a tenant to pay rent. 5)Section 8 of the Code provides for an order of possession if a dispute arises between a landlord and a tenant and if the tenant has a tenancy agreement with respect to certain specified rights or privileges. 6)Section 9 of the Common Law applies to written tenancy agreements. One of the factors cited in this case was the fact the Hearing officer had no jurisdiction to hear the matter. The Hearing Officer adopted the same words and phrases used in the following cases: 'tenancy agreement'; 'owner's agent'; 'lord' means landlord; tenant; landlord; agent.

The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened.

It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract.

It was clear from the outset that the appellant was motivated to acquire the land for his own purposes and not just to help out the plaintiff by taking it off her hands and thus relieving her of the burden of owning it. It is understandable that at the time of the agreement neither therese Nadeau nor the solicitor gave much consideration to the value of the residence and yardsite.

With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1) The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum. The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'.

The petitioner seeks to set aside the settlement agreement on the grounds of undue influence and duress or alternatively that the agreement was unfair and unconscionable.

It was not feasible to apply Miglin's analysis as there was no basis for it to be applied in the circumstances. 2)The petitioner was entitled to support under the agreement and the circumstances as they presently exist. The respondent was to pay $65 per month in child support. The amount payable shall be reduced in an amount equal to 40% of the petitioner's income that she has earned.  3)This was not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim support. There were no circumstances in which it was appropriate to vary an agreement that the parties had relied upon in structuring their affairs on an interim basis. If the court was to order interim spousals support where there was an agreement, it should be cautious not to pre-judge the issue and thereby usurp the role of the trial judge. 4)The parties had signed a comprehensive agreement which dealt with parenting issues, child support, child and education. Under the agreement, the respondent received lump sum, ongoing and ongoing support of approximately $5,000 and $1,000 per month.

b_2006nssc221.txt,"Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement. Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years.

The applicant argued that the divorce settlement had left her deeply in debt and that the respondent had failed to take advantage of that debt. Application allowed; the respondent's obligation to provide $175,000 per month was reduced to $5,500 per month after the expiry of the support payments; there was no pressure exerted upon the applicant and no oppression during the course of the negotiations or the signing of the Agreement and the rental income more than covered the mortgage payment. There was no evidence of coersion or anything of that nature. Both parties were preparing their own agreement in satisfaction of all claims for support, interim support, possession of or title to property or any other claim arising out of the marriage and in assessing whether there has been substantial compliance with the objectives of the Divorce Act. The Agreement was sound when it was signed and there have been no material changes in the circumstances of either party. However, the respondent did not have access to financial advice prior to signing and he borrowed money from the applicant which was a debt that she voluntarily assumed. The couple had obtained an order varying, rescinding, suspending, suspending or restoring (a) and/or (b) of support in respect of the corollary relief judgment in 2004. In 2005 the applicant applied pursuant to section 17(4)(a) of the Act for variation of the terms of the agreement. The onus is on the applicant to satisfy the Court that the Agreement was in substantial compliance. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The agreement was sound and the parties were bound by its objectives.  2)There had been no change in circumstances nor in the manner in which the parties entered into the agreement and therefore the agreement was not unconscionable. 3)The Agreement was based on a reasonable understanding of the circumstances in which each party was bound. The greater the vulnerabilities present at the moment of formation, the more searching the court's review at this stage could not be condoned. 4)There was no breach of any of the obligations under the Act","[1] The Applicant, Marie-Louise Stening-Riding, has applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties’ Corollary Relief Judgment dated February 20th, 2003. At the same time as their divorce was granted a Corollary Relief Judgment was also granted which incorporated the terms of an agreement signed by the parties dated January 30, 2003. She proposed that the monthly support be increased to a figure that more closely resembles that which would be assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines and that she receive a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the “underpayment” of spousal support since the 1st of February 2003. [27] I find that there was no pressure exerted by the Respondent upon the Applicant and no oppression during the course of the negotiations or the signing of the Agreement and I find further that the Respondent did not take advantage of any vulnerability of the Applicant as contemplated by the Supreme Court in Miglin (supra). [35] Although the parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation, in determining the appropriate spousal support terms, one has to take into account a number of factors including the Respondent’s age, his health (which has not been good) and the reasonable expectation of retirement. The Applicant should have been aware that whereas she was in her late fifties when she received her doctorate the prospects of her obtaining a full-time teaching position at a university in the narrow field of her expertise were far from great. It was completely foreseeable that she would have difficulty and perhaps no chance at all of obtaining such a position. [47] The incomes of both parties have increased since the Agreement was signed but that too was a foreseeable event. I do not consider the increased appraised value of the Respondent’s real estate to be a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties’ Agreement. [54] In conclusion, the current circumstances of the parties are not a “significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties” when they signed their Agreement. The application is dismissed.",0.5194479297365119,0.4939597315436241,"The applicant sought to vary spousal support in accordance with the terms of their Corollary Relief Judgment. The parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation and had a child, who is now independent of the respondent. The respondent moved from the matrimonial home and the parties divorced in February 2003. At the time of the divorce, the respondent granted a corollary relief judgment incorporated into the agreement. The applicant applied under s. 15.2 of the Divorce Act to vary the spousals of the parties' agreement. Application allowed; the onus is on the applicant to satisfy the Court that the Agreement was not in substantial compliance with the objectives of the Act and that the Respondent did not take advantage of any vulnerability of the applicant. Although both parties were in their early fifties when the parties received their doctorate, the marriage had lasted less than two years and the applicant had spent time and money trying to obtain employment. Both parties wanted a final agreement so as to avoid the necessity of future court proceedings. Retirement was contemplated by both parties and by the respondent assumed that she would be able to obtain a mortgage on a home acquired by the applicant but that was offset by the husband's assumption of debts far greater in value than the debts assumed by the Applicant. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The Agreement was sound when it was signed. There was no pressure exerted upon the applicant and no oppression during the negotiations or the signing of the Agreement and the rental income more than covered the mortgage payment. 2)There was no evidence of coersion or anything of that nature.  3)The agreement was binding. There were no changes in circumstances since the signing. The husband was left essentially debt free while the husband was assuming debts in excess of $300,000. 4)There had been no material change in the circumstances of either party. The Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines were not law. The agreement was crafted to reflect the times and circumstances of each party.  5)There were no adverse consequences to the application in light of the new circumstances (e.g. the reduction in legal fees and accounting fees relating to the divorce proceedings and these variations proceedings) but it was a debt that was voluntarily assumed.  6)The applicant had the assistance of very experienced counsel. She borrowed $150,000 on line of credit, using her home as security, to purchase mutual funds as an investment. She received a lump sum to offset the interest on the mortgage.",0.5020242914979757,b_2006nssc221.txt,"Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement."

c_2006skqb335.txt,"FIAT: The former vice-president of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan. He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour. He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application. Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart. It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart. The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart. HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed. The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart. Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations. Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart. However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. That is not good enough.","FIAT. Wal-Mart brought three applications. The first motion was brought by the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFWC) which sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and Rule 673 prohibiting the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board as presently constituted from hearing and/or making any orders involving the applicant. In the other motion the union applied for an order striking and removing virtually all the material filed in support of the application. In both applications, the union sought to have the Board strike and remove virtually all of the materials filed. The applicant argued that the Board interfered with its operation by requiring members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. HELD: The relief sought by the Union was granted. The application was dismissed. 1) There is no necessity for their admission. The respondent must be available to swear an affidavit. The critical allegations originate with him. Absent any explanation for his absence, there is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proferred documents as evidence. 2) The affidavits filed by the union are admissible. They are attached to an affidavit of one of its members who attests that he prepared the transcript of the radio broadcast. That does nothing more than prove he performed that task. It says nothing about the accuracy, truth or reliability of what is contained in the transcript. 3) The admissibility of the two affidavits by the applicant and the union is not supported by admissible evidence. It is impossible to conclude bias exists within the labour Relations board or that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias against it. 4) The statements of claim in Walter Matkowski v. Government of Saskatchewan et al. filed in Saskatoon contain only three paragraphs but are four pages in length. The reader will best understand the affidavit if it is quoted in full.  5) The affidavit of a former vice-chairperson of the SEDB confirms the existence of these documents. They were admissible by reason of s. 7 of The Saskatchewan Evidence Act, S.S., c. C-16. Publications in The Saskatchewan Gazette and all copies of the statutes, the journals of the legislature, sessional papers and all other documents printed or purporting to be printed by the Saskatchewan Legislature shall be deemed to be deemed as authentic and thus admissible as well.  6) The portions of an article from the Regina Leader-Post and a copy of the Labour Reporter newsletter were not admissible to prove the accuracy and truth of what was said. 7) The","[3] I have concluded that the relief sought by the Union should be granted and that the application brought by Wal-Mart Canada Corp. should be dismissed.

The first motion was brought by the applicant, Wal-mart Canada Corp., which sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and 673 prohibiting the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board as presently constituted from hearing and/or making any orders involving Wal-Marts.

6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","This is an appeal by the Crown from an order of a Provincial Court Judge declaring that the respondent is unfit to stand trial. The Crown submits that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, misstated the evidence, applies the wrong legal test for fitness, applied the wrong burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The limited cognitive capacity test (limited cognitive capacity) test strikes an effective balance between the objectives of the fitness rules and the constitutional right of the accused to choose his own defence and to have a trial within a reasonable time. 2) The respondent is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse/dependence disorder. He has been diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and is unable to distinguish reality from fantasy. 3) As the appellant has grown up and started residing in foster care, it is pertinent to note that he has consistently run away from the protected environments sought for him and has begun to abuse alcohol and drugs. 4) There are strong interests, both public and personal, in an accused being fit to proceed to trial. In this case, the public interest is in ensuring that persons who are accused of committing crimes are brought to justice. The personal interests are paramount. 5) The Court adopted the higher threshold 'analytic capacity' test for determining fitness. This test is not intended to displace the presumption of innocence to which he remains entitled. The real question to be determined is whether the learned trial judge erred in holding that although the appellant can communicate with his lawyer and assist counsel in his/her defence, the accused must be able to interpret the nature of the proceedings and to appreciate his own best interest. The failure to provide a plea authorized by s. 16 restricts the accused's ability to make rational decisions beneficial to himself. 6) In asking the court to require that the accused be capable of making rational decisions in the exercise of his or her right, the court is asking this court to adopt a higher threshold threshold for fitness. The test has clearly been rejected by the courts. 7) Applying the test in R. v. Gorecki (1976), 32 C.C.C.(2d) 129 (Ont.

In this case, the public interests outweigh the interests of the general public. The respondent was charged with a total of 29 offences committed between March 25, 2006 and August 26, 2007. Most of these were summary conviction offences arising out of multiple failures to comply with various bail conditions including: breach of curfew (five charges), failing to attend school, failing to reside in a designated residence, and failing to not possess, keep or consume alcohol (four charges). He was also charged with two indictable offences: two counts of breach of bail conditions and one count of obstruction of a peace officer by providing false name. 5) The Court concludes that the evidence of the Crown and the parties that the appellant is incapable of instructing counsel as he does not have the capacity to interpret the evidence and to present a rational decision. The evidence of a psychiatrist who assessed the respondent as having a high threshold for the ability to instruct counsel derogates from the fundamental principle that an accused is entitled to choice his own self-defence. The psychiatrist concluded that he would therefore be unable to instruct in a manner that would be in his best interests and that he, in fact, resist the assistance of counsel altogether.

He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies.

6_2009skqb272.txt,"The accused was found guilty of the following offence: for a sexual purpose touching A. M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code. After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions. HELD: The accused is sentenced to 9 months incarceration. Pursuant to s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code, a firearm order was made for 10 years prohibiting the accused from possessing any type of weapon. The accused shall also supply a sample of his DNA for analysis. There is an order under s. 490.012(1) that the accused comply with the Sexual Offender Information Registration Act. The accused is also prohibited, pursuant to an order under s. 161(1)(a), from attending a public park or swimming area where persons under the age of 14 years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, day care centre, school ground, playground or community centre for a period of 3 years.","The 37 year old accused pleaded guilty to a charge of sexually touching a person under the age of 14 years, contrary to s. 151(1) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute. In addition, the Crown applied for s. 490.012 of the Code prohibiting S.C. from engaging in certain employment involving positions of trust or authority towards persons under the ages of 16 years and prohibiting him from attending certain places as provided for by s. 161 of the code. HELD: The sentence was increased to 10 years.  1) This is not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The physical and sexual abuse that he suffered at the hands of his family members have haunted and affected him throughout his life. Failure of the justice system and the courts to protect young people by imposing jail sentences that will serve to denounce and deter abusive behaviour towards children will only perpetuate the kind of abuse and consequences that S., the accused in this case, has himself experienced and from which he still suffers. 2) There can be no question by virtue of the recent amendments to the Code that the Parliament of Canada has clearly sought to protect the children and young people of this country from the abuse of adults. It has done so by enacting the provisions of s. 718.01 mandating a mandatory prohibition order from possessing firearms, cross-bow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition and explosive substance during the course of his incarceration and, subsequently, this probation order. A further order shall issue pursuant to ss. 487.051(2) authorizing and ordering you to provide sufficient samples of your bodily substances so that a DNA analysis may be conducted. The length of the sentence requested by the Crown will be years less one day.","[1] On June 5, 2009, this Court, in a written judgment (the “Judgment”) found the accused guilty of the following offence:



COUNT 1 THAT HE, the said S. C. [sic], on or between the 20th day of May and the 22nd of December, A. D. 2005 at Muscowpetung First Nation, Saskatchewan did for a sexual purpose touch A. M. [sic] a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body, to wit: his hand, contrary to Section 151(a) of the Criminal Code. CONCLUSION [34] This is not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate.

She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party.

The mother opposed the application and requested that the matter be set aside for a further organizational pretrial to be held in November. HELD: Application dismissed. The court found that the evidence did not support the father's contention that his marijuana use was a risk to his children. It was also found that his evidence of the children's concerns about his medical condition and its possible effect on his driving was not supported by his children's information. Therefore, the court ordered the reinstatement of the access provisions. The evidence showed that the father took into account and accepted responsibility for some of the circumstances leading to the failure of his children to visit his father. Although the father had indicated that he would not allow the children to use marijuana in the presence of his mother, it was assumed that his use was benign and without potential risk for his children as the marijuana use had not been found to be a significant issue.","Ms. Crewe requested a change to the Varied Corollary Relief Judgment dated

e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent seeks to expunge child support arrears that have accumulated as a result of his not paying child support for many years. He is 72 years old and practising internal medicine and is looking to retire in the next few years. HELD: 1) The respondent will have few lean years until he has paid off the arrearns. He did not have the ability to pay them willingly it had to be snatched away from him.  2) The petitioner has struggled for 25 years to get the respondent to pay child support. He was adamant that he should not pay more than $2,000 a month because he was expected to maximize his earning capacity. Now, some 12 years later, he is in the black. It is commonplace for a payor to stop recording ongoing child support payments once the children have turned 18. The respondent's child support obligation under the 2001 order continued even though the respondent did not record it on its statement. It appears that he is trying to reduce his child support obligations. 3) There is no undue hardship to either party. The petitioner had always been a child of the marriage. The 2001 order imputed her income $109,912 and the s. Guideline amount of $55,620 was reduced to $1,687 in 2001 when his income was imputed to be $111,940. 4) It is immaterial at this stage that the respondent has not paid child support in excess of $30,000 in the past 25 years. The burden of proof is on him to establish on a balance of probabilities that he cannot now pay and will not in the future be able to pay the child support that he owes. The Court cannot attribute to him the amount of child support owed by the petitioner with respect to his actual income over the years.

After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent seeks to expunge child support arrears that have accumulated as a result of his not paying it for many years.

She is trying to obtain employment that pays her an annual income of $109,912. HELD: 1) The respondent’s application was dismissed.  2) The court found that the respondent did not have the ability to pay the child support owed. It would not be appropriate to reduce child support based on his actual income over the years. 3) There was no undue hardship. The respondent had not been paying child support for some time and, in some cases, had to resort to welfare to provide for the children. 4) There were no special circumstances on which the respondent could have taken employment that paid him $110,000 a year. He knew that he was expected to maximize his earning capacity but simply chose not to. 5) The petitioner was not able to work as a registered nurse. She was on long-term disability and could not put her children into extracurricular activities.

He did not have the ability to pay them willingly it had to be snatched away from him.  2) The petitioner has struggled for 25 years to get the respondent to pay child support. He was adamant that he should not pay more than $2,000 a month because he was expected to maximize his earning capacity. Now, some 12 years later, he is in the black. It is commonplace for a payor to stop recording ongoing child support payments once the children have turned 18. The respondent's child support obligation under the 2001 order continued even though the respondent did not record it on its statement. It appears that he is trying to reduce his child support obligations. 3) There is no undue hardship to either party. The petitioner had always been a child of the marriage. The 2001 order imputed her income $109,912 and varied accordingly. The s. Guideline amount for this period was $1,493 per month for a total of $107,496 ($1,683 72). 4) On balance of probabilities, the respondent cannot be found to have exceeded the imputed income. The only reason he chose to overpay is because he is seeking to further his career. The Court cannot find that he has not exceeded his means in supporting his children. 5) The father's pattern of non-payment is blameworthy. He has not been complying with any of the many support orders that have issued over the last 25 years and does not want the issue of child support to interfere with his plans. He does not have an unreasonable desire to lessen his obligation to pay. His family law practice is one of the reasons he chose not to seek employment in the United States or Canada. 6) Applying the criteria set out in Wurmlinger and D.B.S., the Court found that the respondent has not shown an unreasonable hardship based on his actual income over the years.","3) The respondent seeks to vary two orders, one that was issued in 1998 and the other that was issued in 2001.

Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor."

The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody.

The Crown applied under section 42(9) for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence pursuant to R. v. D.C.V. (2005) SCC 78.

[61] The writer of the pre-sentence report suggests that a period of secure custody and supervision would allow for N.B.L.’s referral to support services such as the psychologist from the High Risk Violent Young Offender Initiative, an addictions counsellor and a mentor while in custody. [62] Further, a lengthy sentence would allow the time frame required for N.B.L. to stabilize and engage with support services prior to his release in the community. SENTENCE [63] On the aggravated assault (Information 44662780), it is my view that the appropriate sentence is a secure custodial sentence of 24 months to be followed by a period of probation. Affording him credit of 6 months for pre-sentence detention, I impose a sentence of an additional period of 18 months, 12 months of which will be served in closed custody followed by 6 months of community supervision.",0.5168195718654435,0.4377358490566037,"The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","The accused pleaded guilty to aggravated assault thereby endangering the life of the victim contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that he report to his youth worker contrary to ss. 137 and 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The Crown applied under section 42(9) for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence pursuant to R. v. D.(W.J.), [2005] SCC 78. HELD: A secure custodial sentence of 24 months to be followed by a period of probation with credit for pre-sentence detention and 6 months of community supervision. An additional period of 18 months would allow the time frame required to stabilize and engage with support services prior to his release in the community. 1) The young person did not oppose the Crown's application. 2) A period of custody was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. The Court had little confidence that this young person would successfully comply with the conditions set out in the YCJA. 3) The aggravating factors were the egregious nature of the assault, including repeated blows with a weapon and the resulting serious harm done to the victim. The harm was intentional and foreseeable and interfered in a substantial way with the physical and psychological integrity, health and well-being of the victims and his family.","He has also pleaded guilty to breaching his undertaking to keep the peace and be of good behaviour, contrary to s. 145(3) of the Criminal Code and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that he report to his youth worker, contrary to s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA). [3] The Crown applied under section 42(9) of the YCJA for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence. [12] On the aggravated assault, the Crown seeks the maximum allowable custodial sentence of 24 months and submits that 16 months of that sentence ought to be served in a secure setting, followed by 8 months of community supervision. [20] Mr. Fischer will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of this offence. [21] In these circumstances, and given the young person did not oppose the Crown’s application, I find this was a serious violent offence and I designate it as such, pursuant to s. 42(9) of the YCJA. [37] Aggravating factors are the egregious nature of the assault, including repeated blows with a weapon and the resulting serious harm done to the victim.

In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision.

The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT. The applicants were charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana. They were scheduled for separate trials this fall before Judge and Jury. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the warrant: a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance on each accused and a 9 day video surveillance authorization authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. A search warrant to search the residence of each accused issued in April 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones. In general terms it is the position of the applicants that the authorization for the electronic surveillance should be set aside, and as information obtained from the Electronic Surveillance was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant and the subsequent search warrant both of these warrants should also be set Aside on the basis they are derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful. The granting of leave to cross-examine is justified in these circumstances in order to prevent an abuse of what is essentially a ruling on the admissibility of evidence on the Charter hearing. It would appear that given the 1993 amendments to s. 187 of the Code, there is no reason that the granting of a free cross-examination should be the preserve of the trial judge. Why should legitimate discovery be delayed? Why should provincial court judge not be permitted to apply very simple test to assure against prolixity, irrelevance, and well-known policy concerns? Cross-examination will disclose facts to the accused but they will only become admissible at trial by leave of the court judge. In this respect, R. v. West (1998), 12 C.R. (5th) 106, is a strong directive to that end. This should not be considered as a usurpation of a trial judge's function. Where leave is granted at the preliminary inquiry stage to conduct cross- examination of police witnesses with respect to an authorization as it was in this case, it is not obvious why such evidence should not been admissible on an application at trial to set off the authorization, bearing in mind the Crown has the right to call evidence to expand, explain or add to the evidence elicited at the Preliminary inquiry such as the application that would require a stay of proceedings on all charges against both applicants.","As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel have brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside: (1) A section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance on each accused dated January 30, 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones. (2) A section 487.01(4) 9 day video surveillance authorization dated March 19, 1997 for the residence of the applicant Derksen authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast.

As a result, the boilerplate paragraphs offered on why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had or have no factual basis. In the end result, the applicant’s have satisfied the burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that the pre-conditions for the granting of an authorization set out in s. 186(1)(b) were not met. As a result the authorization dated January 30, 1997 is set aside. [28] The interceptions which occurred pursuant to the authorization of January 30, 1997 constituted a search and seizure within the meaning of s. 8 of the Charter, and as the search was not authorized by law the search was unreasonable and in breach of that section (Vide: R. v. Garofoli, supra, per Sopinka J. at p. 187). The video surveillance warrant therefore must be set aside. A good faith argument is not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the electronic surveillance authorization.

One associate is a, who has also been in marihuana cultivation for years. [54] The absence of compellable detail of the alleged offence and the absence of the source of the informer’s knowledge means the information supplied for the Derksen search warrant did not provide a basis for the issuing justice of the peace to conclude reasonable and probable grounds existed for the issuance of the warrant, and the warrant must be set aside.

As a result, on balance I conclude the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence. [67] In the end result, the seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the marihuana plants obtained, which is crucial to any successful prosecution of Mr. Derksen, outweighs the breach of his s. 8 Charter rights to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. I conclude it is more likely than not that exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of his premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. With respect to the improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused, this is a collateral matter and does not affect the fairness of the trial. The application for a stay of proceedings is dismissed.",0.4625984251968503,0.3794531897265949,"FIAT. The applicants were charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana. They were scheduled for separate trials this fall before Judge and Jury. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the authorization: a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance directed at their residences and their cell phones and a 9 day video surveillance authorization authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. A search warrant to search the applicant's residence in April 1997 which resulted in the seizure of 365 plants and led to the present charges. HELD: 1) Leave to cross-examine was granted. Leave should be left to the exercise of the discretion of the trial judge. 2) The authorization was set aside as information obtained from the electronic surveillance was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant and the subsequent search warrant both of these warrants should be set aside on the basis they are derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful. 3) The applicant sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrants and a stay of proceedings excluded from trial. 4) The Crown did not err in arguing that evidence tendered at preliminary inquiry should not be used as trial evidence in order to prevent an abuse of what is essentially a ruling on the admissibility of evidence. Given the 1993 amendments to s. 187 of the Code, there is no reason that the granting of leave to cross examine should be the preserve of the court judge. The fact that the applicant did not consider this possible is a strong directive to that end. 5) The use of an undercover police officer or police agent is not the general rule. Cross-examination will disclose facts to the accused but they will only become admissible at trial by leave of the judge. R. v. West (1998), 12 C.R. (5th) 106. Preliminary inquiry evidence: The Crown obtained an edited copy of the affidavits used to obtain the authorization in the Dosch case. The editing included deletion of all dates on which the police obtained information about a grow operation. The blanks were filled in to verify some of the information he had received from the informant. The balance of this paragraph consisting of sub-clauses (b) to (h) have been edited out. It would appear to be an absolute waste of time and money to require duplication of such evidence on the Charter hearing.",0.4721161191749427,6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial."

The appellants did not lead evidence at trial. They did not dispute that they were keeping cattle on their property. Their defence related to points of law. HELD: The application to admit new evidence was dismissed. 1)The appellation's use of the word 'hamlet' in reference to the bylaw does not bear upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue at the trial. The bylaws and bylaws of the rural municipality do not reference livestock in the sense of a hamlet since they do not refer to a particular type of livestock. In the absence of a specific definition of livestock, the word is uncertain. It can be defined so broadly as to be either meaningless or unenforceable. 2)The three bylaws tendered by appellants that were tendered to them in 2006 did not reference cattle. They were in position to peruse the bylaws relating to districts labelled hamlet and learn of the rules governing their property including the rule prohibiting cattle in that zoning district. The second bylaw purports to be an amendment to the rural Municipality's basic planning statement and its relevance to the issues was not apparent. The amendments in this document are not reflected in the version of the zoning bylaw that was put in evidence. 3)In any event, the uncertainty suggested by these appellants does not exist. Under the previous regime no livestock is permitted in the district. Cattle are livestock, and so cattle are not permitted in district zoned Hamlet. Cement, livestock and other living creatures that might be kept by people, including bees and butterflies, are not allowed in that district. 4)Human error in lawThe trial justice made no errors in law.

The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order.

2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender.

The accused pled guilty to assaulting a peace officer with a weapon. The offence was a serious personal injury offence as defined by ss. 753.1. The offender had 67 prior convictions, four of them for violence. The offences were violent, one of which involved stabbing the officer in the face. The officer fired his taser at the accused, who was trying to break free of the wires and the police officer was forced to back away. At paragraph 41 of the pre-sentence statement, the court found that the accused was approximately eight feet away when he was cornered by the police and the officer, and there was no attempt to try and strike either officer. It would appear that this offence is a'serious personal injury offense' as defined in s.752 as well as a long-term offence, and the accused's conduct endangered or was likely to endanger the life or safety of the officer. The Court found that given the serious nature of the offence, which included 58 Criminal Code convictions, a penitentiary sentence was warranted given the offender's record and the number of convictions.","[2] The Crown has applied, pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code, for an order remanding Mr. Ben for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have Mr. Ben declared a dangerous offender.

[23] I find this offence is a “serious personal injury offence” as defined by s. 752. [40] I find that given the number and nature of violent offences on Mr. Ben’s record, and that many of those violent offences involve peace officers and alcohol use, a pattern of behaviour has been established. [49] I find that given the serious nature of this offence, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years, and taking into account Mr. Ben’s previous record, a sentence of two years or more is possible. [51] For all these reasons, I find that it is not beyond the realm of possibility that Mr. Ben could be found to be a dangerous offender.

The crimes of violence for which the accused has been convicted include the assault of a police officer which occurred when he was cornered by two officers and a large tree branch which was about seven feet long and three-quarters to two inches in diameter. The police officer fired his taser at the accused, coming so close to the officer that it caused him to back away and pull his sidearm. At paragraph 41 of the judgment, the Crown referred to R. v. Ponticorvo, 2009 SKQB 350 (CanLII), in which the Court held that a penitentiary sentence is warranted given the accused's record, his violent conduct, his record, the offences of violence against the peace officer and his repeated breaches of mandatory supervision and breaches of his parole.

The weapon was of such a size that, as I noted when giving the decision after trial, “there is no doubt that if struck in the head with this object, it could cause serious damage”. [23] I find this offence is a “serious personal injury offence” as defined by s. 752. [40] I find that given the number and nature of violent offences on Mr. Ben’s record, and that many of those violent offences involve peace officers and alcohol use, a pattern of behaviour has been established. [49] I find that given the serious nature of this offence, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years, and taking into account Mr. Ben’s previous record, a sentence of two years or more is possible. [51] For all these reasons, I find that it is not beyond the realm of possibility that Mr. Ben could be found to be a dangerous offender.

The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused was convicted of assaulting a peace officer. HELD: The Court found that given the accused’s record and the fact that he had 58 Criminal Code convictions, the offence of assault with a weapon carries a maximum penalty of 10 years and the application must be satisfied that the offence is a serious personal injury offence, which is prerequisite to ordering an assessment. This would appear to be a burden far less than the criminal burden of proof and even less than that of a civil liability of proof. However, the accused had a lengthy and related criminal record. The offences were violent and the accused displayed extreme indifference to his fellow officers.","[2] The Crown has applied, pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code, for an order remanding Mr. Ben for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have Mr. Ben declared a dangerous offender.

The accused pled guilty to assaulting a peace officer with a weapon. The offence was a serious personal injury offence as defined by ss. 753.1. The offender had 67 prior convictions, four of them for violence. The offences were violent, one of which involved stabbing the officer in the face. The officer fired his taser at the accused, who was trying to break free of the wires and the police officer was forced to back away. At paragraph 41 of the pre-sentence statement, the court found that the accused was approximately eight feet away when he was cornered by the police and the officer, and there was no attempt to try and strike either officer. It would appear that this offence is a'serious personal injury offense' as defined in s.752 as well as a long-term offence, and the accused's conduct endangered or was likely to endanger the life or safety of the officer.

e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists.

Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated.

After he determined the respondent was operating his motor vehicle while impaired, he arrested the respondent, read the respondent his right to retain counsel and gave the requisite police warning. The subsequent breathalyzer certificate was excluded from the evidence.

The trial judge concluded that a warning was required to the respondent after he asserted the right to counsel and the obligation on the part of police during this time to refrain from having them participate in any process that would incriminate him. 4) The Certificate of Analysis was excluded.","[1] The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent’s rights under s. 10 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent.

The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children.

The respondent took the position that the petitioner's allegations of sexual abuse were unreliable and that there was a risk of harm. Therefore, the Court applied the Risk of Harm test, holding that the allegations were based upon speculation, conjecture, suspicion or unreliable testimony and that the harm test was not accepted. The court found that increased contact between the respondent and the children would in fact be beneficial.

The evidence did not support the respondent's contention that he was the only person to put the children to bed. 2)The respondent was found to have been significantly involved in his children's lives beyond the level of most fathers who have normal work commitments. 3)Discretion was not appropriate. 4)The petitioner had provided factual evidence as background. Much of it is expressly disputed by the respondent or implicitly acknowledged by him. However, the onus is on parents who seek to restrict maximum contact to satisfy the court there is good reason to restrict contact.

Also, there were uncertain prospects for the wife's future employment. 2)The respondent was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the $1500.00 maintenance he consistently paid up to December 1995 to $ 1,000 without at least consulting with the wife. Had these payments continued the applicant would have recovered $6,000 at this point in time instead of the $4,000 she received in April and in April. 3)The petitioner had been paid $3000.00 per month since December 1994. She claimed she had received only a total of $ 3,000. None of the allegations were refuted. The respondent was entitled to vary the maintenance he was paid in relation to the number of months he was paying. 4)The Court allowed the petitioner to have her costs of the matrimonial home sold and the net proceeds from the sale of the home to be distributed to the spouses. 5)The court allowed the respondent to unilaterally trim the respondent's maintenance he had paid up until December 1995 by an amount not in the amount sought. 6)It was premature on this application to fix the amount of spouse maintenance that the applicanthas asked for at the suggested guideline figure. There are too numerous unknown factors including the future status of the spouse whose future employment is uncertain. There is no evidence that she will require a return to her previous income. The Court was of the opinion that this was an interim application.","In my opinion it is premature on this application to

HELD: It is within the purview of the Board to interpret s.37 and on an application to quash, the first question to be asked by the reviewing court is whether the interpretation is patently unreasonable. The interpretation of the board of s.37 was not patently unreasonable. It does not apply to other areas of the law, such as financing, conveyance of property or insurance, where a more precise and predictable delineation may be appropriate. The Board is interpreting s.37 for the purposes of labour law alone. Appeal Allowed."

6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff purchased a home in 1998. She engaged the services of the defendant Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased the property in 1999. It was then that the plaintiff discovered that cracks were appearing in the attic of the house. She sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the home. She alleged that Mui and her husband were negligent in misrepresenting facts and breached their fiduciary duty expected of them. She also claimed aggravated damages against the defendants and punitive damages against them for failing to obtain a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. HELD: 1) The inspection of the property by the Rural Municipality of Corman Park was only granted in June 1999. There was no discussion about home inspection or extending the deadline to remove the conditions so that further investigations could be carried out. The search for a suitable home then expanded to acreages in the neighbouring environs. 2) The first time the plaintiff visited the property she was surprised to find that there were cracks in the eaves. She assumed that the problem was caused by the defendant Mui's work. She was wrong. The realtor's work was done in good faith and without any problems. The PCDS was a patent invention and the law of caveat emptor applies. The fact that the PCDS did not exist at the time of the inspection did not affect the plaintiff's determination of whether or not the home had been moved and whether any defects existed in it.  3) The plaintiff was wrong in assuming that all necessary repairs and maintenance would be performed by the defendants. The defendants were not performing their duties as realtors. 4) The court found that the defendants were liable to the plaintiff in damages both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the plaintiff.  5) Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She says that Ms. Mui and RE/MAX Saskatoon fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, according to Ms. Schira, similarly misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently, both in information given to her which induced her, in part, to purchase the home, and in answers that they gave in a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. 106) With the above in mind, I have determined that certain of the evidence of each of Mr. Karpinski, Mrs. Karpinski and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. I have, accordingly, accepted the observations of Mr. Loraas and the opinions of Mr. Epp. 123) In considering the liability of each of the defendants I have, as previously noted, accepted the conclusions and opinions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp. In particular, I find:
(i) The pine shakes were rotting and many were cracked to such an extent that water could permeate the underlying joints and decking. 130) In this case, I have concluded that Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski did not speak “truthfully and completely” when answering all the questions in the PCDS. However, given their lack of veracity on key issues, I do not accept that they were unaware of other water and moisture damage, whether arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or inadequate venting that was occurring elsewhere in the interior of the house. Accordingly I find Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski liable to Ms. Schira for breach of contract for failing to disclose in questions B, F and G of the PCDS the existence of structural defects, damage due to water, and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the Karpinskis and Ms. Schira, and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. For reasons already set out, I would find that the false representations knowingly made by Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, and their silence as to material facts, were fraudulent. I have concluded that Ms. Mui was negligent and that her conduct and advice to Ms. Schira fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. Further, had Ms. Mui fulfilled her obligation first to disclose all material facts to Ms. Schira, and second, to explain and, in these circumstances, recommend a home inspection, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the outcome for Ms. Schira would have been different. 148) I am satisfied however that Mr. Jacobucci is liable to Ms. Schira for negligent misrepresentation. I award Ms. Schira $15,000 as compensation for the personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the house. However, there is no evidence that the distress that she experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness. 166) There will be an award for aggravated damages, with respect to all defendants, in the amount of $10,000. 169) This aspect of Ms. Schira’s claim for damages is accordingly dismissed. Conclusion 176) While Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski are liable for breach of contract, each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to Ms. Schira, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. 1. Ms. Schira shall have judgment against the defendants in the amount of $49,608.87. 1.

The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff decided to purchase a home. She engaged the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant, 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased a country home. It was owned by the defendants and their realtor, who was hired by the plaintiff to advise her that there had been a problem with the skylight in the house and that she could not realistically afford to buy the home. The defendant, who had recently purchased a new home, also misrepresented facts to the plaintiff, namely that the home had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site, in so doing, it is alleged that they breached the terms of the contract between them. HELD: The plaintiff sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in her home.  1) The evidence from the realtor was that the house had been heated by wood, which caused cracks in the eaves, peepholes in the attic and a gas line onto the property. The rural municipality did not do any inspections of moved or newly constructed residences.  2) There was no discussion about home inspection. The realtor looked at nothing in particular since the rural municipality had not done any such inspections prior to 2000. The Rural Municipality of Corman Park did not inspect the property and did not provide a copy of the building permit. 3) The plaintiff was awarded aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against the husband and wife for failing to obtain a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition in the contract for sale. The offer was made at the expense of the plaintiff. The husband was not the only one buying the property at the time. The wife was the primary caretaker of the home during the construction of the house. She was involved in the preparation of the PCDS and in the execution of the inspection. 4) The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to costs in the amount of $1,000,000 for each year that she paid for the home, and that the husband was to pay $250,000 to have the home delivered. The PCDS would be incorporated into the agreement for a further 50 years. The parties were also entitled to solicitor-client costs. 5) Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She says that Ms. Mui and RE/MAX Saskatoon fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, according to Ms. Schira, similarly misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently, both in information given to her which induced her, in part, to purchase the home, and in answers that they gave in a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. 106) With the above in mind, I have determined that certain of the evidence of each of Mr. Karpinski, Mrs. Karpinski and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. I have, accordingly, accepted the observations of Mr. Loraas and the opinions of Mr. Epp. 123) In considering the liability of each of the defendants I have, as previously noted, accepted the conclusions and opinions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp. In particular, I find:
(i) The pine shakes were rotting and many were cracked to such an extent that water could permeate the underlying joints and decking. 130) In this case, I have concluded that Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski did not speak “truthfully and completely” when answering all the questions in the PCDS. However, given their lack of veracity on key issues, I do not accept that they were unaware of other water and moisture damage, whether arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or inadequate venting that was occurring elsewhere in the interior of the house. Accordingly I find Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski liable to Ms. Schira for breach of contract for failing to disclose in questions B, F and G of the PCDS the existence of structural defects, damage due to water, and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the Karpinskis and Ms. Schira, and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. For reasons already set out, I would find that the false representations knowingly made by Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, and their silence as to material facts, were fraudulent. I have concluded that Ms. Mui was negligent and that her conduct and advice to Ms. Schira fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. Further, had Ms. Mui fulfilled her obligation first to disclose all material facts to Ms. Schira, and second, to explain and, in these circumstances, recommend a home inspection, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the outcome for Ms. Schira would have been different. 148) I am satisfied however that Mr. Jacobucci is liable to Ms. Schira for negligent misrepresentation. I award Ms. Schira $15,000 as compensation for the personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the house. However, there is no evidence that the distress that she experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness. 166) There will be an award for aggravated damages, with respect to all defendants, in the amount of $10,000. 169) This aspect of Ms. Schira’s claim for damages is accordingly dismissed. Conclusion 176) While Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski are liable for breach of contract, each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to Ms. Schira, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. 1.

She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting.

The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS.

The defendants failed to tell her the home had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site. Water entered through a dormer window with rotting casing. The plaintiff sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She alleged that Mui and her husband were negligent in misrepresenting facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of them.

It was only then that she realized that the building permit issued by the Municipality had been revoked. 2) There was no discussion about home inspection. The search for suitable home expanded to acreages in the neighbouring environs. The realtor was a friend of the plaintiff.

He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company (STC). The plaintiff was the former president and chief executive officer of the provincial Crown corporation.STC awarded damages against the corporation in the amount of $165,000. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as were either earned or should have beenearned in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum; and third, that all of the plaintiff's Crown corporation service had been for one year rather than three, or two, rather than five or even ten. The plaintiff resisted the attribution on pragmatic grounds arguing that the company had not paid any salary; that there was no guarantee the company was going to earn profit; that it needed working capital; and that it was mere fledging.","This is an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company by Leo Larsen, its former President and Chief Executive Officer.

The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln to Her Majesty in Right of Canada.

A lesser test would tend to trivialise the Charter and would result in the denial of relief. 4) The court must first consider the gravity of an offence, the personal characteristics of the offender, the standard of care available to the general public and the law in general. 5) The applicant must satisfy the judge hearing the application that she is innocent of any complicity in the designated substance offence and that she exercised all reasonable custody to be sure the property did not fall within the definition of 'offence-related property'. 6) It is not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s19(3), however, because Crown counsel consented.","[3] The Crown has now applied, pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19 (the ""Act"") for an order forfeiting the Lincoln to Her Majesty in Right of Canada.

He was granted supervised access. 2) The grandmother was found to be person sufficient interest in relation to the issues. There was no evidence that her access to the children was sporadic prior to the death of Megan Wolfe. The evidence from the parties’ prior settlement conference was considered sufficient to warrant an order for supervised access by the grandmother.  3) There were no grounds to grant a finding of sufficiency in the evidence as to whether the grandmother met the objectives of the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board. The proper focus of an inquiry is to determine whether the applicant can show a settled commitment to the child and an intention to be continuing and meaningful presence in the life of the child. In this case, it was the grandmother who met the requirements of the Act by virtue of the fact that she was the primary caregiver for the children. 4) There is no evidence of the father having reasonable and liberal access.

level of income replacement benefits as at September 24

desperate circumstances in October, 1997 and resulting
conduct on October 1 and thereafter. The court therefore
finds that SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw\'s
benefits pursuant to s. 185(d), (e), (f) or (g). Accordingly, pursuant to s. 198(3)(b), the court
finds that in accordance with s. 129(1)(e) Sawkiw\'s income
replacement benefits are properly terminated effective the
first day of his employment in Alberta. However, for reasons
previously stated, for the period September 24, 1997 to the
date of termination pursuant to s. 129(1)(e) the court finds
that Sawkiw was entitled to be paid a full income
replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return
to work. SGI shall therefore pay to Sawkiw the difference,
if any, between the amount paid to Sawkiw for the period
September 24 to October 23, 1997 and the amount required to
be paid pursuant this judgment for the period September 24
to the date of Sawkiw\'s commencement of employment in
Alberta. Sawkiw shall also be entitled to interest on such
amount from the date such additional benefits should have
been paid until the date of this judgment. If
it is found that as a result of the accident, Sawkiw is
currently unable to hold the employment that he held at the
time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider Sawkiw\'s

The plaintiff had been injured in a motor vehicle accident and received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis that he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. After the accident, the plaintiff temporarily disabled himself and underwent physiotherapy at a physiotherapy clinic in Yorkton. He applied to SGI for an order setting aside the termination. HELD: SGI's termination was appropriate. SGI shall pay the plaintiff the difference, if any, between the amount paid to the plaintiff for the period September 24 to October 23, 1997 and the amount required to be paid pursuant to the judgment for September 24, 1998 and the date of the plaintiff returning to his pre-accident employment.  1)Sawkiw's benefits were terminated October 23/98 pursuant to ss.185(d), (e), (f) or (g) of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations. 2)The plaintiff was found to have a relapse under s. 142(1)(a) of The Personal Injury Protection Benefits Regulations as he was unable to perform certain farm duties and was required by SGI to attend physiotherapy sessions. 3)It was not clear how SGI expected the plaintiff to spend his time and energy in treatment and if he was entitled to interest on such an amount from the date such benefits should have been paid until the commencement date of his employment in Alberta.  4)SGI was not prepared to find that the plaintiff caused his early discharge from the Yorkton Physiotherapy Secondary Treatment Centre or failed, without valid reason, to attend his scheduled assessment at Wascana. The court found that SGI had prior knowledge the plaintiff was suffering from depression and it was not entitled to terminate the benefits. 5)Saskatchewan Government Insurance was awarded costs of preparing and filing notice of motion.",0.5770653514180025,5_1998canlii13955.txt,"An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits.

However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work.

The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it.

In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","The court refused to issue summonses to the defendant in an action for breach of a trust agreement. The defendant had submitted 18 claims for issuing to the court on behalf of the claimants. The judge had refused, on the grounds that the claims were frivolous, vexatious, or an abuse of the court's process.

The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month.

The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic.

The children were adequately provided for on the basis of his disability. The Federal Child Support Guidelines would stipulate a monthly payment of $442.00.

The claim for relief was grounded in the fact that the respondent was the registered owner of the farm land and he should receive half of the value of the land. The other half should be paid to the petitioner by monthly payments of $500. The Court awarded the balance of $6,000.00 to the respondent and $500 to the wife. The balance should go to the husband to meet his obligations which presently form part of his monthly expenses as set out in his financial statement. The husband's pension income was $3,086 which results in a shortfall of $1,111.67 if he is required to pay out an additional $500 month. The wife's expenses were inflated.

2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","The parties, who were together for seven years, were permanently separated. Now, the petitioner seeks access to their 11 year old daughter from an earlier relationship. The petitioner alleges that because he is a'step-parent' to the child, he does not need to establish that he falls within the category of persons having a'sufficient interest' to bring this application. HELD: 1) The petitioner has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of the child.  2) The respondent demonstrated that he was a person of sufficient interest with respect to the relationship with the petitioner. The relationship spanned the years 2000 to 2007, commencing when the petitioner was barely a toddler. Over the years the petitioner provided care for the petitioner, participated in activities with her and was involved in her two young children who were conceived while she was separated from the respondent. 3) It is pertinent to note that the respondent's record as a person with a sufficient interest speaks for itself. He was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment to be served in the community based sentence for assaulting the petitioner and threatening the mother with a knife. Separations and disruptions in the family were the norm. The respondent's criminal record acquired during the time he lived with the respondent speaks volumes about his ability to meet the needs of his children. 4) In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person With a sufficient Interest, the court should consider a variety of factors including the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, (c) how the relationship was represented to the world, whether the applicant provided financially for the child and the circumstances of the relationship between the parties. 5) In this case, the respondent demonstrated he is someone of sufficient interests. The Court cannot conclude that he lacks the means to establish a familial relationship with his child. The presumption that it is in the petitioner's best interests that she have access to him is of more consequence to the legal position that he has argued. Even though he may be considered a person who has demonstrated a settled intention to treat his own child as his own, that determination would not elevate him to status greater than that of person with sufficient interest under the Act.

Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate.

There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand to provide a sample of his breath by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to enable proper analysis of my breath to be made by means of an approved screening device. The accused argued that he was not intentionally trying to avoid providing an adequate sample. He was attempting to supply sample as directed by the officer. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The officer's lack of cander in giving his testimony in this regard has raised doubts in the mind as to his forthrightness in respect to other important details.  2)There was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused's evidence of the accused. The officer testified that he stopped the second test as the accused was blowing outside the mouthpiece of his vehicle. He said he waited for the ready light to come on. He got an imbalance signal from the machine. He stopped the test and blew three times in all. 3)The accused did not provide adequate instructions to the officer as to what to do with the sample or how to provide the appropriate instructions. There was no reason he could not provide the sample on a day that he did not have access to the machine and he had to blow the sample himself. 4)The mental element of the offence of refusal created by s.254(5) consists of intentional non-compliance. The police officer was aware that the accused had three beers the whole night. He slowed down and did not inform the accused of anything. He told the accused he would be charged with refusal when he was informed that he had been issued a notice to refuse the breath sample. 5)The Court accepted the accused’s evidence that he failed to provide adequate sample as he was unable to understand why things did not work on the night in question and that the officer was not able to understand how he was asked to provide such a sample. The Court was not satisfied that he provided adequate instructions as to when and where the sample should be provided.,"[1] Andre Detillieux stands charged that on or about the 11th day of November, 2001 at Paddockwood District in the Province of Saskatchewan did without reasonable excuse, fail to comply with a demand made to him by Cst.

The only reason he could not comply with the demand was because he was on patrol in the Paddockwood District and had no duties. The police vehicle approached from the rear and had to engage its emergency lights. The vehicle swerved to the right-hand side of the highway more than necessary as he approached it. He approached the vehicle once the officer engaged his emergency lights and his emergency breathing apparatus.
