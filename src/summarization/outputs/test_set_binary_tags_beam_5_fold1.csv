2003skqb487.txt,"At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support. HELD: Interim custody was given to the petitioner with access to the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month. On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo.","At issue on this application is the interim custody of the child of the petitioner and the respondent. The parties began to cohabit in 1998. In May 1999, the parties would'switch Keanna every second day' and that after that the respondent had access to every second weekend until November 2002 when the petitioner ended access. The respondent has had access. At issue is the status quo. The child has and does reside with the petitioner, with access and visitation arrangements to the respondent and a like amount on the first day of each month thereafter until further order. HELD: 1)The status quo was maintained with the respondent having access and the petitioner having reasonable access. 2)The petitioner admits that he loves Keanna and has exercised access to her on a fairly regular basis. Both parties have been willing to make arrangements in the past. Efforts have been made by the respondent to make the child feel comfortable, happy while at his home. There is plenty of affidavit evidence that the parties are loving parents to their child. The mutual love and acceptance demonstrated by the families and relatives of each party was self-evident and commendable. The petitioner shall have costs of her application.  3)Interim custody was ordered on the basis of the current status quo which was that the child had and had resided with both parents. The mother was to have regular access on a second weekend, every other weekend, reasonable telephone access and reasonable access during holiday periods. The father was to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month commencing December 1/2003 and $236 per month thereafter. There was plenty of affidavits of the parties and their family members and relatives confirming various access arrangements. 4)Both parents were ordered to complete the Parenting After Separation course. Both must file a certificate of completion once the course is completed."
2_2012nssc10.txt,"Rule 77.03 – Liability for costsThe court found in favor of the respondents after a half-day chambers hearing. They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim. Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two. This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing. While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs. The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner.","The applicants applied for solicitor client costs or in the alternative costs under Tariff 'C' to which they say a multiplier of four should be applied for a total of $12,000 costs plus disbursements of $302.75. The Bowsers were successful as Respondents in Chambers application which was heard for full day on October 18, and half day October 20, 2011. The application consumed 1 full day, and the morning of October 20 by ending at 10:45 a.m. The court calculated that the matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant amount of effort to prepare for, conduct the hearing and to review the evidence to be able to provide briefs to the court post hearing."
9_1990canlii2351.txt,28 year old male with 19 previous theft and property related convictions - broke into a vehicle and stole a computer - damaged motor vehicle  -  18 months for theft and 12 months concurrent for mischief upheld on appeal.,"Appellant, twenty-eight years old, pled guilty to two offences. The theft of a computer and modem exceeding $1,000.00 contrary to s.334(a) of the Criminal Code and mischief (s. 430(4) (a)) were his offences. He was sentenced to 18 months to be served concurrently with the theft charge. He appealed his sentence on the grounds the sentence was unfair and the mischief charge was too long. Allowing the appeal, that the sentence is too long and the offences are serious offences from which the public must be protected. The trial judge was correct when he said general deterrence must be a priority."
2007nspc30.txt,"Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction. The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground. The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib. The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence. Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge. The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assault with a weapon contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and possession of a weapon for the purpose of challenging the accused's authority to not come upon his property. The accused claimed that he struck the accused in self-defence. Absent consideration of defence evidence, the Crown evidence clearly establishes a prima facie case inasmuch as that evidence establishes that the accused intentionally struck and thereby applied force to the accused causing him to suffer wounds. The Court was unable to believe that the defence evidence could ever have thought that he was facing an imminent attack when the accused stepped toward the advancing defendant and that the knife would have been reasonable for the accused to make no motion to use the knife. The gesture of holding a knife and stepping forward could only reasonably have been seen as warning to come no further and to leave."
b_1996canlii7148.txt,"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident. The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued. An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.","A claim for damages for damages arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff had leased a vehicle from the defendant, Christian Ruhr, pursuant to a standard lease agreement. After the accident, the plaintiff took the vehicle to Saskatchewan Government Insurance for repairs. During the repairs, damage to the vehicle's exhaust system was assessed. SGI deducted from the replacement cost, 20% for depreciation or 'betterment'. The claim was adjourned for reimbursement of the $503.73 deducted for depreciation. HELD: An express election is not necessary. If the insurer wishes to reinstate, it must give the assured unequivocal notice that it intends to do so. In this case, SGI elected to repair the vehicle under statutory condition 8(4) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. 1)This is an election under an exclusive condition of the Act. The defendant took no notice of the alternative claim for reinstatement, but disputed the amount claimed and they prepared a minute of reference to arbitration on the question of damage. This minute was not signed as the defendants insisted upon all the other insurers being parties to the reference. 2)SGI did not expressly notify the plaintiff, nor Crestview, that they intend to exercise their option to rein reinstate. Crestview repaired the vehicle without informing the plaintiff. 3)If an insurer elects to repair, it will be liable for the entire cost of the repair. 4)An express election does not constitute an election. The Court would be reluctant to hold that an insurer exercised an election by conduct unless it was satisfied that the insurer had all the available information before him on which to decide which of the two courses was more advantageous to him. 5)A mere offer to settle by payment of a certain sum of money will probably not of itself be an election to pay if that offer is refused; insurers would be wise to state that any such offer was made without prejudice to their right to reinstatement. 6)The Court found that SGI's election to repair unilaterally creates a new contract between the insurer and the insured. The insurer may not unilaterally revoke the new contract to rein back."
d_2006skqb251.txt,"Hayley is 7 years old. In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her. The father seeks sole custody. The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests. The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access.","The father petitions for sole custody of his 7 year old daughter, while each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother independently seek joint custody with the father. Hayley's mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) Hayley is seven years old. The father resides with his father in Alberta. Each of the parties and their extended families have chosen to relocate from the City of Calgary. The Court has no other facts before it relating to the physical aspect of where Hayley might reside or go to school if she moves with her father to the city. 2) The mother testified that she and the father had agreed that she would be the homemaker for the foreseeable future. It is here that Hayley was conceived. She was conceived after they began to cohabitate with one another. She is now 16 years of age. The mother lives in a duplex located on the Air Force base. Their home is two and a half blocks from the nearest school. During this time they lived together for four and one-half years. Their hours of work are from 2:00 to 10:00 p.m. each week. During that time they often visited their father's apartment. This arrangement was temporary and eventually fell apart when the mother moved with her daughter to Alberta. 3) The father is currently residing in an apartment in Alberta with his parents. He is uncertain where he and his daughter may be residing in the future. His annual income is $60,000 per year. He plans to have his family move to Calgary in the summer so that he can have more time with his daughter. The parents have discussed the possibility of moving to Alberta so that she can have some time with her mother. If this is not done, the father will have to seek the assistance of the Nova Scotia courts. 4) The petitioner's mother and grandmother testified that they had discussed the prospect of moving with Hayley to Alberta during this time period. Their current circumstances are complicated by the fact that the petitioner has two older children and one brother who lives in Halifax. The petitioner has always been close to her parents. However, the petitioner's relationship with her grandmother has been more civil. She recently received a non-consent order which prohibits the removal of the petitioner from Nova Scotia without the written consent of her mother or an order of court of competent jurisdiction. In this case, the court has jurisdiction to grant this order pursuant to Nova Scotia s. 29 of 2005."

The father applied for an order pursuant to the Children's Law Act s.29(1)(a) finding the mother in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of the August 15, 2002 access order. He sought a fine and an order that she bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. He applied to vary the terms of the access order. The Court raised jurisdiction, service and time issues.HELD: 1)To avoid adjournment counsel consented to the court's jurisdiction, the acknowledgement of service and the abridgement of time. 2)The mother was found to be in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the order by repeatedly refusing, without lawful excuse, to comply with its terms. Almost without exception she refused to make the child available for the bi-weekly supervised access visits. She did not abduct the child. The mother was to purge her contempt by paying the father's solicitor and client costs respecting the two applications fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order. The August 15, 2002 order was vacated. 3)The father was to have unsupervised access on alternate weekends. He may bring the child to Saskatchewan but shall not remove her from this province or Manitoba without the mother's written consent. The father shall bear the costs of access with partial reimbursement in the amount of $60 per month, which may be deducted from ongoing child support. He shall give at least seven days notice if he is unable to exercise access. The mother shall have reasonable telephone access.","FIAT The father applied for an order pursuant to s. 29(1)(a) of The Children's Law Act finding the respondent in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of an August 2002 access order. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt and ordered to pay solicitor and client costs fixed at $1,500 and to supply the respondent with reasonable telephone access for the supervised access visits. The limited access proposal by the respondent was not realistic because it virtually guarantees that the petitioner and his parents will never be able to develop any relationship with his son, who the petitioner has been supporting financially on a voluntary basis since birth. Nor was the access proposal of the respondent realistic because the respondent did not have the financial ability to bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits as well as to have the child reach the petitioner by telephone. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent deliberately disobeyed the court order by repeatedly refusing without lawful excuse to comply with terms of the order. Almost without exception, she refused to make the child available for thevised access visits that were ordered every two weeks over a four-month period from August to December 2002. The petitioner was in contempt when she moved with the child without prior notice to the petitioner. The August 2002 order of Koch J. was vacated."
7_1994canlii4892.txt,"The wife petitioned and the husband counter-petitioned for a division of matrimonial property, custody, access and spousal and child support. HELD: 1)The matrimonial property was valued and divided equally. The wife was permitted to register a caveat to protect the value of her 1/2 interest. If the husband did not arrange payment by September 1st next, the wife was given leave to apply for a sale. 2)The wife was given custody of the 2 children of the marriage.  The court ordered specific access for the husband. 3)The court confirmed the interim support orders made before trial in the amounts of $400.00 per month for the wife, $400.00 per month for the oldest child, and $800.00 per month for the youngest child, who was handicapped.","The issues were custody and access, child and spousal support and division of the matrimonial property. The petitioner counter-petitioned in 1991. In 1992, Osborn granted interim maintenance in the amount of $400 per month. In 1993, Matheson, J. granted the same amount as in the interim order. In 1994, the Saskatchewan Teachers' Superannuation Commission transferred the sum of $3,887 to an RRSP as may be prescribed by the wife. An application by the husband to reduce the interim support was denied. HELD: 1)The beneficial interest created by the order of the court was sufficient to support registration of a caveat in the following lands to the extent of $50,711.66. 2)The respondent was not seeking custody of the children but required firm guidelines as to access. 3)An award for retroactive support and maintenance sought by the petitioner must be rejected.

2010skqb292.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats. The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content. The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content. In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany. When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation. HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality. The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff. There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff. The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company. The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs.","The plaintiff certified organic farmer sold organic oats to the defendant who in turn sold the oats through a broker in Ontario to the ultimate destination being a miller in Germany. The German miller rejected some of the oats as having a high moisture content and refused to pay the farmer. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to full payment of the contractual price.  1) The testimony before the court established that the contract as described above was validly entered into between the plaintiff and the defendant. The quality requirements of the contract had been met. There was nothing in the contract with Wlaswich that allowed the plaintiff to continue to accept risk of non-acceptance or non-payment from any third party.  2) The documents submitted by the defendant purportedly copies of the German documentation were not admitted into evidence.  3) The issue is of little relevance in coming to the final conclusion. The plaintiff is an organic farmer from the Kamsack region of Saskatchewan. He was aware that Bio Canada was reselling his oats. He had the necessary certificates of conformity required to be a certified organic Farmer in Canada, the United States and Europe. After that point in time, the resale of the grains to the German Miller was the responsibility of Bio Canada. It did not lead any evidence that the oat samples that they took from the other parties' shipments were tested and not found to comply with the contract.  4) The plaintiff has been awarded pre-judgment interest on the sum of $51,608 from September 2006 until the date of judgment."

The defendant entered the house in the night and assaulted the complainant when she returned to pick up some clothes. Imposing a sentence of two years eight months, plus a ten year firearm prohibition, that this offence could be categorized as a major sexual assault. The principles of sentencing and the impact on the victim, especially in view of the fact that she was his common-law spouse, made this sentence fit.","The accused was convicted, by a jury, of sexually assaulting his common-law spouse. The offence was contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused had separated from the common law wife a few days prior and had been seen by her children. She had called the accused late in the night prior to the offence and said that she did not care if she went to jail for this. HELD: A fit and proper sentence for the crime, taking into account the circumstances of this offence and the requirements of denunciation and general deterrence, was a sentence of two years and eight months, the total being thirty-two months.

d_2013skca22.txt,"The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable. The prospective appellant failed to establish that there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings or to the field of practice, the state of law or the administration of justice to warrant a determination by the Court.","The appellant seeks leave to appeal an order by the Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an Administrative Judge appointed pursuant to the Court Administration Protocol (CAP) established as part of the settlement of the Indian Residential Schools litigation. The parties are disputing MLG's obligations under the VA and each party has made an application to the Administrative Judge for directions to proceed to Step 2 of the verification process. The Administrative Judge found that both parties agreed that there was a need for one comprehensive database for the purpose of verifying the applicants' fees and disbursements. The applicant seeks to have the court find that the administrative judge exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring MLG to pay the disputed account of a non-party relating to matters wholly unconnected to the action. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The application is not allowed. The administrative judge made no error in finding that the parties agreed on a common database and that the process for reconciling the redacted electronic billing records as whole from the 'live data' for the residential schools litigation was not over. Both parties relied on hearsay evidence and an application for directions is simply an informal procedural step to ensure the Verification process moves along. Any allegations of delay by MLG are simply unfounded and in applying the test for the granting of leave, the Court of Appeal will consider them."

He did not commit any error.","The appellant pled guilty to a charge of fraud exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.

He failed to make the required financial disclosure and relied on a medical disability of which he gave no prior notice. The judge allowed the application to proceed, over the objections of the mother, and reduced the child support obligation to $1 per month. The mother appealed. Appeal allowed; the judge's decision to allow the application to proceed was procedurally unfair to the appellant and wrong in principle. Only in rare circumstances should a party applying to reduce child support be heard absent that party making full disclosure.","The mother appealed an order which, in response to an application by the father to vary a child maintenance order, reduced his child maintenance obligation to $1.00 per month. The father had never paid any child support voluntarily under the previous orders and was in default of the disclosure provision in Justice MacLellan's order. He applied to vary the maintenance order even though he had not made adequate disclosure of his financial situation. HELD: Appeal allowed in part; dismissal of the application without prejudice to his bringing a new variation application on proper material. The mother did not request costs. The court was told at the hearing that the father had filed an incomplete Statement of Financial Information (which was 10 months out of date) and that he could not afford the fee for them to file his return or to get his documents back. He presented no T-4 slips and incomplete income documentation for the 2002 and 2003 years; he also sought to rely on a medical disability of which he had given no previous notice.

The respondent sought an order directing the caveats be continued on the condition Home Oil commence an action within a reasonable time to determine their validity. At issue was whether the caveator or the challenger should be required to initiate an action.

The Chambers judge also accepted the respondent's submission that the extent of the immunity of administrative boards and their members from actions such as this based on their alleged malice and bad faith is, as yet, unclear in Canada. Allowing the appeal in part, that the Chambers judge erred when he concluded that all questions of law, including questions where the law is clear, should not be brought before the court in an application to strike, when he concluded that the constitutional question posed by the respondent had not yet been answered by the courts, and when he determined that the extent of the immunity of the appellant Board and its members, except for the Chair, was unclear.

The broader issue involves consideration of the immunity of the Labour Relations Board, and its members, from actions based on their alleged malice and bad faith. The appeal is allowed in part, per reasons for judgement of Pugsley, J.A., Hallett and Freeman, JJ.A. The issues in this appeal are whether the Chambers judge applied a Wrong Principle of Law, in that the issue of whether the respondent, in laying the information, was cloaked with Crown immunity, was unclear in law, and the desirability of maintaining supervisory jurisdiction over administrative tribunals by superior courts appeared to be an open question in Canadian law. The issue of Crown immunity in this case was not plain and obvious. It was more akin to a statutory defence to an action than an action."
c_2000canlii19597.txt,"The accused was charged with uttering threats to his 77 year old mother to cause death to her and his brothers contrary to s.264.1 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The words spoken by the accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously and implied menace to the listeners. The accused's evidence was disbelieved. His constructed story did not 'hang together'.  2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences. Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility. The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference.","The accused was charged with uttering a threat to cause death to his three children contrary to s. 264.1 of the Criminal Code. The accused had lived on a farm for 64 years and had a very bitter family fight. One of the children claimed that the accused had given him money to buy cattle. When the accused hung up the phone, the accused became very angry and his voice was so loud that he woke the baby granddaughter sleeping in the next room. The defence objected, arguing that the convictions were dated and highly prejudicial. HELD: The accused was found guilty of uttering the threat. The Court held that there was no need for the accused to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. It was always open to the Accused to make an application and have ruling on it before electing to call evidence. In a non-jury trial, the Court should look charily at admitting such convictions or giving them any probative weight whatever. There is no need to draw a prima facie inference from the criminal record during a trial such as this one. The Accused's record is properly explained and properly contextualized. With regard to his version of the conversation, no question was put to him as to whether he heard his grandmother say anything about the police attending or that she would shoot them."
9_1994canlii7210.txt,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building or facility, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village.  The defendants claimed the bylaws of the resort Village were inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under Sec. 15 of the Charter. HELD: The charges were dismissed. 1) The municipality did not deny that it had a boathouse on a public reserve in front of its cottage lot, and that it could not refuse or refuse to comply with the zoning bylaws for that use. However, the municipality took the position that the expense of maintaining the reserves was the responsibility of the municipality, despite the fact that it was the Province's titleholder. 2) The Municipality stepped into that position. Moreover, it could be argued that after the enactment of the interim zoning bylaw in 1986, permission from the province had to be obtained if their zoning Bylaws did apply in law to public reserves. 3) In some cases, however, cottage lots did not go to the high water mark as they did not want to be part of the private lot. 4) In others, if one wished to do anything on a reserve, as distinct from the foreshore, he had to have the permission of the Department of Municipal Affairs representing the government both as landowner and as enforcer of Sec. 197. 5) There were access walkways to such public reserves, between cottage lots, set aside on the plan of survey, unless one is familiar with the survey. One would not even be likely to realize that public reserve existed, let alone realize how to access it from the landside without trespassing on cottage lots. The real question was whether any given council chose to act out of respect for law, or pressures to enforce s. 197, or not."
b_1995canlii6134.txt,"The Plaintiff commenced these proceedings seeking to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff's condition related to 2 pre-existing injuries. The only issue which the Court was asked to resolve was whether this accident had caused or contributed to the Plaintiff's injuries. HELD: The question posed was answered in the affirmative. While a normal healthy person might not have been injured in this low speed rear-end collision, the Court was satisfied that, because of the Plaintiff's previous injuries and poor sitting position, the collision did contribute to her current condition in a modest manner.","The 46-year-old female plaintiff sought judgment for damages she suffered as a result of Mr. Rooke's negligent operation of the motor vehicle owned by Mr. Bird. All of the elements of the plaintiff's claim had been resolved with the exception as to whether her injuries were caused by the negligence of the driver. HELD: The Court answered the question as to the causation of the plaintiffs injuries and to what extent. Based on the medical opinions and clinical observations, the court concluded that the driver's back was uniformly supported by the seat of the vehicle and no part thereof could move against another part and thereby cause an injury of the kind that was noted by the plaintiff. The Court found that the collision did not have the potential to cause or contribute to any of the defendants injuries or damage.  1)The pain and suffering experienced by the female plaintiff relate to pre-existing conditions and to two mishaps that pre-date the collision. 2)The Court was unable to accept the expert's opinion as to how the pain in the lower back might have arisen from the collision because of the substantial change in acceleration caused by such a fall."
5_2014skpc78.txt,"Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","The accused was charged with sexual assault, creation of child pornography and invitation to sexual touching. The accused was alleged to have touched her in the nude while an adult took photographs of the occurrence. The search of the accused's computer was conducted immediately on the premises, and after returning the items to the justice, and without further authorization as is now required in R. v. Vu. The court found that the information to obtain the search warrant was sufficiently defective that it was invalid, thereby infringing s. 10(b) of the Charter and that evidence obtained should be excluded. There was also an allegation that the accused, who had been separated from her estranged husband and engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her son, was involved in sexual activity with the accused and that she had been asked to massage her breast and vagina while the adult took photos of the alleged offence. At no time did the accused state that she did not believe in the offence, but rather that there were pictures of her doing so. The Court concluded that the ITO was not a nullity and that the Court could not, in the form presented, support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially. The application of the Defence was voir dire, conducted at the request of the defence, to determine the validity of the search conducted pursuant to the warrant. HELD: The Court held that the Information to Obtain the Search Warrant (ITO) was valid and that it should have been issued. However, the omitted fact concerning the dispute of the parents and previous allegations against the accused was relevant as it could have led the Court to conclude that the search was done without authority concerned insufficiency of the Information To Obtain a search warrant (the ITO did not allege the commission of the offence nor was it alleged that the person who was the only source of information for that information was the one with the capacity to administer an oath). The Court found that given the detail of the documents to be searched, the omission of cellular telephones was intended, and the search of such items was not an unreasonable step in an investigation. Therefore, no prescriptive evidence could have been obtained by reason of a denial of rights, which is of significance in considering an appropriate remedy if a breach is established."
b_2003skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son. The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application. However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered. The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will. The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business. The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools. The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss. The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case.","The plaintiff claims that the mutual fund ought never to have formed part of his father's estate. His father's intention to name him as beneficiary was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendants are chartered life underwriter and financial consultant who sells life and investment products through Canada Life Assurance Company and Dataplan Securities Ltd. The plaintiff purchased an annuity life policy through Nordstrom for a lump sum premium of $60, naming Garry Mayer as its beneficiary. When the annuity matured in 1994, it was withdrawn by the plaintiff and deposited in his own bank. He shall have pre-judgment interest from the date of death of his son to March 31, 1996 for his costs to be taxed and his costs of the probate fees paid. The claim against Nordstrom is dismissed. Given that the plaintiff held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning, his completion of the beneficiary designation on the application could do nothing but cause confusion in the plaintiff's mind. Consequently the 'disappointed beneficiary' principle is equally applicable in this case involving financial planner and his client. Garry Mayer has cause of action as disappointed beneficiary and that he suffered damages as a result of Nordstrom's negligence. His claim for excess probate fee paid by the estate and the claim against it is dismissed as being a failure of the defendant to discharge its duty of care to him and consequently, his negligence."
b_2002skqb72.txt,"Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278. He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time. The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies. He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit. The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time. Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans. At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines. Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a). The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees. The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs. The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay. Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month. The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.  3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance. The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2). A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald. It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due. If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.","The parties sought to vary the existing child support order. They have two children, Luke, age 21 and Amanda, age 18. Under the terms of the order, the respondent was paying child support in the amount of $987 per month on the basis of an income of $80,278. The petitioner is working part-time and living at home with the children. Luke is 18 and attending university. He decided not to go to university that fall. He commenced full-time studies at the University of Regina in September. He continues to work part time. HELD: 1) Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, the Court of Appeal found that both Luke and Amanda are children of the marriage and are involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither is able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. 2) The respondent was awarded $1,153 per month as child support due for one child based upon his income. He has paid no child support since then. In the circumstances at hand, it would be appropriate to calculate arrears only for support of Luke during the months of September to December 2001. 3) The petitioner's income in 2000 and 2001 was expended on his own living expenses and any Part-time income that the children may have will reduce their entitlement to a living allowance under their student loans. The Table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post -secondary expenses not covered by student loans was $18,000 per annum. 4) While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied in an individual circumstance. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and the legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. To be inappropriate, the Table amount must 'exceed the generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement is possible'. It is not clearly excessive given the cost of maintaining the home for the children."" 5) In the circumstance at hand and the demonstrated ability of the children to obtain reasonably remunerative summertime employment that they are not dependent upon their parents during the summer months and have the ability to contribute adequately to their food, shelter and related expenses when not in attendance at school."
d_2010skqb349.txt,"The defendant applied for an order sealing the affidavits of two young people who were the victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted at a high school by senior students, including the plaintiffs. The defendant argued that public disclosure of the affidavits would exacerbate the harm that was done to the young people. The Leader-Post was granted leave to speak to the matter and opposed the application. HELD: Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine, particularly in an electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the young persons in their affidavits will not cause further harm to them. The public, including fellow students, have the right to know their version of the facts. However, other portions of the affidavits that refer to the effects of the assault on the young men and their ramifications to others should be sealed because there is a real risk of further harm to the young persons and to others.","The defendant applies for an order sealing the affidavits of two young persons. Counsel for the plaintiffs consent to the order. The defendant applies at the top of the range of protections which the court may afford to individuals in our society and the onus is on the applicant to establish on a continuing basis that this remedy is required. The young persons, JP and JR, now in Grade 9, were victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted by senior students, including the plaintiffs, and that public disclosure of information in their affidavits would exacerbate the harm which has been done to them. The assaults and related proceedings have already generated strong emotions on all sides. The plaintiffs have been the subject of negative comments on the social networking site Facebook. Based on my education and experience, I believe that further publicity of the allegations made by the children can only serve to aggravate the controversy and detract from the education and well-being of the student body as whole."
c_1998canlii14016.txt,"The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment and have the plaintiff's claim struck out. The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence. The defendants, carrying on business as a hauling sub-contractor to Tri-Link, reported a cheque drawn on the plaintiff bank as lost. Tri-Link issued a replacement cheque. The first cheque was certified at a bank branch of the plaintiff in Alberta and deposited to the defendants' credit union account. Default judgments were obtained in January/March 1997 against the defendants who now sought to have them set aside pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 346 and 173(a). The defendants claimed the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action as a certified cheque is irrevocable and as such any default judgment may be set aside ex debito justitiae, in which case delay in bringing the application is not factor. The plaintiff claims it has a cause of action in either conversion or mistake of fact/unjust enrichment. HELD: The defendants' motion was dismissed as the plaintiff's statement of claim adequately disclosed a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.  1)There are exceptions to the irrevocable nature of a certified cheque. The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of a certified cheque as payment did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants in this instance had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The cerified cheque did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants had already received payment for their services.  2)In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of the payee is maintained while providing recourse to a bank where a payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a certified cheque.","The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment entered by the plaintiff against them and have the plaintiff's claim struck out. The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence. The present case is one of those situations where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of certified cheque, where payment does not satisfy just debt. The defendant had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The plaintiff had already received payment for their services. In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of the payee is maintained while providing recourse to a bank where payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a certificated cheque. HELD: The defendants motion must be dismissed. The plaintiffs statement of claim adequately discloses a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment. It is the accepted authority explaining the obligations of a bank to its customer and its redress against a cheque of cheque who appears to be taking advantage of an innocent mistake on the part of bank employee. It was the result in Barclays Bank v. Simms that payee in Canada seeks to avoid by having the cheque certified. As the plaintiff relies upon the principles in issue regarding the right of recovery of bank from cheque to cheque and as such, it can only be held accountable to innocent third parties and codified the consequences of certification. The claim cannot be defeated on that ground. Relief is sought pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 346 and 173(a). The court must assume that the defendants affirms that the principles are inapplicable when a certified checeque is involved. In this case, the plaintiff has established that a bank can charge fee to payee for representing that the drawer's cheque is valid and not be held to that representation simpliciter. The court may also look at the Notice of Motion, the attached Statement of claim and any document which is referred to in the Statement of Claim upon which the plaintiff must rely for the establishment of the claim. It seems to me that it is this result in the defendants' action in Nova Scotia that the plaintiff seeks to maintain such a claim."

Allowing the appeal, that although the panel's findings of fact were well within the jurisdiction of the disciplinary board, they did not constitute patently unreasonable interference by the appellant's defence to the charge.

d_2006skqb35.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.","The plaintiffs apply pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules (QBR) for an order compelling the defendant to respond to written interrogatories; an order permitting further oral examination for discovery of the defendant on issues arising from his responses to the written questions; and an order directing him to provide a copy of the report of neurologist Dr. Vrbancic to counsel for the plaintiffs. The issue is whether the plaintiffs have a cause of action for aggravated and punitive damages. HELD: The application is adjourned sine die. A number of applications have been brought in relation to the plaintiff and her children. In addition to pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages, each plaintiff claims aggravated damages and punitive or exemplary damages. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The court will determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation the plaintiff's skills, technique, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to reply to undertakings made by the defendant regarding their care and treatment of the plaintiff. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. The jurisprudence in medical malpractice cases does not favour granting aggravated and negative damages. However, special circumstances exist permitting further examination."
e_2008skqb192.txt,"FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial. The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order. HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children. The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order.","FIAT: The first access issue was for an order that would enable the petitioner to exercise increased access to the two young children born of his relationship with the respondent. The second time access was for two weeks followed by one week off. The fiat did not address access for the Christmas, 2007 period or the 2008 summer holiday period. Granting specific access for holiday periods in the distant future acts as a disincentive for the parties to resolve matters within a reasonable time period. HELD: 1) Applications to alter interim access orders are not the answer. Moving the matter quickly to pre-trial is not the way to go. 2) The court found no evidence of any material change in circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access. The schedule as detailed by Ryan-Froslie J. was not an extrapolation of the previous order. It was reasonable that during this period, his contact with the children should be increased. 3) The regular accessschedule as detailed was unchanged."
c_2014skqb31.txt,"Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it. The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants. SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance. The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation. The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs. Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured. The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success. The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material. The improper material included information on settlement discussions.","FIAT: The real issue in this application is whether Saskatchewan Mutual Insurance Company (SMI) was in a special relationship of insurer with the plaintiffs that carried a duty of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiffs are policy holders of SMI's policy of insurance. This policy is not an issue in the action commenced by the plaintiffs and is not relied on for coverage in respect of the claim. HELD: 1) There is at least one type of case of breach of contract where the arguments in favour of punitive damages are compelling. This is the case where the defendant breaches the contract deliberately, and refuses or fails to tender compensation known to be owing to the plaintiff. That position is untenable. The obligations created in this case are by SMI to the first defendants, the holders of the policy that provides coverage for the claim, and it is entitled to seek damages against those defendants for any amount up to and including the policy limits where the claim justifies such settlement. 2) In every insurance contract an insurer has an implied obligation to deal with the claims of its insureds and to ensure that the plaintiffs get a fair value in settlement of their claim. 3) An application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) could be made in any fashion that would permit the Court to impose a punitive damages award on a claim arising under that policy."

After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view. The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence. Regarding the impaired driving charge, the accused was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with breach of s. 8 of the Charter by failing to provide a sample of her breath to enable analysis to be made by means of an approved screening device. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count one. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge’s conclusions that the police officer was attending to conduct a search for evidence following Evans, 1996 CanLII 248. The police officer exceeded the authority conferred by the implied licence to knock. The court found that the officer did not knock on the door for the purpose of securing evidence for a crime, but rather because she was concerned that perhaps this person was out driving around with a young child in the backseat. The officer observed the accused walking around the house with the child to keep contact with her and watch her. The observations by the officer were very similar to that of the accused in that she engaged in a warrantless search that was without justification as it was with respect to a dwelling house.

HELD: 1) The Court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether to grant an application for severance.  In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.  2) The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than 1 day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or Dumurs. It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them.

The relationship between the two shareholders broke down and in November 1997, after the application of Mr. Morrison, the company was liquidated. Thereafter, Mr. Walbaum carried on business as the sole shareholder of the defendant company. The defendants deny any involvement in the divestiture of the company or in the dispute between Morrison and Walbaum.

Other options are available to ensure that all issues are tried in a manner that minimizes unnecessary prejudice and expense to all parties. 3) Although counsel for the plaintiffs asserts that the evidence against all of the defendants can be adduced, there are a number of groups that could be considered as a proxy for the applicants. Specific groups of applicants may pertain to the evidence to be called against one, two or all three of them. 4) The defendants will designate no more than two days during which the plaintiffs will adduce evidence in relation to each claim. The days to be designated by the plaintiffs for calling evidence shall be subject to the court's approval. 5) It will be left to the pre-trial management judge to designate specific days on which the applicants may call evidence. 6) The plaintiffs will not be relieved of their claims for pecuniary losses. 7) Specific groupings may be ordered. 8) The applicants are directed not to participate in any portion of the litigation that will require them to attend.

b_1995canlii5809.txt,"FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee. The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer. The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction. The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination. The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'. The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay. HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable. If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness. 3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise. The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness. 4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule. The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct. 5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.","FIAT.

The penalty imposed was a suspension without pay for 16 months.

d_2006skpc95.txt,"The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","The accused was convicted of aggravated assault for wounding his estranged wife. The Crown applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. The defence took the position that the accused should be designated a long-term offender. HELD: The Court held that the Court must now also consider whether the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that the offender is 'dangerous offender' and must be sentenced to indeterminate detention. A. Summary judgment issued on three cases involving Part XXIV of the Code in 2004. The Court reviewed the history of the offences and found that the predicate offence was an extremely brutal aggravated assault. The accused had stomped on the victim's head, stomach and kicked him in the back and was found lying in a bed with the sheets pulled up to his face. Other convictions included robbery, which involved stabbing the victim in the thigh and assault with a baseball bat. A new designation was created in the 1997 amendments which set out the requirements of the dangerous offender legislation and set aside the other offences. A dangerous offender designation was set aside and a pre-sentence report was submitted. The offender was found to be a threat to the life, safety and physical or mental well-being of other persons because of his pattern of repetitive behaviour and his ability to control his behaviour. Although he had been a law-abiding citizen for much of his adult life, the accused had been subject to various court orders to take substance abuse treatment and anger management or domestic violence treatment and had failed to show that the specific offender can be treated within a definite period of time. This is especially true in borderline cases."
2_2009skqb516.txt,"In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals. In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue. It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH. The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of the Agricultural Implements Regulations. While direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in the auction documents. HELD: 1) The issues relate only to the interpretation of the respective priority agreements between TD and the CNH Corp. and to the corporate policy of CNH Canada to refuse to restock direct ship inventory. 2) There is no basis to contend that the kinds of articles involved were in any way unique. Indeed, they were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers. 3) Notwithstanding the possibility of a contrary contractual provision, the agreement was not the same as the Receiver seeking to change the priorities as between the respective claimants. There was nothing special about the product, about the dealer's use of it, or about the ability of Wheatland or any other dealer to sell the product to retail customers in the normal course of business. The only link between Wheatland and the third party supplier was that the supplier would deliver the product directly to the respondent rather than first delivering it to Case or New Holland for shipment to Wheatland.  4) The contractual provisions clearly entitle CNH to refuse the restocking of direct ship components. The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by the respondent and inventory/credit financed by the NHCC that Wheatland has not paid for.

The issue does not end there.

9_1999canlii1682.txt,"The deceased was killed in a single car accident in 1972, leaving his wife, the plaintiff, who was pregnant with the second plaintiff, his daughter, as his survivors. In 1997, the plaintiffs first learned through other family members that the defendant, a nephew of the deceased, had revealed to them that it was actually he who was the driver of the car at the time of the accident. They brought an action under the provisions of the Fatal Injuries Act. This was an application to disallow the limitation defence raised by Judgment Recovery on behalf of the defendant. Dismissing the application without costs, that the limitation as prescribed by the Act is twelve months, which the plaintiffs had clearly exceeded. This time period is without regard to the injured party's knowledge of whether or not a claim exists.","This was an application by the plaintiffs, now residents of Alberta, for an order disallowing the limitation defence raised by Judgment Recovery on behalf of the defendant, Howard LeLacheur, pursuant to s. 10 of the Fatal Injuries Act. The action arose out of a single car accident 25 years earlier in which the defendant's uncle was killed. He was alleged to have been the driver. When the action was commenced, it was commenced some 25 years later. The plaintiffs argued that they were entitled to rely on the discoverability rule coupled with the fraudulent concealment rule so that the limitation period should not begin to run until February 1997, the date upon which they learned for the first time that Howard was the driver of the vehicle at the time of the fatality. In the peculiar circumstances of this case, the plaintiffs declined to award costs to Judgment Recovery. Judgment Recovery argued that the discovery examination evidence did not show that the defendant had attempted to conceal the identity of the deceased person for 25 years. The plaintiff testified that she had first been aware of the uncle's identity in 1972, when she was 12 years old. She had then made no inquiries to the police or the police as to how the accident happened, nor did she make any enquiries about the accident itself. She could have asked the defendant if he was related to the deceased, but for some reason did not do so. When time runs from the 'accrual of the cause of action' or from some other event which can be construed as occurring only when the injured party has knowledge of the injuries sustained, the discovery evidence fails to offer a sufficient evidentiary basis upon which this Court can make a finding of fraud concealment."
c_1998canlii13533.txt,"FIAT. An application to vary maintenance for two children under the Federal Child Supprt Guidelines. At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d). The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields. He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October. He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work. The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated. HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month. 1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income. The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997. Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past. No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded. In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable. The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck. The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children. His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute. Leave was given to return the matter to the Court with the appropriate supporting materials.  3)No order as to costs.","FIAT. An application to vary maintenance under the Federal Child Support Guidelines in respect of two children. The father had been employed at the Esterhazy potash mine on a full-time basis since May 1997. The preceding years were not significant because the father's current employment at the mine commenced in 1997. HELD: 1)The father's 1998 farm income was determined as being $27,600. The Table amount for two children on a gross annual income of $24,370 is $347 per. 2)The most reliable indicator of true income is the 1998 year because of the significantly higher amount he earned. Income should be determined by projecting his income at straight wages until October 15, 1998 thereby giving recognition to the possibility of lay-off and the reduction in overtime. The acquisition of equipment and the claiming of capital cost disallowance in these circumstances in lieu of renting equipment was not patently unreasonable. 3)The costs of the step-child's pet were refused. 4)The court was not prepared to consider a deduction for child support."
c_2013skpc94.txt,"A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs. The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children. They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated. The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access. The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister. HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b). The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister. The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.","The agency applied for a long term order under s.37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act (the Act) but amended its application to now apply for an order that the current foster parents be declared as persons having a sufficient interest in all three children (under s.23 of the Act and s.35(1)(b)) and an order granting them custody. The children are identified by initials for the purposes of protecting their identity. HELD: 1)Each child is in need of protection pursuant to s.11(b). As the first option, that of returning the children to their parent, is unavailable, the question is whether or not a placement with the proposed persons of sufficient interest would be preferable to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. The current plan proposed by the agency is for each child to remain where they are on a temporary basis; better that they have the added stability of the order being sought. The revised plan is appropriate in these circumstances. The Agency is addressing the concerns of the parents, who fear that the father will not be able to care for the children. 2)It is important that the children continue to have a sense of security in their placement, and continuity in their lives, both of which they will have if they remain in their current placement. The Father has agreed to a long-term order agreeing with the children that they should be placed in the custody of the Min. pursuant to ss.37 and 37(3), and that he shall have reasonable access on reasonable notice to each of his children within 15 days of receipt of it."

In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month. The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive. HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.  1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court. In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2) The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met. If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3) By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him. The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her. There was no justification for the payment to continue. It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.","FIAT: The respondent applies to vary his February 28, 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 1, 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for August 2004. This Court made an order fixing the parties' incomes and providing for ongoing support of $129 per month. It also terminated the respondent's payments for Brett. HELD: 1) The Court must do so keeping in mind the objectives set out in the Guidelines. Whether these orders should be made retroactive was reserved. 2) There is no presumption in favour of retroactive support. Parliament has left this for judicial determination. 3) This Court prefers the approach taken by the British Columbia Court of Appeal, which took the position that if Parliament could have made a policy choice, it would not have done so. Retroactive support orders often create debt that may affect the payor's ability to meet his ongoing obligations to the children covered by the order but may also adversely affect their ability to provide for other children in their care."
2_2010skqb444.txt,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marihuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and possession of stolen property. He applied for an order excluding evidence of cocaine found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were violated. This decision follows voir dire held to determine the admissibility of the evidence. HELD: The evidence must be excluded. 1) The accused was unusually nervous. He asserted that he was breathing rapidly and that his 'carotid artery' was 'pulsating' and he was concerned that the driver might have been drinking. The officers observed fresh black caulking around the external panels and at the front corners of both sides of the motor home. The accused's right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure under s. 10(b) was infringed when he was detained for an offence under the CDSA before the deployment of the drug sniffer dog. 2) There were a number of incidents during which the accused was subject to unreasonable search and seizure. The police observed a motor home be extensively modified to facilitate the transportation of illegal drugs. The plumbing and holding tank systems had been disabled, walls had been moved and secret compartments created, and hydraulics with switching system had been installed to provide access to the compartments. The vehicle contained 262 pounds of marijuana (worth approximately $733,000) in heat sealed plastic bags and two bundles of $20 bills that represented $3,080 to the accused. He asked if the engine had been replaced and if so, if there was anything that would assist in identifying the true identity of the vehicle. The officer told the accused that he had not looked at the license and registration that had been produced by the accused and that he did not use his video camera because it caused fuses to short out; the accused responded that he understood and stated that he wanted to speak to lawyer. He did not ask the accused if he had any more documents on him that he could obtain through the BC License Bureau or through the INC.VEH.VIN to confirm 'true identity' and that there were no other occupants and no visible luggage or other items in the vehicle that the accused may have been hauling contraband. 3) The evidence was excluded from the evidence because the accused's rights as a driver and as a passenger were not infringed under the Charter."

He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA. MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy. The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary. They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb.

Therefore the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for the surgery. 2)The exclusionary clause did not exempt MSI from liability for payment. The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation under the policy to extend the benefits in question.

HELD: The plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for surgery as a condition pre-existing the effective date of the policy.  1)The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation to pay. 2)The medical evidence showed that the surgery was medically necessary to perform since the plaintiff was firstly symptomatic with pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea on exertion and secondly, at risk of developing tension pneumothorax if subjected to air transportation. Delaying the surgery until the patient returned to Canada could place the plaintiff's life in jeopardy and not be standard of care for treatment of recurrent pneumothorrax. 3)The Court reviewed the medical evidence filed by MSI expressing views contrary to those of Dr. Adams. Accepting the evidence of the attending physician that travel was dangerous and put Hurd in jeopardy, the Court found that Hurd was Unable to Return To Saskatchewan For Surgery. 4)The plaintiff will have judgment for $26,864.46 prayed for in this action together with costs to be taxed."

HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittals ordered by the trial judge were restored. There was no basis to overturn the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The appeal judge misinterpreted the decision of the trial judge who properly considered the issue of income before dealing with mens rea. The evidence of taxability was not clear-cut, obvious or indisputable.","This was a summary conviction appeal by both accused from a decision of a Summary Conviction Appeal Court Judge ordering a new trial on seven counts against the appellants under ss. 239(1)(a) and (d) of the Income Tax Act. The charges against both accused relate to willfully evading the payment of taxes and the unlawfully making of a false or deceptive statement in the return of income. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittals ordered by the trial judge were restored. 1) The trial judge misinterpreted the decision. He proceeded on the worst case scenario that is that all payments received by the appellantants constituted income and then he considered the issue of criminal intent. Thus, there is some question as to whether either accused willfully evaded the payment, or whether there was any intent to make a statement knowing it to be false, deceptive. The bookkeeping was haphazard and sloppy. 2) Both parties agreed the test is set out in R. v. Redpath Industries Ltd. et al.

The Crown argued the accounting records upon which the claim for deductions were made were, in fact, false, false thus obviating the liability for tax. The defence argued the courts below erred in failing to recognize the falsity of the claims and in focussing only on the criminal intent of the accused.

2008skqb287.txt,"The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.","The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned 18 years.

The mother took the position that the children are not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to S. 11 of the Act and that they should be immediately returned to her care. 2) The Minister called 18 witnesses including one expert witness. The expert witness testified that S.T. was involved in a relationship with another woman and the mother was hostile to workers from the Ministry. She advised the mother that she did not want the children to be exposed to harmful interaction for sexual purpose. The child had severe lice. 3) The mother was to have access with the children for three times per week for four hours for a minimum of four hours. The parents would then have to attend anger management and parenting classes, allow parent aid into their home, work cooperatively with the Minister and ensure all of the children's medical needs were being met. The father did not attend trial because he was ill. 4) The evidence from the child protection worker was inadequate to consider the best interests of the child. The court referred to the mother's previous relationships with men and noted that the mother had changed as a result of her relationship with the man."

This was insufficient to displace a party's inherent right to attend his co-party's discovery.","This was an application concerning an action taken as result of a motor vehicle accident where the deceased was alleged to have been struck and killed by a pedestrian. The plaintiffs brought an application for exclusion of the defendant's grandchildren. Dismissing the application, that the evidence fell short of showing that there would be a violation of an essential of justice if the parties were not excluded from hearing the evidence of each other. The inherent rights of the parties to attend the discovery should not be displaced by the mere assertion that 'the lines of questioning of each of the plaintiff's grandchildren will be virtually identical'. There is no evidence before this court that that would be of value to the grandchildren in being able to participate in the discovery process."
7_1995canlii6153.txt,"The Plaintiff sued her stepfather for damages for sexual assault. He had previously been convicted of a criminal charge based upon the same incident. He did not defend the civil proceedings and the Plaintiff applied to have her damages assessed. The evidence in the civil trial also disclosed that the Plaintiff had be sexually assaulted by her uncle. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff. 1)The Plaintiff had been diagnosed as suffering from severe psychological problems as a result of the sexual assaults. 2)The Court assessed the Plaintiff's non-pecuniary damages at $50,000.00 and apportioned 80% of this sum or $40,000.00 to the step-father. 3)The Plaintiff was also awarded $25,000.00 in punitive damages as against the stepfather.","The defendant was the step-father of the plaintiff. He plead guilty to a criminal charge of sexually assaulting her. He was sentenced to ten months imprisonment. The plaintiff commenced an action against him claiming damages as a result of the sexual assaults. The defendant did not defend the action. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for damages was dismissed. 1)The functional approach should be utilized assessing the compensation required to provide the injured person with reasonable solace for his misfortune. Damages must be assessed primarily with respect to her non-pecuniary loss. 2)The psychological trauma and emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was severe. She would continue to suffer to the same extent for an appreciable period of time. 3)The Court found that the discrepancies between the amounts awarded by various courts in sexual assault cases could not be readily reconciled. Many awards did not reflect any appreciable degree of comprehension of the extent of the damage incurred by the victim. The psychological trauma which she had undergone had been severe. Her loss was already assessed as severe and there was likelihood that it may be chronic. Thus, she was entitled to an award toward the upper limit of the established range."
c_2007skpc41.txt,"The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification? HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later. At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief. Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer. As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 89(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The driving occurred when the accused was involved in a motor vehicle accident and engaged in other alleged misconduct, including driving without due care and consideration for others and failing to identify himself to the other driver before departing from the scene. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court applied the principles in McKenzie (P.N.) (R. v. Kraftchick) to the accused and found that the evidence of credibility was not left in reasonable doubt by it. The accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. The Court was still of the view that the accused's liberty was jeopardized with the potential of incarceration."
7_1999canlii3285.txt,"The plaintiff was injured as a result of a motor vehicle accident. The defendant was found liable. At issue was the claim of the plaintiff against the defendant's insurer for Section B benefits. The defendant paid benefits for 129 weeks. It claimed that the plaintiff misrepresented her employment status at the time of the accident, and that the benefits should be re-paid. The plaintiff argued in response that the defendant was estopped from claiming repayment. Ordering the benefits be re-paid, that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation, on the basis of representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it. It would be illogical to prevent the defendant from getting its money back when it is found that the benefits were paid on the basis of faulty information provided by the plaintiff. This is not a situation in which estoppel lies against the defendant.","The common law wife of the insured was injured when her car was hit from behind by a vehicle driven by the insured. The insurance company, Guardian, brought an action against the plaintiff pursuant to Schedule 'B' of the Paris insurance policy. The plaintiff's claim against the insurer was brought on the basis of her failure to indicate any interest in claiming repayment of the monies paid under the policy that had been paid to the insured prior to the accident. The defendant argued that, since the insurance company had refused to accept the plaintiff's evidence as to employment at the time of the accident, it was not open to the plaintiff to accept its money. Awarding the plaintiff $140 for loss of income for 129 weeks, that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation and to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it. It would be illogical to prevent the plaintiff from getting its money back.

d_2004nsfc13.txt,"The mother was unable to care for the child and the father, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was only entitled to supervised access. Both the paternal and maternal grandmothers presented plans of care to the court, with the paternal grandmother seeking custody and the maternal grandmother seeking care and control of the child. The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother. The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody. The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them.","The mother, who lives with the maternal grandmother, is a convicted child abuser whose name appears on the Child Abuse Register, having been sentenced to thirty-nine months in prison as a result of a conviction for child abuse. Although the mother is more connected to the child and has taken more interest in the long term care, she is more financially stable. Both parties were very uncooperative with the agency and it was clear neither was willing to work with assistance towards learning sufficient parenting skills to take care of the child. HELD: 1) Considering all the evidence before the court, including the two plans of care, there is a bond between the paternal grandmother and the child; she would facilitate access and protect the child from her own son whose access must always be supervised. She is better set up in her home to receive the child (age, health, death) than she is for her sister. The maternal grandmother indicated that she would have to move to a larger residence if she got custody. 2) Both parents do not have the ability to successfully parent D without there being sufficient risks to her healthy development. It is due to this that the Court makes the sole recommendation that D. is a child in need of protection who would ideally be placed for adoption. The child is in the best interests of both parties and there is no evidence that this should be elevated to a principle or rule of law. Both parents have demonstrated that their proposed plan is viable, well motivated and worthy of serious consideration."
3_1999canlii2586.txt,"One of the residual legatees of the respondent estate filed a petition under s. 31(1) of the Probate Act. At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.' The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act. The executor appealed. He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding. This was also one of those rare occasions where solicitor and client costs on the appeal were warranted, as the executor's actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which the Court termed reprehensible and unconscionable.","This appeal involves consideration of s. 31(1) of the Probate Act, C. 359 R.S.N.S.(1989) and a request from both counsel for the respondents that the appeal be dismissed with costs to be awarded on a solicitor and client basis. HELD: The appeal is dismissed as a matter of costs respecting the hearing before Justice Carver, for the determination of Feeney. The grounds of appeal are without merit, indeed, without any modicum of merit. The appeal was brought for the sole purpose of delaying the legatees from pursuing their legitimate rights. As such, this proceeding is an abuse of the appeal process.  1)Solicitor and client costs are only awarded in this jurisdiction in rare and exceptional circumstances. 2)The appeal is relevant to consider the matters that gave rise to the appeal. Mr. Saunders' actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which we would class as unconscionable. Those actions go beyond what we might term as merely reprehensible. 3)The Court found no error of law, or principle, with respect to the issues before him and found that his order to reimburse the estate with the money he had taken in September, 1997 and 1998 constituted a flagrant breach of fiduciary obligations owed by him as executor of the estate."

The landlord's appeal relates to findings of fact made by the hearing officer. There was evidence to support the hearing officer's factual decision and all of her findings.

d_2013skpc206.txt,"HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","The plaintiff puts forward that he loaned $5,000 to the defendants, with an additional $1,000 being paid to the plaintiff. The defendant, who was on salary, was unhappy about being asked to work less hours by her doctor and one of the reasons she was dismissed was because she was not able to qualify for special benefits due to her not having 600 hours of insurable employment. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is adjourned to a date to be determined by the parties and the Court.  1) The amount of damages is not known at this time and as the defendant may be able to now qualify and receive funds retroactively for the special benefits from Service Canada. There is no evidence to support the plaintiff's allegation that the payments were not consented to and agreed to by the defendant. 2) The defendant claims back $2,400 from the corporate plaintiff, the corporation, the defendant Lilia.  3) Lilia's statement of employment as prepared by the plaintiff is inaccurate and there is no record of it as far as loan documentation goes. The accounting records do not show it as a repayment of the advance.  4) The plaintiff could have obtained the payments that she lost by virtue of the defendant's inaccurate Record of Employment. If she was unable to obtain the payments, the Court will hear evidence and argument on the quantum of damages to be paid by her to the defendant, Lilia Turcan.  5) As there was no evidence that Lilia ever asked anyone else to pay back for expenses incurred by her in Greece, it would not be out of the ordinary for the defendant to provide them a gift to start their new life in Canada.  6) The defendants had the free use of their home, their cars and the plaintiff signed the cheque and gave it back.  7) It may be that there are no damages if she now qualifies for payment from service Canada. It would be a mixed success if she could obtain the funds that she had lost.  8) There was no agreement as to when Lilia was asked to sign the Statement of Claim, what she signed and signed, which one would anticipate considering a plaintiff is a corporation.  9) The statements of claim filed by Lilia are not filed as exhibits. The plaintiff filed a demand letter close to the time of issuing the statement of claim, but no document of it was ever received.  10) The Court was not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the $5k000 was a loan as there"
4_2004skqb280.txt,"This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","FIAT: This is an application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act (I-10.03) by Ms. [V.G.B.] for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: 1) The parties never lived together but had an intimate relationship which resulted in the birth of a child. 2) The child support order was set at a rate higher than the Table amount based on undue hardship. The onus is on the applicant to establish that any continued unemployment is unintentional or, if intentional, that it is reasonable in the circumstances and does not warrant the imputation of income. As the child of a previous relationship had been unemployed for several months, the child's current income is below the amount normally required for Table support. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education was 'unreasonable'. 3) The evidence does not support a finding of intentional unemployment. The child's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment and his ability to publish a newsletter for a period of 2 weeks will represent his total earnings to date in 2004. Other than that contract, he has been actively working towards obtaining a position with the provincial government. 4) Section expenses were not imputed."
b_2010skqb311.txt,"The accused was charged with having aftermarket tint on the side windows of his vehicle. He appealed on other grounds. The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion. The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations. HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established. Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty. The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations. The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio. The conviction was quashed.","The appellant appealed his conviction and sentence for 'unlawfully have sunscreen in front side windows' contrary to's.66(3) the Vehicle Equipment Regulations (Reg 10)'. The charge, as drafted, was so palpably bad it did not give fair notice to the defendant of the nature of the charge nor the penalties that may be imposed if a breach was established. The appeal was allowed and the conviction declared void because the charge did not charge an offence known to law. The Court invited both the Crown and the appellant to address the issue of the sufficiency of s. 275(2)(c) of the Code, and found that it was not possible to amend the count so as to cure the defect. An appeal of conviction should not be allowed because the count is a nullity and the nullity is not capable of amendment. A conviction based upon defective information ought not be found to be nullity. The Crown should have taken steps to correct the statute and regulations which oversimplified the offence. However, the Court found that this did not happen because the Crown did not provide proper notice or a meritorious basis to disturb the conviction entered or the fine imposed. HELD: Appeal allowed. The conviction was quashed. 1)The Court found it could not find a proper remedy on the part of the Court that would permit the Court to remedy the problem by simply changing the count to nullity or by adding an amendment to the count. It would be improper and unfair to the Crown to deprive the defence of a defence which had stood by and allowed the defence to proceed unimpeded. The Certificate of offence, form prescribed by Form of the Summary Offences Procedure Regulations, 1991, allows the applicant to designate, by ticking off the appropriate box, the Act or Regulation which is alleged to have been breached. 2)The Certificate of Appeal does not allege an offence because although it purports to prohibit the use of certain tinted windows, it does not provide that the contravention of the prohibition is an offence that carries with it penalty. It is prohibition, without the creation of an offence or imposition of penalty."
b_2012skqb350.txt,"The applicant wife sought an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. The consent judgment provided that the husband should make an equalization payment of $105,000 to be composed of cash and/or a rollover of retirement funds. The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax. Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000. The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value. The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application. The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs. Therefore, the Court ordered that the judgment be satisfied by way of rollover of RRSPs in the amount of $111,600.","FIAT: The wife seeks an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. HELD: 1) The consent judgment is to be interpreted in the same manner as an agreement. Negotiations are not relevant. The fact it was not specifically spelled out in the judgment is not fatal. Recognition of a discount for tax on RRSPs was explicit in the wife's position in her pre-trial calculations, and in all valuations of property discussed thereafter. The wife having laid out discounted values, one would expect that the husband would have demanded explicit language if he wanted to use unreduced RRSP values to satisfy the Equalization payment. To entertain the husband's proposition would be to construe the judgment in an unnatural sense in all the circumstances. This is irrelevant in light of the taxable nature of the RRSP funds. 2) The wife's application was directed to the Court of Appeal. The Court ordered that the amount transferred should be increased by a factor of 1.3. The court must examine the context in which the order was issued, evaluate the order in accordance with the circumstances of the case, and question whether the acts or omissions could reasonably have been contemplated to fall under the terms of the order."

Application dismissed; the evidence would not be so complex and scientific that the plaintiff's substantive right to a jury trial should be denied. Although the medical charts exceeded 1500 pages, the more relevant hospital records were less than 100 pages; the essence of the liability issue would be limited in time, in the most relevant anatomical area and in the number of medical personnel involved in the relevant interventions; the factual material did not appear to be in dispute; and the issues were no more complex than most causation issues presented in medical malpractice cases.","The plaintiff, who had been injured in a motor vehicle accident, applied under s.34(a)(ii) of the Judicature Act to set aside the jury notice filed by the defendants. The plaintiff's claim was based on the medical evidence of a doctor who had treated him at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital who had died shortly after the plaintiff's treatment. The medical evidence consisted of 15 pages of analysis of pre-injury personal profile, summary of diagnosis and treatment, and written opinion by a consultant in rehabilitation and cost of future care. The expert evidence was of such complexity and volume that it should be assessed by a judge and not a jury."
e_1992canlii2542.txt,"This was an appeal of a decision declaring that the respondent was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant. Dismissing the appeal, that the insurer of a subcontractor on a construction project was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss by the insurer of the principle contractor where the risk was allocated by the contract documents to the principle contractor and not the subcontractor.","An appeal from a decision declaring that the respondent Guardian was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant Hartford. The respondent had entered a contract with Fraser-Brace for the construction of a hospital. Without acknowledging liability, it paid $400,000 to Hartford to facilitate progress payments. Hartford sued to recover its money with interest from Hartford on the basis that the policy had been issued under the mistaken belief by the respondent that it was required to carry builder's risk insurance. The trial judge found the building was never at the insured's risk; the policy was void and the policy remained void. He ordered Hartford to repay Guardian the advances with compound interest. An appeal on the principal issue of compound interest was dismissed. There was no evidence nor even suggestion that the fire had caused the fire nor that there was an implied contractual obligation between the respondent and the Province. As Delta did not cause the fire loss it had no liability to the Province or Fraser Brace for causing it fire. In summary, there was no tortious or contractual liability of Delta for which the Guardian was obligated to respond as Delta's insurer. The Guardian policy provided that the insurance attached when the property became at the risk of the insured. In this case it never did. On these facts Guardian had no obligation to respond to under the terms of the policy issued to Delta. The obligation to insure the risk had been allocated by the Province by the contract with the Province and as Delta was not at risk for fire loss, Delta wasnt at risk of Delta's loss."
1999canlii12687.txt,"The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act. The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police. A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road. The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine. The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches. HELD: The evidence is excluded. The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance. The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question. The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement. The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation. The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get. The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van. The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law. The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van. The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event. The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of marijuana plants seized as a result of a warrantless search. The RCMP officer observed the accused operating a rental van with Ontario licence plates and noticed that one of the pockets of the accused was bulging and he asked the accused if he would empty his pockets. The officer told the accused that once he had arrested the accused, he could perform a search incidental to the arrest. The accused did not require a warrant as he had no reason to believe that he had consented to the search. He simply asked the question 'what is in the back of the van?' and the accused responded that he was looking for a place to relieve himself. At this point the police officer indicated that there were no officers working in the detachment at the time. The driver testified that he went to get a camera and then proceeded to try and open the black box. He was not able to open it as it was padlocked. When the officer approached the accused and asked him if he had two cases of wine, he asked him where he was going and he was told that the accused had asked him to open the other case of wine. The police officer then pulled the vehicle over to the rental van and began to search the interior of the vehicle for any evidence of what he believed to be drugs or alcohol. The vehicle was parked near a tourist information booth and there was a large amount of evidence taped to the window. The door was open and there were a number of items on the vehicle which could be interpreted as evidence of the trafficking of drugs into the province. The search was conducted in an investigative mode. The Crown did not suggest that prior to the information provided by the accused there was either reasonable or probable grounds nor any articuable cause for detention as discussed in R. v. Acciavatti (1993), 80 C.C.C.(3d) 109 (Ont. C.A.). HELD: The accused was detained arbitrarily whether the detention commenced when the RCMP officer stopped him on the street, when he requested him to empty his or his pockets, or when he put him in the rear of the cruiser. Counsel raised the following issues arising from the Charter of Rights and Freedoms being Schedule to the Canada Act 1982: 1) Was there an arbitrary detention contrary to s. 10(b) of the Charter; 2) Was the search unreasonable in contravention of s. 11(b); and 3) Did the search violate the appellant's Charter rights to freedom of expression?

The defendant has applied for an order setting aside the judgment and striking out the plaintiff's claim. A car-pedestrian accident occurred causing personal injury to the plaintiff. The defendant was convicted of dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The plaintiff sued for battery and assault. The defendant was noted for default on this claim and the damages were assessed at $37,717.35, $10,000 of which were punitive. The plaintiff submits that s.102 of the Act should not deprive a citizen of the right to sue a defendant for injuries caused by assault, battery, fraud, or similar torts. HELD: The plaintiff has no cause for action by virtue of her injuries having been caused by an automobile. The plaintiff was precluded by s.102 of the Act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. Although s.102 of the Act prohibits certain types of law suits, the act provides victims with compensation for injury. No order as to costs.","The plaintiff applied for an order pursuant to s.55 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act requiring Saskatchewan Government Insurance to pay to the plaintiff the amount awarded in a 1998 judgment. The defendant applied to strike the plaintiff's claim, saying s.102 of the Act precludes an action for damages as a result of the intentional inflicting of harm on a victim by use of motor vehicle, “then it is an actionable tort to beat someone up in Saskatchewan with a baseball bat but not so if the assailant uses an automobile”. HELD: There must be a declaration that the plaintiff was precluded, by s. 102 of The Act, from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. There will be no order as to costs."

Both held their property by deeds obtained at tax sales. Dismissing the appeal, that the respondent was entitled to a certificate of title to the land and a permanent injunction restraining the appellant from using said lands. The meaning of the word interval in describing lands in North America was discussed.","In a reserved decision, the trial judge found that the respondent was entitled to a certificate of title under the Act to certain lands including the six acres in dispute and to a permanent injunction restraining the appellant and her assigns from using the said lands in any way whatsoever. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that the appellant's claim to the disputed lands had been established. The land was originally comprised in tract approximately 133 acres owned by the Gillis brothers. During the years following their father's death in the Northwest Territories, the respondent, on the advice of his solicitor, decided to allow the taxes to fall into arrears and bid the property in at tax sale. On November 20, 1974 a tax sale of the respondent's lands was held by the Municipality of the County of Inverness, which bid at the sale with the successful bidder. Both parties filed an abstract of title as required by s.5 of the Quieting Titles Act. The evidence more than supported the decision."
b_2013skpc213.txt,HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of both charges. The Court believed the testimony of the complainant.,The accused was charged with committing sexual assault and for sexual purposes touching a person under the age of 16 directly with part of his body contrary to s. 151 of the Criminal Code. The complainant testified that she did not get along with the accused prior to the assault and that she no longer felt the same way about him. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. The Court found that the credibility of the witnesses was the most significant issue and an application of the instructions in R. v. W.D.[1] must be undertaken to determine with greater precision how the instructions are to be considered. Peculiar evidence for someone who claimed in court that he recalled the events of the entire day and who insisted that he did not commit the offences. He was clearly wrong when he told the Court that he was intoxicated.
3_2001skqb332.txt,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.","The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act. The first was for failing to file returns for a business held on behalf of a person who was not represented by counsel. The second was for failure to file GST returns. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)No error was found by the trial judge as there was no evidence to justify the learned provincial court judge's finding that returns were not filed, nor that there was unreasonable delay which compromised the appellants' right to a fair trial. 2)The Interpretation Act does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s. 21 of the Code. 3)The service of a demand to file a return upon a business operation was clearly an appropriate act to be performed by the Director of the Tax Services Office. The execution and serving of such a demand is purely an administrative act. It does not require the exercise of a Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of his or her rights by restricting any right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act."
b_1997canlii10986.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs applied for an order striking out the statement of defence and counterclaim and separate statement of Helen Rilkoff as not disclosing a reasonable defence or cause of action. The plaintiffs claimed the doctrine of res judicata applied to the claim for damages by virtue of two Small Claims court judgments in 1989 and 1992. The defendants asserted their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was different than those previously dealt with. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The fact that the plaintiffs filed a 55 page brief in support of their submissions and the defendants filed a 14 page brief in response evidenced that the issues were not easily resolved and certainly not on a summary basis.  2)An application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justifiable dispute is revealed. If no facts are in dispute, the parties may resort to Rule 188. Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve the questions of law.","FIAT.

The defendants asserted that their damages arose in 1994 and were a different cause than those dealt with in the 1989 and 1992 judgments.  4)The sufficiency of the pleadings did not raise any issues of law relevant to the application as a matter of convenience.  5)The Court dismissed the application with costs."

The application for a change of venue is denied. 2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue. There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports. However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application. In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue. However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found. Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre. It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered.","FIAT: The applicant brought an application for a change of venue in this matter pursuant to s.599(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused seeks an order granting a trial in the City of Prince Albert or some other judicial centre as the Court deems appropriate. The Crown counsel opposed the application. HELD: 1)The Court was satisfied that there was no question that the case had generated significant pre-trial publicity. However, it was also satisfied that a properly instructed jury will be able to deal with the issues in the trial impartially and in accordance with the evidence presented, such that the accused will receive a fair trial. 2)The application was denied.

At the second intersection he collided with another vehicle, causing serious injury to three people. He pleaded guilty to three counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm; the Crown proposed an intermittent sentence, but the judge sentenced him to nine months incarceration concurrent on each count plus two years probation with conditions. The appellant appealed on the grounds the judge failed to consider the Crown's recommendation, failed to sufficiently state his reasons, and the sentence was excessive. Dismissing the appeal, that the sentencing power of a judge is not limited by Crown submissions, that the failure to state every reason does not constitute and error, and that in view of the appellant's record and other factors, the sentence was not excessive to the point of constituting a reversible error.","The 19 year old appellant pled guilty in Provincial Court to three charges of dangerous driving causing bodily harm. He sought leave to appeal his sentence of nine months incarceration plus two years probation on each charge to be served concurrently and an assessment of his anger. The three Criminal Code convictions showed recklessness and disregard for the safety of others to a very high degree and the absence of the involvement of alcohol or drugs. Even so, the appellant's conduct bordering almost on the deliberate warrants the emphasis placed by the trial judge on general deterrence. Five motor vehicle accidents and three infractions involving the use of motor vehicle are not without significance. However, the three criminal convictions indicate a lack of respect for the law, which was demonstrated by the appellant in the serious injuries he suffered in the motor vehicle accident. His sentence was imposed on the basis of three aggravating circumstances: his driving record, his disregard of two stop signs, his inability to control his anger and his failure to report to counsel."

Appeal allowed; the plaintiff is entitled to renew the application for the amendment in Supreme Court chambers on notice to the proposed, as well as the existing, defendant within sixty days of today's date; if not filed within that time, the application to add the insurer will be deemed to have been abandoned. The court had a discretion to grant the amendment even though the case did not fall within any of the specific situations set out in Rule 15.02 as the broad power to amend conferred by Rule 15 is not limited to the specific instances set out the Rule. Although there was no firm rule that notice to a proposed defendant was necessary in all such applications, generally the applicant should give notice to the proposed defendant (as well as the existing parties) where it is apparent from the circumstances that the proposed defendant likely has a reasonable basis to oppose being joined, such as being prejudiced in its defence by the plaintiff's long delay in asserting his claim.","The appellant sues the Halifax Regional Municipality for negligence. Years later, he decided he should amend his action to add a new defendant. By then, the new claim was barred by a limitation period.

HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The Chief judge interpreted her oral reasons to include a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. 2)The evidence failed to convince the court beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. The fact that the conversation did not reach the point where the matter of payment was discussed would not preclude a jury from reasonably concluding that an act of prostitution involving the payment of payments for sexual favours was contemplated. 3)If indeed the judge had found that under s.(213) the Actus Reus must include a particular conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid for them, she was incorrect. 4)The Court of Appeal was ordered to restore the conviction and new trial ordered."

During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying. During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech. In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.  The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document. The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out. While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence. This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1).","The accused, charged with impaired driving, applied to the Court pursuant to s. 24(1) and s. 2 of the Charter for a variety of remedies, including a stay of the impaired driving charge, an order for a mistrial on that count, a direction that the Crown prosecutor be allowed to further cross-examine Crown witnesses and an order excluding evidence.

9_2013skca110.txt,"HELD: The Court addressed the issue of jurisdiction by holding that it would follow its usual practice to refuse to hear an entirely new matter argued for the first time on appeal. Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act. The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested. The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act. However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.","The appellant appealed the decision of the Chambers judge dismissing his application under Rule 173(e) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to strike out or stay the application of the Director of Community Operations for a community safety order under The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act because the Director's application constituted a multiplicity of proceedings and was therefore an abuse of process. Appeal dismissed; the jurisdiction to hear the appeal of this appeal can be found in the Court's general jurisdiction under ss. 7 and 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 and on the basis that the Court has jurisdiction in the circumstances of this case. HELD: The appeal is dismissed.  1) There can be no assumption that relitigation will yield a more accurate result than the original proceeding. However, if the same result is reached in the subsequent proceeding the Court is unable to fulfil its mandate with respect to the Premises. It is common ground the alleged prohibition against interlocutory applications was not argued before the trial judge. 2) The Director does not seek to overturn factual determinations made by the Hearing Officer, simply that the Director seeks to rely on the same facts that were before him, supplement those facts with new evidence, and ask a different decision maker to reach a different conclusion."

The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault. Allowing the appeal, that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity. The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward. The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife.

8_2010skca149.txt,"The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment. The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below. The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant. For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances. No error was made on this issue. The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz. The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting. She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests. There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them. The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children. There is no material error or misapprehension of the evidence.","The father appealed a decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties' children. The father argued that the chambers judge erred by failing to apply the principle of maximum contact, by applying a presumption of the status quo and by finding that evidence as to the wishes of the children was irrelevant. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Chambers judge correctly stated that s. 17(9) of the Act does not provide for the maximum contact principle alone which is adequate to order a shared parenting arrangement. 2) The evidence regarding the children's wishes was limited and inconclusive. In the context of conflicting evidence regarding their wishes, it is open to the judge to decline to make a finding on the issue and to proceed to base the decision on other factors. This argument cannot succeed.  3) The father focused primarily on the letters from the psychologists attached to his own affidavit. These were proffered by the father as evidence that the children were doing relatively well and seemed to be doing well in school. However, in this case, the Court was unable to draw any relevant causal connection between the letter and the decision. 4) The Court found there was an insufficient factual basis for the making of the custody order in issue."
6_2009skqb201.txt,"A bankruptcy petition against the applicant was filed on May 18, 1995 and a receiving order with respect to her property issued the following month. KPMG Inc. (formerly Peat Marwick Thorne Inc.) is the trustee of her bankrupt estate. The applicant received an absolute discharge on March 8, 1996. The trustee has never applied for a discharge. The trustee did not oppose the applicant's discharge and in its report dated February 8, 1996 stated that the there were no facts, matters or circumstances that would justify the Court in refusing an unconditional order of discharge. Now, more than 13 years later, there remains an unresolved issue concerning non-exempt equity in the applicant's homestead. The applicant applies for relief under s. 37 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for an order reversing the trustee's decisions and restoring the property interest to her. The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that only the value of non-exempt homestead equity existing at the time of the bankrupt's application for discharge can be attached by the trustee. HELD: The Court made the order applied for by the applicant including an order for costs.","A bankruptcy petition was filed in 1995 and received an absolute discharge on March 8, 1996. The trustee never applied for discharge. HELD: The order for costs was granted. 1)The nonexempt equity did not exist at the time of the application for discharge and the caveat should be vacated if it were not for the trustee's position that any increase in the equity will accrue to the benefit of the creditors.  2)The respondent was not empowered to make a decision on the discharge of the applicant's property unless it was warranted by the court. 3)The applicant was at the date of her bankruptcy registered as owner of residential property in the City of Saskatoon having an exemption in the amount of $32,000. The respondent's s.170 report assigned an estimated dollar value of $200,000 to this asset. Nevertheless, the report noted that the 'trustee is transmitting an 82% interest in the real property to the trustees' name'. That transaction was completed in 1996.  4)Exempt equity ceased to exist 13 years later when the bankrupt had paid off the mortgage and the home was valued at $82,000 according to the respondent's actuarial report. It was not appropriate in summary bankruptcy administration for a trustee to withhold timely application for a discharge and await a market enhancement of the value of non-exempt equity in homestead property. 5)The trustee was granted a stay of execution pending the application of this application by the applicant for discharge on the basis that she remained vested in the authority vested in her by the province pursuant to s.7 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (the Act). The stay was granted until the bankrupt moved into retirement home, which would be 30 years after the discharge. 6)None of the caveats were vacated."

HELD: 1) A party to litigation cannot decline to answer questions on an examination for discovery that are intended to elicit the facts on which that party has based its pleading. A party is required to divulge the facts that it has now or admit that it has none if such is the case. The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses. If the position of the defendant as set forth in those responses changes as a result of after acquired information, the defendant shall so inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 90 days following the completion of the defendant's examinations for discovery of the third parties. If it is necessary for the plaintiff to further examine for discovery on the defendant's responses or supplemental responses, the defendant's proper officer shall attend such examination for discovery. 2) The material filed satisfies the Court that PSAC documents relating to the PST issue are at least broadly relevant to the issues and that BJ Services likely has the power to obtain and produce them. The fact that BJ Services may intend to claim a litigation privilege over the documents, or that PSAC may not produce them, does not relieve BJ Services of the obligation to disclose their existence. BJ Services shall provide further and better disclosure of documents by providing a detailed list of documents referred to in the second part of the second schedule of its statement as to documents. If a claim for privilege is asserted over such documents, BJ Services shall identify the basis of such claim, the date of the documents, the name of the sender and the names of the recipients.","FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery. The plaintiffs also ask for further and better disclosure of documents over which a claim for privilege is asserted and to identify documents which they object to produce by reason of claim of privilege. HELD: 1) The purpose of the examination for discovery is to determine whether the third party contractor, pursuant to the governing legislation, is liable to pay PST on the sale of tangible personal property pursuant to s. 5(1), (2) and (6) of the Provincial Sales Tax Act. 2) The third parties have disclosed some of the defendant's positions in the statement of defence. The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination of its proper officer is concluded so that, if necessary, he can be further examined on the responses. The plaintiff seeks judgment against the defendant for the amount paid. 3) Examinations for discovery have been held by all parties. The court will not unduly restrict an examination by excluding questions broadly related to the issues when it appears that their relevance may well be resolved by other evidence not before the court on the application. 4) The broad relevance test applies to both disclosure and examination of documents and questions put and responses by third parties. In this regard, the court found that the third parties breached the statute by failing to provide full and complete responses. 5) The parties agreed to provide a detailed list of documents in their control so that the plaintiff may access them and find other documents which may be of interest to the plaintiff. 6) An undertaking filed with the court would provide a description of the documents sufficient to enable the party receiving the statement to assess and challenge the claim of a privilege. 7) The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $20,000. 8) In addition to the monies paid in the form of tax credits, the parties were also ordered to provide specific references to the provisions in the contracts which were considered to be ambiguous in terms of the question of whether or not there was a separate contract for sale of taxable personal property. Both of these undertakings were directly related to positions taken in the Statement of Defence. Both undertakings gave undertakings to respond to certain questions. Most of those undertakings have been satisfied.

b_2001skqb124.txt,"The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board. Under the voluntary arrangement doctors who chose not to enter the arrangement remained on-call to look after their own patients and to respond to emergencies. It worked well until Hanna established another clinic and began dividing his time between Regina and the Moosomin clinic. HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.  1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct. When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him. Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital. He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence. He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days. Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition. His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors. The on-call arrangement was voluntary. There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood. There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.  4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District. Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors. There was no basis in law or fact supporting the existence of a fiduciary relationship between Hanna and the Health District.","A medical doctor brought an action against three doctors alleging that each of them owed a duty of trust and a fiduciary duty to act towards him in good faith in connection with an arrangement entered into by all the doctors to perform the on-call services required of them by the defendant, the Pipestone District Health Board. HELD: The action against the three doctors was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)There was no evidence either in fact or in law supporting the existence of a trust or a relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. The arrangement was entirely voluntary. The plaintiff was neither the originator nor the party to it. The plan was introduced by the doctors and, to that extent, only co-operated with the doctors in its implementation. When it operated well it delivered to the hospital, without the plaintiff's involvement, the hospital would have suffered serious consequences. 2)There is no basis either in law or in legal evidence supporting either of the above mentioned relationships. The relationship between doctors and the hospital is entirely voluntary and no evidence was brought into evidence that it compromised the hospital's standards or authority. 3)The court dismissed the action against Crouse and Kirsch as being totally voluntary. 4)The plaintiff had no standing to sue the doctors for breach of contract or negligent misrepresentation."
7_2001canlii346.txt,"The Crown withdrew one count at the opening of the trial and the accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration in excess of .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying. The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.","The accused was charged with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called as witnesses the boyfriend of the accused's sister-in-law and the doctor of a civilian who at the time of trial was an inmate. The police officer testified that he asked the doctor for permission to take the blood and he signed the doctor's certificate. The doctor's testimony was that he had no recollection either of who actually took the blood or of signing the second certificate. HELD: On the evidence as a whole, the Court concluded that the facts in the mind of the officer when he decided to make the demand amount to reasonable and probable grounds. 1)The facts were in the officer's mind at the relevant time and place when the blood was taken. He was focused on the needs of his patient. The officer was not aware that the vials of blood were being taken by the medical practitioner or under the supervision of a medical practitioner. The medical practitioner clearly would not have done so if he were of the opinion that the taking of the blood would not endanger the life or health of his client. 2)There was no evidence as to whether the officer gave the Certificate of Qualified Medical Practitioner or Certificate of Analysis. 3)The Court was not satisfied that the Certificate was valid. The Certificate was not signed by the doctor as required by the certificate. 4)The court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer would have acted to prevent any occurrence that would have endangered his life or that of his patients. The Court was also satisfied that there were no other logical conclusions on the facts than that either the doctor took the samples himself or the technician took them under the direction of the doctor."
d_2011skpc110.txt,"The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After being detained at the police station, the accused attempted unsuccessfully to reach three different lawyers. Eventually, he spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel who advised him that the officer had not made forthwith an ASD demand and that his s. 10(b) Charter rights had been infringed. The accused sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: The accused was arbitrarily detained for 11 minutes and a sample of his breath was obtained. However, the officer appeared to have acted in good faith and the accused was not subjected to the unreasonable and unnecessary delay. The admission of the certificate ofalyses would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court found that the accused's Charter rights were not breached. The Certificate of Analyses was admitted into evidence.  1) It was the Court's view that the Charter breaches were moderately serious and the delay of 11 minutes was largely due to the unavailability of an ASD. 2) There is no rule with respect to the exact number of minutes which must elapse before the demand falls outside the 'forthwith' requirement. 3) Following R. v. Rilling, once breath samples are provided under s. 254(3), the officer's grounds for demanding the samples are irrelevant. 4) The Court was unable to determine whether the delay was caused by the officers' failure to inform the accused of his right to consult counsel prior to making the demand.  5) It is the Court’s view that once the accused is detained for an extended period of time, he is not given an opportunity to seek counsel. He was not provided with the option of either sitting or taking a seat in the police vehicle with the assistance of a breathalyser.  6) There was nothing to indicate the accused could not have made the demand forthwith."
9_2005nssc297.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended. The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal entered. The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle. But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.","The appellant plead not guilty to driving a motor vehicle while suspended contrary to s. 287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. At trial, the Crown called one witness, a Halifax police officer, who testified that he was the appellant's son. The appellant argued that the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him, i.e., his glimpse of the appellant driving his auto as a sole occupant while unlicensed versus the defence witnesses, his son and three other witnesses. He appealed his conviction. Appeal allowed; conviction stayed; it would be impractical to order a new trial at this date and order a verdict of acquittal. The adjudicator made no significant review of the evidence."

The chambers judge granted the application finding that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information and that to allow the writ to stand would constitute an abuse of process. The issue on appeal is whether the chambers judge erred in inquiring into the accuracy of the facts sworn to in the proposed appellant's affidavit, in light of the provision in Rule 407(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules that provides that the validity of the writ shall not be questioned in any interlocutory proceeding where the affidavit substantially complies with the requirements of the Rule.

HELD: (1)Application dismissed. The Provincial Court judge was not biased and the accused received full disclosure with respect to the charge. In an application to quash committal for trial there is only one ground for action by the reviewing court and that is lack of jurisdiction. (2)Application dismissed. The conditions imposed by the Provincial Court Judge were justified. He did not err in law or in his application of the facts.,"FIAT. At a preliminary hearing, the defendant applied to quash a decision of the Provincial Court judge committing him to stand trial on a charge that he committed a defamatory libel against a police officer contrary to ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code and a complaint about disclosure by the defendant regarding an ongoing investigation of another potential offence. The preliminary hearing was not a scintilla of evidence to suggest either the judge was biased or that there was an apprehension of bias. The defendant appeared to indicate that he had received full disclosure with respect to the defamation charge and that his complaint was with respectto an ongoing criminal investigation. He also applied for an order quashing certain conditions of a recognizance issued at the preliminary hearing."

The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer. The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer. 1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed. Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.  2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other. The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer.","HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of the aggravated assault on the complainant. The court found that the accused had used more force than was necessary to defend himself and that the injury to the complainant's ankle was a serious one. The Court sentenced the accused to three counts, being a curfew breach and an alcohol abstention breach on his undertaking. On count 2, the accused punched the officer in the face and it was clear from the testimony of the three other witnesses that the assault had ended in the complainant being assaulted. The accused was acquitted of all counts on the basis of the first two counts."

Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed. The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled.

The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate. The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)Our civil procedure does not contemplate the trial of an issue on a person's competence to bring a lawsuit. A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act had the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding legal proceedings and would result in the appointment of a litigation guardian. This step was not deemed necessary based on the evidence presented. A stay was refused.  2)Costs incurred in defending a civil action against a person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are recoverable from the estate. 3)Queen's Bench Act s.50 did not apply.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to his costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT.

The applicants recognized that if the plaintiff was found to be incompetent and the action was discontinued, or the defendants were successful in their defence, that they would be at risk of not being able to collect taxable costs against the plaintiff. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the application was simply another subterfuge and abuse of process to obtain evidence to support the original findings of incompetency to the benefit of the applicants in the law suit and to possibly obtain a new certificate of incompetent. It would seem inappropriate that the Court should order a single examination for determination of an issue where it would be unwise to act on a single recommendation. A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to s38.3 of the Act has the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding the proceedings of trial for the simple reason that the issuance of a certificate would result in a litigation guardian being appointed."
8_2009skqb54.txt,"FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick. To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG). MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent. Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference. Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced. The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process. They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money. The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process. HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed. 1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.  'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act. The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications. They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses. The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act. That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction. The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act. The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed. They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. 2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case. There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions. That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed.","FIAT: The action commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. The defendants and third parties applied to the court to stay either permanently or on an interim basis, the plaintiff's claim commenced pursuant pursuant to the 2015 legislation. The applicants argue that the actions are an abuse of the court's process and that the court has the statutory and inherent jurisdiction to order the action stayed. HELD: The Court accepts that virtually all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action. The Court also notes that the Court is now 'no costs' jurisdiction providing for the certification of national multi-jurisdictional class action on an 'opt-out' basis. The application to stay is premature and an unnecessary duplication of resources and expense."

Joint custody awarded for all four children, with the father to have primary care and control of the oldest and the mother to have primary care and control of the three younger children; the father is to pay child support for three children in the guideline amount and the mother is to pay child support for one child in the guideline amount; the husband's equity in the matrimonial home is frozen at the amount owing on the mortgage when the parties separated and his interest is postponed until the youngest child reaches the age of 21 years; if the wife wishes to obtain a new home in a new location, she will be required to pay out the husband's equity in the matrimonial home.","The petitioner sought a divorce and custody, child support and an order directing that the respondent's equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child was 19 years old. The respondent also sought custody of the three children in the marriage, with the respondent having primary care and control of the children and himself having liberal access. The husband argued that the children had been members of the cubs since before the separation and he would like to move to a new area where the children would be eligible for scholarships under the Trust Fund. The mother sought joint custody with the husband. The father argued that he would be unable to contribute proportionately to the children's special and extraordinary expenses because they were living in a trailer and the pipes froze and the house needed various repairs. HELD: 1)The respondent was required to pay child support of $7,500 to the respondent and $8,000 per year to cover the cost of the two youngest children attending university and orthodontic treatment, to the extent that it is not met by the Child Tax Credit, but the payments can be paid from the 'children's fund' as well as from the Maintenance Enforcement Program. 2)The mother would be required to retain the one vehicle owned by the husband and to pay any claim for spousal support, extraordinary expenses and maintenance expenses. 3)The father's income was $21,059.25 in 2003. He earned $27,147.14 in 2003 and $25,000 in 2004. He was paying $1,400 per month in support and had recently purchased a trailer to live in. It would be impossible for him to have the children with him for extended periods of time as he was working and living in the trailer. 4)The Trust Fund was to be divided among the parties. 5)Each party was to keep their own vehicle. One vehicle was purchased at the time of an attempted reconciliation, with money supplied from a line of credit. The vehicle was worth twice the amount of the vehicle he retained. He agreed to return the children to their mother's home at a determined hour if that was not possible. In the event that the parties were unable to arrange an acceptable schedule for this purpose, the Fund would be divided equally and the balance of the payments payable by the parties would be covered by the Fund. 6)Costs were left to the mother."

The trustee, who must act in the best interest of all creditors, should not be advised by the bank's counsel. Granting the order. The court, applying its supervisory powers, found the trustee should not be represented by the bank's counsel. On Appeal.","This was an application by the applicant for an order prohibiting the law firms from acting as counsel for the Trustee of the estate. The Trustee had been appointed by the Bank as custodian of the property of the bankrupt and claimed to be a creditor of that bankrupt. The Bank wanted to have its counsel nominated as solicitors for it. The trustee resisted on the grounds that there were significant areas of conflict with the interests of the Bank and that its counsel could serve two masters whose interests may be in conflict: the trustee's duty of fairness not only to all the creditors but also to the bankrupt. This conflict of interest demanded the removal of the present counsel. HELD: 1)A clear distinction must be drawn between the duties and obligations of a receiver-manager appointed under the terms of a debenture and one made by the court. In the former case, the trustee becomes an officer of the court and acts in a fiduciary capacity to all parties involved in the litigation. To so decide would mean that any shareholder of bankrupt need only commence a spurious law suit in order to cause financial hardship to the petitioning creditor or generally to disrupt bankruptcy proceedings.

At the time that the applicants were served with the statement of defence and counterclaim, they were not represented by counsel nor did they know that they had to serve and file a statement of defence to the counterclaim.

The plaintiff claimed the creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account for a lesser sum ($2,000 on a $15,600 account). He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'. The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001. In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle. An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died. The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible. SGI initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in May 2002 claiming $17,660.

The plaintiff assigned to the defendant future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments but agreed to settle the debt for a lesser sum. The defendant says it was induced to settle by the plaintiff's false representation that 1. Saskatchewan Government Insurance was suing him for between $250,000 and $300,000; 2.

The subtleties involved in making the distinction between factually and legally as to whether plaintiff's remarks constituted an operative misrepresentation cannot be resolved in the absence of cross-examination and it would not otherwise be unjust to do so.

9_2002skpc30.txt,"The Crown applied for three DNA warrants pursuant to s.487.05 of the Criminal Code. Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result. The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155. The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation. 'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable. Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed. Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a). 2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations. The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable. There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking. The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out. The paragraphing format was confusing. 3)A DNA warrant application would be premature. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood. It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained. It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 487.05 of the Criminal Code for DNA warrants to obtain blood samples from the male, the female and the child. The Informations in Support were sworn by an RCMP officer. Each alleges that the middle-aged man and his 19-year old daughter have committed incest, contrary to ss. 155 of the Code, and that child, now months old, has been born as result of the incestuous relationship. The child is obviously not in any position to give an informed consent, instruct counsel or otherwise avail itself of the information required to be provided pursuant s.487.07. The DNA of the 19 year old woman, as set out on the baby's Registration of Live Birth, is of no probative value as it is not linked in any satisfactory fashion to the alleged father. Nor is there any indication as to the source of the natural mother's information. HELD: A DNA warrant application with respect to the child would be premature, but may be renewed in due course if the Crown is advised of the necessity of providing some basic evidence which can satisfy the court that the technician or expert who will carry out DNA procedures is properly qualified to do so.  1) The paragraphing format used in the present applications is confusing and detracts from ease of reference and understanding. There is nothing in s.485(1)(b) which can in the best interests of the administration of justice be concluded that a blood sample of a child born of an 'incestuous relationship' which is not in the possession of the Crown and which remains in the child's body, is a bodily substance. 2) The proper inference to be drawn from the words of s.155(2) is that a warrant may be issued when some substance such as saliva, semen, hair, blood or like product produced by or excreted or discharged from the body is found at or obtained in conjunction with a crime scene, or is found in or obtained from a person or thing associated with the commission of an offence. This is especially the case when the relationship is short-lived. 3) The probative benefits of DNA analysis do not set out whether the father and mother have a certificate or any similar qualification, nor is the qualification of the corporal who trained him set out.

e_2007skqb179.txt,"Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test. The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement. The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly.","This is an application for judicial review of a Board of Arbitration Award which held that the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a Collective Agreement in force between the parties. The facts of the case are reasonably straightforward. The applicant made an effort to have the decision reversed, arguing that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance which did not involve parties to the collective agreement. He also brought the issue within the purview of the Agreement. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. The reasons as a whole support the decision. The decision meets the reasonableness test. 1) The applicant failed in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member. The board made a clear finding of fact that the alleged breach of the Collective Agreement occurred while the applicant was acting in his capacity as Chair of the Board of Governors and not as an officer of the Federation. There is no disputing the applicant's claim that he was invited to speak at the symposium, but the Board's determination does not address the allegation that there was a violation of academic freedom. With respect to the formal grievance, the applicant does not agree. The FOU has a unique institution in both philosophy and mandate and has a distinct responsibility to safeguard and promote academic freedom as our collective wisdom grows. Following the pragmatic and functional approach referred to in the judgment of the SCC, it is clear the standard of review to be applied in this case is one ofreasonableness. It is not unreasonable for the applicant to conclude that his dispute with Dr. Stonechild should affect the opportunity for him to appear at the Symposium to present his research, but not in the way it would have in any event if the Board had not acted in the discharge of its duty to defend and defend academic freedom in the context of a collective agreement in force. 2) The Board's conclusion that the applicant had not interfered with the faculty member's academic freedom was not supported by the reasons as whole."

By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease. This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business.","The Bank of Montreal (the Bank) presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent Patchrite (Patchrite) respecting assets leased by the Bank.

d_2013skqb59.txt,"The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant. She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse. The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year. The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail. The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time.","FIAT: This is a high-conflict family law matter. The mother wants to change her residence (and that of the two children) presently. The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this calendar year. The parties married in 2008 and separated in 2011. Two years ago, the mother unilaterally moved with the children from Nokomis to Kenaston, notwithstanding an existing order of this court. That move was reversed in January 2012, and that issue was adjourned pending the receipt of the custody/access report. HELD: 1) The mother has always been the primary caregiver to the children. There is nothing suggesting the two boys have anything other than a close and loving relationship with her. 2) Even on an interim basis the court must embark upon a fresh inquiry as to what is in these children's best interests. This is not a balancing act; rather, it is a fresh consideration of all relevant circumstances relating to the needs of the children, and there is no presumption in favour of the present custodial parent. There should be some connection maintained. That can be done through telephone access. However, there should be also some form of monitoring. If the father is eligible for early release in December 2013, the children will not have close ties to their children for the duration of this year and perhaps beyond. 3) There is no reasonable basis to have matters resolved in the father's favour. While personal access may be beneficial to children in some instances it is not necessarily beneficial to them on a balance of probabilities. Their lives cannot remain 'on hold' while he awaits release for any other sort of economic opportunity. These are circumstances where the court does not have alternatives. The court reviewed the circumstances of the petitioner mother's move and found that the mother was the only available parent for the foreseeable future. She had formed a new relationship and her pregnancy meant a new sibling will be introduced into their lives. Should they be deprived of the benefits of growing up with their new brother or sister, who is presently en ventre sa mere? It is difficult to see an argument favouring such an arrangement. If she is forced to move, it would appear the new child (once born) would not have such benefits as they did in Anderson. This defies common sense. 4) The court adopted the Gordon v. Goertz principles. They are applicable to any situation where a material change of circumstances affecting the children would mean nothing to them in terms of removal from"

He deposited a security deposit and rent in his personal account and used it for personal living expenses. When the owner inquired, he caused a false lease to be provided to her showing the rental commencing two months later than it actually did; he then failed to remit some rent and was late remitting other rent. He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission. At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible. The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000. The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed. Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision. It is patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions; reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible as to set out the reasoning process of the tribunal and demonstrate a consideration of all of the relevant factors.","A licensed realtor appeals the finding of unprofessional conduct made by a discipline sub-committee of the Nova Scotia Real Estate Commission and the sanctions imposed, including a two year license suspension and order to pay costs of $9,980.08. The Court found that the decision of the commission was quickly made, did not reflect the time needed to consider the totality of the evidence presented, and was patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions. The Commission erred in law by having no juristic basis to apply such a harsh and severe penalty."
e_2002nssc20.txt,"The applicant operated commercial private billiards club with liquor licence and served bar food. The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation. The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement. The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change. There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed.","The applicant sought an order declaring that the land use by-law of the respondent permits the operation of a billiard club open to the public. The applicant had a special premises liquor license, granted by the Province of Nova Scotia, which allowed the sale of liquor on the premises. The club was located in an area which was subject to the respondent's Land Use By-laws. A development agreement was entered whereby the permitted uses for the club consisted of pool tables, beer, wine, and a bar. The bar was to be open to members of the club only and not the general public. If the club was to operate as a lounge it would require a development permit. It would also have to comply with the zoning provisions of the Village of Enfield. HELD: The applicant's application was dismissed. The court found that the change in the liquor license sought by the applicant constituted a change in use which would adversely affect the character of the property and the development agreement process. It was unnecessary to consider the ramifications or results of a possible change of non-conforming use."

Immediately after the appointment of the receiver, the supplier presented a written demand for repossession of the books. The receiver refused, claiming that the books were subject to an agreement for sale to the institution's students and therefore, exempt.  A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed. Appeal allowed; return of books or payment of their value to the supplier ordered. Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time. The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand. The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials. Thus, the books were not subject to any agreement for resale within the meaning of the Act.","This was an appeal by a supplier from the refusal by a receiver to issue an order requiring the receiver to release goods to the supplier pursuant to s. 81.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (1985). The single issue was whether the judge erred in finding that the goods were subject to an agreement for sale at arms' length at the time the supplier presented a written demand for repossession. The fact that it intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide those particular materials. Furthermore, as of the date of the supplier's demand, these books were not subject to any agreement for Sale within the meaning of s.81.1(1)(c)(v).

The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial. The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants. Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment. The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation. The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media. HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition. Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time. It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial.","The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants, Xtreme Mining & Demolition Inc. and Leonard Banga, for wrongful dismissal and for inducing breach of contract.

c_2009nssc180.txt,"At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007). Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009. The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years. The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines. She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it. The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands. Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward. The father's hardship arguments rejected. He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income. The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient. Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied. The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses. During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family.","The mother sought an order that would provide parenting provisions as to their son and child maintenance payable in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines in the form of table amount and contribution to special or extraordinary expenses. Prior to the 2009 Consent Order, there was no written agreement or court order dealing with child maintenance. The father had made overtures to the mother for increased child maintenance but had resisted such requests indicating lack of income to provide any additional amount. The mother applied for relief pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act in October 2007. Consent Order dated January 2009 provided relief to almost all of the issues raised in the proceeding, including ongoing child maintenance beginning January 2008. However, the father had been paying less than legally required given his income and the dictates of the Guidelines; his child maintenance obligation had to be increased and he was in arrears with regard to child maintenance for the years 2001 to the end of 2007. There was agreement as to the status of the child and the father's obligation to provide child support. Reasonable Excuse for Delay The mother sought retroactive child support retroactive to the date of their separation. She requested that the father increase his monthly payment as she was not made aware of what were his child support responsibilities as dictated by the Guidelines and that he had 'effective notice' that his current payment was deficient. In her pre-trial brief, the mother acknowledged that she had been under an incorrect assumption as to his income while being over extended given her responsibilities as to caring for the aging parents. She was consistently being told by the father that he did not have the financial ability to provide additional child maintenance and that this denial was the result of her failure to take action to be reimbursed for such expenses at an earlier date."

The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer. The police had no authority to search the computer generally. They were only authorized to look at the Internet history. The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right.

He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.  1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type. It operated at 2,500 lbs. pressure. This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user. The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn. 2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor. Where an enterprise or activity is inherently dangerous, the duty to warn can not be delegated. In such a situation the party who retains the independent contractor remains vicariously liable. 3)The waiver in the rental contract was ineffective. It was a standard form agreement signed on its face with the terms of the contract on the reverse. 4)The Plaintiff was awarded general damages of $10,000.00, $5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and recovered $3,789.50 for SHSP. 5)The usual increase in general damages for inflation and pre-judgment interest were both reduced because the Plaintiff had not presecuted his action expeditiously.","The plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from a shop which was owned by the defendant. He signed a form of agreement and was told how to clean the gun part of the sprayer after completion of the work. No warning was given respecting any hazards in using the sprayers, and no warning was printed on the agreement. HELD: The plaintiff's finger was amputated at the second knuckle. The court assessed the plaintiff's damages for pain and suffering and loss ofamenities of life at $10,000. This was especially so here where the non-pecuniary damage issue was uncomplicated. In the particular circumstances the defendant cannot escape responsibility to the plaintiff in either relationship. Having provided the plaintiff with a dangerous product for lease to others, the defendant remained vicariously liable. The plaintiff ought to have brought the matter on for trial more expeditiously. The claim was not properly pursued for six years because there was no excuse for dragging on this minimal damage action for so long."

As for the award of maintenance, we did not find an award of $700.00 a month for the length of the relationship (15 years), the husband's wage (approximately $55,000 per year) and the fact that the wife had seldom worked outside the home."

The tenants applied under the Residential Tenancies Act for the return of their security deposit and damages including moving expenses. The landlord was out of country at the time of the hearing but authorized by letter that the caretaker would attend the hearing to represent the landlord. The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment. The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement. The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision. The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable. HELD: The landlord's appeal was dismissed. 1) The tenant gave notice of his claim by two separate documents and the landlord showed no misapprehension of the tenants' position based on his written response. The landlord did not indicate in his letter that the caretaker had a limited role and the landlord could have sought an adjournment but did not.  2) Section 70(6)(c) of the Act empowers the hearing officer to order payment of damages where the hearing officer considers it just and equitable. The wording of this provision is broad and unconstrained excepting that the nature of damages that may be imposed must not be punitive. The decision on rent abatement was principled and to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space. The award for moving costs was intended to compensate for inconvenience, aggravation and related expenses. The awards were reasonable both in fact and law and no reviewable error was made by the hearing officer. Corrigendum released dated November 15, 2011 and added to fulltext.","The issue before the hearing officer concerned the tenants' claim for damages and return of the security deposit arising out of the landlord's notice to vacate. The tenants reluctantly accepted termination even though it was short notice. They applied under the Act for the return of their security deposit and other damages. The landlord contends he was not given opportunity to be heard, or to adequately respond to the tenants’ claim. He contends the tenants failed to properly identify which area of the unit was unusable, failed to describe the relief sought, or the nature of argument they intended to advance. Moreover, as the owner was unable to attend on the scheduled hearing date, the matter proceeded unfairly without an opportunity for him to be Heard. HELD: The Court held that the decision on rent abatement was made on a principled and logical basis having regard to the facts. The purpose of the award was to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space. The award for moving costs was intended in part to compensate for inconvenience and aggravation, and in part as compensatory loss for related expenses.

Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.  HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security. 2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer. The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.  6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","The issue on this appeal is the priority of security interest in a mobile home granted by the respondent to the applicant and subsequent purchaser for value, the Credit Union having regard to the operation of s. 28(1) and s. 30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The issues are not in dispute. The trial judge found that the respondent authorized the sale of the mobile home and the title passed to the buyer, Spruce Meadow Trucking Ltd., free from the secured interest. It was at this time that Lanson discovered that the mobile Home had been sold and attempted to seize it. The Credit Union resisted seizure and an application was brought before the Court of Queen's Bench to find priorities as between the parties. HELD: The appeal is reduced to whether the respondent, the secured party had to authorize the buyer (the Credit Union) to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. The fundamental issue is whether the authorization is subject to the pre-condition of payment in full.  1) This interpretation is incorrect. The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. The respondent clearly gave the secured creditor (Lanson), who gave the security interest to the security, that dealing would include resale. 2) The fact the debtor failed to pay his secured creditor does not invalidate the sale to the purchaser.  3) The appellant relied heavily on Canadian Commercial Bank v. Tisdale Farm Equipment Ltd., which found that 'dealing' with the security was based on the express condition that the security would only be released on payment of the entire proceeds in circumstances where all parties, including the vendor the purchaser and the holder of the security Interest, had knowledge of the Security interest. That is not the case here. The secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security on an express condition the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor that he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secure party. 3) In this case Lanson authorized the dealing and the sale did not occur in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by the terms of the P.P.S.A., with the result that his security interest continues and takes priority over that of the Credit union. Credit Union appeals this decision.  4) The Appeal is directed to the Supreme Court of Canada."

HELD:1)The father was to pay $454 for child support for the two children who lived with the mother. His proportionate share of orthodontic expenses was 86% ($1,677) to be paid by five payments of $280. 2)The respondent's average income over 1994-96 for the purpose of determining child support was $32,243.39. The 1997 income information was not included because the financial evidence was insufficient. 15% of the capital cost allowance was imputed pursuant to s19 for the 1994-96 taxation years. Deducting all of the respondent's capital cost allowance was not a reasonable expense. An adverse inference was not drawn from the failure to produce the financial records of the respondent's farming partner. 3)The applicant's average income for 1994-96 for purposes of calculating the s7 expense was $5,278.40. 4)The father was to pay $1,800 prior to April 30/98 as payment under the 1990 order. 5)The father was ordered to produce the documents referred to in s21 to the applicant by May 1st each year. 6)The applicant was awarded solicitor/client costs of her application to determine the amount of outstanding maintenance owing for 1996 and 1997 and her taxable costs on the balance of the application.","The mother brought a motion for variation of child support pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines. She also brought an application for an order fixing the amount owing under the previous child support order of Baynton J., dated September 5, 1990. Much of the evidence is disputed between the parties. Both counsel confirmed that they wished the issues resolved on the basis of affidavit evidence, without resorting to viva voce. HELD: 1)The affidavit evidence was not sufficient nor substantiated sufficiently to determine income. 2)The respondent was to impute 15% of the capital cost allowance claimed on personal property to the applicant pursuant to s.19 in each of the above years. 3)The applicant had appropriately deducted expenses from her gross income as she deducted portion of her home and vehicle expenses. The average of these three years of income was $32,243.39. The mother's taxable costs were $7,226.20, $5,606.82 and $3,002.20. The reasonableness of an expenses deduction is not solely governed by whether the deduction is permitted under the Income Tax Act. 4)The 1997 income information was not included in the calculation despite the fact that the guidelines require the court to use the most recent information."

No City employees were working on the site. ISSUES: 1)Is the picketing secondary picketing? 2)Is the manner of picketing unlawful in any event? HELD: Application allowed. 1)Picketing of the premises of an employer, where there is no direct dispute between him and the picketers or between him and his employees, is secondary picketing, is per se unlawful and cannot be jusified merely because the picketers are engaged in a legal strike against another employer who has business relations with the employer being picketed. 2)If the court had determined that the subject picketing was not secondary picketing, then, in the particular circumstances it would still have held that the subject picketing was unlawful, and ought to be restrained, as, on the whole of said evidence it was satisfied that the applicant had established that said picketing was not being carried on for the purpose of lawful communication, but, rather, was being carried on in a manner designed to obstruct, impede and interfere with the lawful performance by the applicant of its construction contract on the construction site.",The plaintiff sought an order restraining the defendants from engaging in secondary picketing and thereby interfering with the plaintiff's lawful use of the premises and with its contracts with its own subcontractor and suppliers. The defendants granted an order abridging the time for service and return of the notice of motion and permitting the plaintiff to proceed with the trial of the action. The injunction was granted on the basis of the following grounds: 1) that the picketing was lawful in the sense that it was merely peaceful picketing for the purpose of communicating information; 2) that there was no question that picketing took place at the entrance to the premises adjacent to the pollution control plant and that those picketers had addressed intimidating language towards the operators of vehicles attempting to enter and exit the premises; and 3) that damage had been caused to vehicles when one of the picketers swung a wooden picket sign at them and caused damage to one of their vehicles.

5_2008nspc12.txt,"A youth was arrested and charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle after the vehicle arrived near the location of a pre-arranged drug transaction. The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear. A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized. The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive. There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search. This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person.","The accused was charged with having in his possession, crack cocaine, contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. A voir dire held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search of the accused and the admissibility of 17.8 grams of crack cocaine found on the young person. The police had earlier determined that the accused would be held overnight and taken to court the following day to be arraigned on a charge of possession of stolen vehicle. The accused had placed a call to a third party to arrange for a drug transaction and the officer told the accused that he could get the vehicle back by arranging a drug deal. At the time of the call, the accused placed a second call to the third party and arranged for a meeting in the hope that the person would return the vehicle with a quantity of the drug. The fourth call, in which the accused indicated that he was going to buy crack cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, was never completely undressed and at no time did he remove his clothing or remove the drugs from his underwear himself. The strip search was conducted as quickly as possible to prevent the loss or destruction of drugs and to prevent its disposal by the accused. Although significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the youth person, the Court found that the search was specifically related to the totality of circumstances surrounding the arrest and was not incidental to the reasons for the arrest itself. The evidence was found to be relevant to the trial proper. In the event of a Charter breach, the evidence would nonetheless be ruled admissible."
9_2014skpc205.txt,"There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility. The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment. The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent. The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister. Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication. It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused is charged with sexual assault of the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The charge arises from sexual activity that occurred between the accused and the complainant in December 2012. The complainant has no memory of the sexual activity due to an alcohol induced blackout. The Crown argues that there was no consent. The accused does not deny that he had sex with the complainant. He claims that the activity was consensual or, alternatively, that he has an honest but mistaken belief in consent. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The Court heard contradictory evidence with respect to the central issue of consent, an assessment of credibility, which is to be assessed in light of all the evidence. It is open to the accused to claim that the complainant's words and actions, before and during the incident, raise a reasonable doubt against her assertion that she, in her mind, did not want the sexual touching to take place. If the complainant did not consent, did the accused have an honest and mistaken belief that consent? Consent is an essential component of both the actus reus and mens rea and if the accused believed the activity had been consensual, he lacked the mens dea for sexual assault. The evidence of the two accused and their daughter was indicative of active participation. While there were some minor inconsistencies, the complainant testified that she was not able to communicate with the accused's daughter, who burst into the bedroom and demanded that she leave. The defence witnesses testified that their testimony raised reasonable doubt about their non-consent and that they were incapable of consent."

On the drive home, she was injured in a motor vehicle accident when she fainted and her car crossed the centre line of the highway and struck another vehicle. She sued three members of the clinic staff, including the doctor who performed the abortion, alleging negligence in letting her drive after the abortion. Awarding the plaintiff $724,000 for past and future loss of income, future loss of pension, and general damages, that based on the evidence of the possible complications from surgery such as an abortion, and considering the emotional impact of an abortion on all women, the defendants breached their standard of care as health care professionals in permitting the plaintiff to drive after the abortion.","The plaintiff nurse took part in a separate action against the defendants after she was injured in a motor vehicle accident. The nurse advised against driving after having an abortion. The plaintiff also testified that she was concerned about the plaintiff's ability to drive home after having the abortion. Awarding $115,000 in damages, that the plaintiff was simply listed as a defendant by mistake. The court found that this was a judgment call on the part of the nursing staff to determine if the patient was well enough to leave on her own. The plaintiffs' evidence on liability was admitted as follows: 1)It is not uncommon for a nurse to operate a vehicle after an abortion, but this particular nurse was not permitted to drive. She operated the 'MacPhail Vehicle' in an Easterly direction, in the direction of Halifax, towards exit 4. When it was known that she had no one to drive her home, the procedure should have been postponed to another date. The general policy at the time was that patients should not drive for more than 24 hours following sedating medication. 2)The Court found that one of the common side effects of all benzodiazepines (including Ativan) is the anterograde amnesia which is a memory of events occurring for some time after the stimulus, the surgery is over. This effect is considered to be desirable in persons undergoing medical procedures they may fear. 3)The plaintiff was awarded $55,000 as general damages for loss, injury and loss of control of the vehicle. The remaining $45,000 was awarded to the mother."
e_2007skca122.txt,"This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","This was an appeal from a decision of Madam Justice Rothery who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant against the respondents (defendants), the defendants, and the Village of Bjorkdale. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Court found that the trial judge employed the right test in addressing the motion, having addressed it along the lines of whether the plaintiff had adduced sufficient evidence, considered in its best light, to enable the jury, properly instructed and acting judicially, to find the defendants or them liable in negligence. 2) The evidence could not reasonably been concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extent of the appellant's injury.

He sought a declaration pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 interpreting the bylaws of the condominium corporation with respect to the voting rights of the commercial unit owners. The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units. The remaining 29 units are residential. The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors. A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders. The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board. HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw. There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners. Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting. The proper interpretation of the bylaws has nothing to do with the principles of contract interpretation. The application was dismissed.

d_2013skpc56.txt,"The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","The accused was convicted of possession for the purposes of trafficking cocaine (Cocaine for the Purpose of Trafficking) and wilfully failed to comply with a youth probation order by failing to attend a youth court function. The accused was only one month into a probation order when he was found with one package of cocaine on his person, also in the possession of $660 cash. The Crown had previously placed the accused on a 6 month deferred custody and supervision order on all three counts. The Court found that with this not being a violent offence and with his limited criminal record, the accused was not subject to custody under either s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act or (c). The Ontario Court of Appeal provided some guiding principles on the use of s. 40(1) in its decision on R. v. R.E.W. The term 'exceptional' in both criminal law and legislation is intended to describe the clearest of cases. Such cases include those where applying the normal rules would undermine the purpose and principles of sentencing contained in s. 38. However, this Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the prime motivation behind the drug trafficking operation was financial gain."
5_1998canlii13934.txt,"Landlord and Tenant - Writ of Possession_____ The landlord applied for an order for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The 41 month lease required a monthly rental of $500 for the first five months and thereafter semi-annual payments of $5,000. The tenants had not paid any rent in 1998 nor had they maintained insurance; they installed alternating stalls in the barn in breach of their covenant not to make any alterations or additions to the premises; breached the express and implied covenants to keep the premises in good condition and tenantable repair by their failure to remove and properly dispose of baler twine, to maintain proper weed control or to remove manure buildup in the calf barn. The tenants admitted the rental payment was due in May but claimed the landlord breached the pre-condition wherein Russell's husband promised to repair the damage caused by a 1995 hail storm. The claims for repair was far in excess of those provided for in the lease which were the tenant's responsibility._____ HELD: 1)The landlord was entitled to a writ of possession since the tenants were in breach of the covenant to pay rent for more than two calendar months. 2)A trial of the issue was ordered to determine whether the tenants were in breach of covenants in the lease. The matter should not be decided summarily where there are questions of fact or law. The hail damage may allow the tenants to claim in damages against the landlord but it could not be construed as a debt due for the purposes of s27 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The remaining alleged breaches could not be determined summarily.  3)Costs of the application were awarded to the landlord in any event of the cause.","The landlord applied for an order for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The applicants had entered a lease with the landlords in 1995 with the intent to rent and maintain suitable insurance. The tenants had not paid rent for more than two months and were in arrears of rent by more than 2 months. HELD: A trial of the issue was directed to determine whether the respondents were in breach of the covenants of their lease as alleged with respect to the demised premises and to use and occupy a good husband like manner. The respondents admitted the payment due May 1998 was not made because, they allege, Russell has breached the lease(clause 5.2) and because there was a failure on the part of the tenants to maintain proper weed control. A writ of possess in accordance with Form C of the Act may issue with costs to the applicant in any event of the cause. Where there are questions of fact or law, the matter should not be decided summarily but should be decided in an action (Vogelgesang and Kennedy v. Williams) as it is a matter of course.

3_2000skqb75.txt,"The applicant sought to vary the 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing spousal support of $2,500 per month. The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP. Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed. HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.  2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension. 3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions. However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home. She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property. The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge). There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs.","The applicant applied to vary a February 1, 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing his obligation to pay further spousal support. The amount he was required to pay under the 1995 judgment was $2,500 per month. The application was triggered by the applicant's loss of employment and a debilitating leg injury. HELD: 1)It was significant that the agreement reached by the parties in 1995 did not provide for a material change in circumstances. The applicant had retired and had no intention to become re-employed. It was essential that he know now what his future obligations were.  2)The applicant had met the threshold for a variation application by demonstrating that there had been amaterial change in circumstance. Although this entitles him to have the Court review his obligation pursuant to s.15.2 of the Divorce Act, rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self-sufficiency, it does not follow that his obligation should be terminated. There is no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. It is clear that the parties had contemplated retirement and the financial consequences that it would have for each of them. 3)The parties had three children. The respondent understandably did not work during the marriage and was not required to seek employment. However, she was economically disadvantaged to a greater degree than the applicant. She suggested that the applicant could also supplement his income by selling his residence and purchasing some form of annuity. 4)Costs were awarded in the amount of $1,250."
c_2002skqb47.txt,"FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store. The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43. The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused. The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to. The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party. 2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages. 3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value. Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. Expenses of each was examined separately. In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant. 4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee. A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court. It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant. Costs payable by the plaintiff on an interlocutory application may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs.","FIAT. An application to determine the issue of costs. The defendant sought to have the costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's second counsel was experienced and the plaintiff requested that her costs be reduced. Her costs were reduced by 15 percent when failed claims for punitive and exemplary damages were treated as separate causes. The medical report charge was not allowed. 2) Expert medical evidence was of marginal value to the Court since the plaintiff did not suffer from any mental disorder. Her pain could only be attributed to physical factors. The amount expended by party for investigating or in gathering evidence to either advance claim or defend it may actually exceed the value of the claim. 3) Taxable court costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. An expert medical evidence fee is allowed at 50 percent of the first counsel fee. 4) Costs in the discretion of the Court may be reduced by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. The expert medical witness expenses are to be taxed at 50% of the 1% reduction in Tariff used by the parties. 5) The defendant would not permit the plaintiff to file medical practitioners' reports without calling the doctors for cross-examination purposes. Questions as to what effect pain disorder had on the plaintiff and when that pain disorder first occurred were major matters.  6) An eight year old girl claimed damages for ankle injury and for a pain disorder developed as a result of the ankle injury. Her family physician referred to the guidelines laid down in Electronic Superstore Ltd. v. Geransky Brothers Construction (1991), 90 Sask. R. 150 (Q.B.), for determining whether to allow all or part of expert witness charges. The services of the expert were reasonably necessary as part of the case of the party at trial; 2) Costs were not disproportionate to the judgment and the services were not incurred to increase his level of expertise; and 7) The costs were not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs such as this."
4_2004skqb516.txt,"The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search. The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid. That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2) The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued. The search was therefore warrantless. 3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair. 4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis. 5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.","Cst. Olberg, the search leader and designated exhibit handler, knocked on the door of the accused's residence loudly announcing his presence as police officer and after waiting approximately 2 minutes he and the accompanying officers and RCMP officers forced entry. The accused was not in the residence. Upon his arrest he was given copies of both search warrants issued pursuant to s. 487 of the Criminal Code and s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. After obtaining the warrants, Olberg carefully cut and pasted from the word processing facilities of his computer some of the information specific to the accused and the offences under investigation, as well as various forms for out-of-province endorsement or 'backing'. HELD: 1) The evidence satisfied the court that there was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The Court found that both the warrants as issued were invalid. The Code and CDSA Warrants were invalid because they did not comply with the requirements of the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. In consequence the seizure of the property from inside the dwelling and the vehicles and equipment seized from the surrounding premises are legal and valid. 2) The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not in these circumstances bear directly upon the validity of the warrant, is nevertheless commented upon because of the bearing that it may have upon any s. 24(2) Charter analysis that may need to be undertaken."
5_2011nspc8.txt,"The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea. He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son. The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography. Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed; the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault. The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation.","The accused applied to set aside his guilty plea to count #1, the sexual assault of his son. Factual Background The accused was arrested and charged with sexual assault and a sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and further that he had committed sexual assault on his son while watching pornography on a computer and while touching his son's penis. The Crown alleged that the offences occurred at the accused's home when his wife, the complainant's mother, was at work. The accused appeared in court without counsel or an interpreter. The matter was adjourned for election to October 29, 2008. The application was dismissed. The test in Nevin, supra, was not met and the accused was not persuaded that his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation to which he plead guilty nor his understanding that he, by his plea, was admitting to it did not change the Court's view of his knowledge of the facts."
b_1998canlii12364.txt,"The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult. The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue. The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult. The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989. The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court. The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision. It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court. Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges. If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth. The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.  2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application. R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.","The primary issue on this appeal was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in a youth court where it is alleged that the offences occurred when the accused was either a young person or an adult. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging that the same offences had occurred when he was an adult.(1) The Court considered the effects of the transition from the Juvenile Delinquents Act to the Young Offenders Act and in particular s.79(4) in R. v. B.(K). It was common ground that youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to any offences which occurred prior to the date of their commission. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court judge is set aside and the matter remitted to youth court to be heard according to law. In the circumstances, either party may apply for an order under s.16 of the Act to decide the proper forum to hear the charges. 1) There are a number of pre-requisites which must be satisfied before a youth judge can order a transfer hearing. Section 16(1) provides that an application for transfer hearing must be made prior to 'adjudication'. The Crown, after a complete investigation, is unable to determine whether the alleged offences occurred during a period of time which includes in 1985, 1983, 1985, 1986, 1989, and 1989. The accused is therefore charged with these offences. The Court reviewed the various types of transfer hearings held in recent years and found that the most appropriate forum would be the Youth Court in Ontario. 2) The Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge was not required to assume jurisdiction for the transfer hearing as he was not an adult on the basis of declining jurisdiction.  3) The trial judge did not meet the onus of establishing a conflict between the competing interests, rehabilitation of the youth and public interest, such that the court would give precedence to the public interest. 4) Pre-disposition reports were provided by the Court."
d_2010skqb173.txt,"The petitioner and respondent are the parents of twins. The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order. The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent. The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner. The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children. The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis. The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come. The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children. HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement. The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order. The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased. The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed. The respondent was awarded costs.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to vary the consent parenting judgment and the consent child support order. The parties were the parents of twins, born August 28, 2005. The petitioner went on maternity leave from her position at the Calder Centre in Saskatoon. She then relocated to Regina to be with her family where the children were born. The respondent as single parent was able to access family supports after the twins were born in Regina. However, the petitioner has increased costs now that he has the children 50% of the time. The only change is the petitioner's income which has increased by $22,479. That in no way indicates a material change of circumstance. The court dismissed the application."
7_2001skqb10.txt,"The divorce action was based on separation for more than a year.  In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)Divorce was granted. The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998. 2)They agreed to joint custody of both children. The son was to reside primarily with his father. The daughter resided with her mother. Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends. The children were to be together most weekends. School vacations would be shared. 3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance. Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense. The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance. 4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003. The mother's job advancement was impeded as a result of the marriage, specifically by frequent moves to accommodate her husband's job transfers. She had worked out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing. 5)The parties agreed the matrimonial home would be sold and proceeds divided equally after payment of expenses of the sale. Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale. The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.  6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage. It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000. The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded. The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000. All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition. RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover. 7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75. The respondent was to assume any debts.  8)No costs were awarded.","An action for divorce based on separation. The issues were custody, access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of the matrimonial home and the division of property. HELD: 1)Access was to be reciprocal on alternate weekends from Friday evening until Sunday evening with the objective that the children be together with the same parent on most weekends. This was in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The test was whether division at the date of the petition would lead to an unfair and inequitable result so as to require compilation at a different date. 1)The respondent was ordered to convey one-half of the commuted value of $21,804.38 to a locked-in RRSP in the name of the petitioner and to designate the children as beneficiaries of his life insurance for a period of time as determined by the Pension Benefits Act.  2)The petitioner was not earning enough from her part-time employment to contribute other than nominally to the support of the husband. Maintenance for the parties' two children, aged 5 and 6 years, was reviewed by the Court in the meantime on the ordinary ground of material change in circumstances.  3)Spousal support was reduced to $900 per month payable the first day of each month commencing December 31, 1999.  4)The parties had reached agreement on some of the issues and substantial agreement on others. The petitioner was awarded leave to apply for clarification on this issue.  5)The Court was not prepared to grant an order for a time-limited award for no more than 3 years. The parties had tried hard to minimize the negative impact of the breakup of their marriage on their children. They had agreed to share the children's time during school vacations."
2006nssc158.txt,"The parties, who were the parents of two children, separated after a seven year marriage. For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis. In the divorce proceeding, the mother, who planned to remarry and relocate, sought to become the primary caregiver of the children, with the father to have access only every second weekend. The father sought to vary the parenting time so that both parents would equally share their time with the children. Current parenting arrangement to remain in effect with the parties retaining joint custody of the children; table amount of child support set. The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base.","The court granted the divorce on the grounds that there had been a breakdown of the marriage and the spouses had been living separate and apart for more than a year. The parties agreed to joint custody of their children and that the child support payments would remain in effect. The mother sought to vary the parenting time so that she and the father would equally share their time with the children. The father argued that the current arrangement was detrimental to the children's academic or social life. In his application for divorce, the mother indicated that she intended to remarry and relocate and sought to have the father's access to take place every second weekend. She also sought a clause preventing the removal of the children from the general area and for the father to pay child support by paying a table amount in accordance with his income and by making a contribution of $100 to the child care cost. HELD: The current parenting arrangements have been in place for five years. The current arrangements are working and there is no evidence to support a conclusion that a change is necessary nor would improve the parent/child relationship.  1)The father has been paying a party $800 per month since their separation to provide child care of their two children. This expense continues and is reasonable and necessary. 2)It would be in the best interest for the children to have regular access on a weekly basis with the rotation taking place on Sunday evening. Spousal support would not be appropriate in this circumstance. 3)The parents agreed to share child care expenses with the father. There had not been any suggestion that this routine was harmful to them. There was no evidence presented to show that this was so. 4)The court acknowledged that the father had some extracurricular activities that would create a distinctiveness to his children's time with them. They had, to a degree, a home base."
2_2009nssc364.txt,"The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008. It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time. At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).","The parties married in 1995 and separated in 2006. They have four children, all of whom are now in a shared parenting arrangement. In 2008, the parties entered a separation agreement which provided for shared parenting. The petitioner now seeks to have the spousal and child support obligations reflected in a paragraph of their separation agreement changed in as much as he seeks a corollary relief judgment that would not contain this obligation. The principal basis for the petitioner's argument is (1) a significant reduction in his income and (2) a loss of income tax deductibility for his payment under clause 9 of the separation agreement because he is no longer in a'shared parenting arrangement'. The petitioner argues (i) that the agreement was fairly negotiated and reflected the support objectives set out in the Divorce Act, as well as the overarching objectives of finality and certainty to enable the parties to move on with their lives; and (ii) whether anything outside the parties' reasonable contemplation had occurred since the date of the agreement to undermine the integrity of the settlement. HELD: The petitioner was ordered to pay $2,000 per month as combined child/spousal support plus $1,000 for the child support reviewed in accordance with the Corollary Relief judgment.  1) There was no suggestion the parties did not enter a binding agreement or that they were not binding at the time it was entered. 2) The petitioner had suffered a dramatic drop in income and was no longer living with the respondent. 3) The parties' income for the last three years has taken a dramatic and unanticipated drop. The court is concerned with the second branch of the test."

The accused was charged on July 3, 2003 with common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code, threatening to use weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Code, and destroying property of value less than $5,000 contrary to s. 430(4) of the Code. On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court. The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources. On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004. HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed. 1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months. This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights (the Charter) on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. There was no Charter breach. The accused did not contribute to the delay. He appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charge set for trial. Actions of the Crown were not involved. The remaining delay of six months was either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. The Crown argued that the restrictive condition in the undertaking preventing him from drinking alcohol has caused him actual prejudice because he has been charged with, pleaded guilty to and is sentenced for, three intervening offences of breaching his undertaking. HELD: The accused was found not to have suffered actual prejudice and that the conditions of his release were noterous as to result in any significant prejudice. The Court found no actual or inferred prejudice. This is a charge so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence (see R. v. Robillard [2000] S.J. No. 345). The six-month delay in relation to the July 5, 2003 not guilty plea was entered and trial date was set for May 6, 2004.

c_1996canlii6728.txt,"Issues included the division of a pension, child and spousal support and whether to transfer or have sold the matrimonial home which had a small equity. The petitioner was an undischarged bankrupt and any funds in his possession belonged to the trustee. The only marital asset of any value was the petitioner's pension but lump sum payment was not available for five years as there was a liquidity problem. The parties had been 'spenders' not 'savers'. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support for one child. 2)Spousal support was denied. 3)The matrimonial home was to be sold and proceeds were to be divided equally.  4)Three values were suggested for valuation and distribution of the pension plan. The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method. The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP. The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP. The respondent was to make the choice between the only two options. If she wished to have the funds in her name immediately, she was to provide written notification otherwise there would be an order that the respondent is to receive a portion when the monthly pension benefit commences.","The issues were division of the petitioner's pension, the quantum of child support and spousal support and whether the matrimonial home should be transferred to the respondent or sold and the proceeds of the marriage divided. The petitioner had already reached the earliest eligible retirement date but had not retired; the husband was an undischarged bankrupt. HELD: 1)The pension plan administrator determined that the retirement method of calculating the value of the pension would be the fairest as it would not reduce the spouse's commuted value to less than 50% of the member's commuting value prior to the division. 2)The petitioner was employed throughout the marriage and continued to be so employed. The parties were'spenders' not'savers'. Through the circumstances of the debts and the husband's bankruptcy, the pension plan was divided equally. 3)The wife was to pay child support of $260 per month for 12 months until Ryan was a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.3(2nd Supp.) and $331,100 to the husband. 4)The parties' primary asset was the police pension and it was their only source of income. The court determined that no child support was payable in respect of Chad since the marriage ended in 1996. 5)The court ordered the husband to pay $350 per month as child support for the child and $330 per month thereafter for so long as he was a full-time student at a recognized educational institution for a reasonable period following completion of high school.

c_2013skqb180.txt,"The parties had a shared parenting arrangement since separation where each party parented their four-year-old child for equal times in a two-week cycle, the petitioner parenting in her home in Moose Jaw and the respondent parenting in his parent's home in Regina. The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school. Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent. The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application. The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents. The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child. The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make. HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child. The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent. The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents. The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's. Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan. The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain. The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina. The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime. The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend. The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays. The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two. The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year. Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days. The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement.","HELD: The court held that the parents could not resolve the custody issue and defer to the court to determine where the child would attend school. The court found that the child was doing well in pre-school and would be better off without the parents. The parents had separated in 2009 and had shared parenting on a two-week cycle. The child was to commence school on a regular basis in September. The inevitable decision as to where Madison will attend school was imminent. The children were to have one place to go to school, one school one place that was her own."

In 2012 SKQB 543, the Court ordered production of the records. This decision deals with whether the documents should be produced to the accused. HELD: The documents were disclosed to the accused. The judge vetted the documents to black out words, phrases or numbers that have no probative value or where the privacy interest of the witness would have been unjustifiably affected.","HELD: The Court granted the application. It found that disclosure was necessary for the accused to make full answer and defence; the nature and extent of the reasonable expectation of privacy; whether production of the record would be premised upon any discriminatory belief or bias; [and] (5) the potential prejudice to the complainant's dignity, privacy or security of the person that would be occasioned by production of a record in question. The Court also found that the third party records in the 'true relevancy' of the targeted record in the case were the police reports and witness statements, including statements of the accused, in respect of two Crown witnesses, namely, the alleged victims of the aggravated assaults, Robert Lowenberger and Kelly Charbonneau, and in particular offences for which these two individuals have previously been convicted. The accused's interest in obtaining disclosure for the purpose of making full Answer and defence will outweigh any residual privacy interest held by third parties in the material.

d_2011skqb62.txt,"The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon. The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon. The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed. The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon. The Crown appeal was dismissed.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the accused on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon contrary to s. 90 of the Criminal Code. The Crown appeals on the grounds that the learned trial judge misapprehended the evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The Crown's appeal is dismissed. The trial judge properly placed the accused's evidence in the context of the issues she had to address. 1) The Crown argues that the sword should have been found by the trial judge to be a prima facie weapon, in the same manner that a firearm, or brass knuckles or other inherently dangerous items are considered weapons. On this basis, sword would be distinguished from knife, which is not necessarily weapon. 2) There is nothing to show that the knife in question was designed to be used as a weapon: when it is closed, it is as innocuous as any other piece of decorative or decorative item. When it is not properly tucked into his shorts, he tucked it in his shorts. As he did not have a specific reason for buying the sword, he was not testifying as to his eye witness perceptions but about the sword and where it could be purchased. One must start with the premise that a knife, being an instrument that is universally used for utilitarian, peaceful purposes is not prima Facie a weapon, that is to say, in warfare, fighting, or combat to overcome an enemy in attack or defence. 3) With regard to the first issue, whether the accused either used or intended to use the sword for the purposes enumerated in the definition, namely: (a) in causing death or injury to any person, or (b) for the purpose of threatening or intimidating, which are weapons, the Crown submits that the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence and seeks conviction on the charge. The accused was acquitted of the charge of possession of a weapon by a person other than a knife. 4) Although probative, the evidence must be excluded by clear ground of policy or of law."

The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years. The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","The plaintiffs sued the defendants pursuant to Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules for damages arising to them from alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd. The plaintiffs' home was adjacent to one another and abut the ninth hole of the golf course. The defendants' golf course was designed and built in the late 1980s without any residential development adjacent to it. During the peak season, the golf balls roll under the fence, but many of these balls are hard driven and as result the plaintiffs have sustained extensive damage to their homes, their vehicles and on other occasions the balls have narrowly missed hitting workmen and guests in the yard. HELD: 1) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which has continued for the past nine years.  2) The defendant is liable to all of the plaintiffs in negligence for the failure over the past years to remedy or eliminate this hazardous and dangerous situation.  3) The Court is not prepared to order the specific course of action that the defendants should take in order to remedy the problem."
2000skca99.txt,"See also 150 SaskR 185.In 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's sentence appeal and appeal of his 1997 convictions which consisted primarily of sexual offences involving family members and others. The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years. The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal. The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision. HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted. 1)The application was premature. The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months. The Court of Appeal was not satisfied the appeal as a whole was not frivolous having regard for the requirements of s.679(3)(a) and (c). Some grounds for appeal would clearly fail such as the ground the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess on the basis of the incomplete material before the court. 2)His continued detention was necessary in the public interest having regard for the whole of the circumstances. His release would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.","The applicant was convicted of several sexual offences, consisting in the main of sexual offences involving members of his family and others close to him. He then appealed against his convictions, and the Crown appealed against their sentence. On September 16, 1998, this Court dismissed his appeal against conviction and allowed the Crown's appeal, increasing the sentence from five to ten years. In the meantime the applicant wanted to be released from custody. He also sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court on one or two of the comparatively stronger grounds and to appeal on a further issue concerning corroboration. HELD: The application for release was premature. The Court was not satisfied that the prospective appeal as a whole was not frivolous and that the applicant's continued detention for the time being was not necessary in the public interest. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess in their entirety, given the material before them. On the basis of that material, which is incomplete, it was not convinced the grounds relied upon had sufficient merit to satisfy the requirements of s.679(3)(a) of the section. Turning to the wider public interest, the issue of whether the applicant should be released would be of particular concern given the history of the past proceedings, the current state of the present proceedings and the likelihood of the applicant succeeding either in having all of the convictions set aside or in having the sentence reduced to the time already served."
2_2001nssc164.txt,"The applicant applied for an order directing the removal of a ground sign which violated its' Municipal Planning Strategy and Land Use By-laws. The respondents argued that the applicant's by-law violated their rights under s. 2(b) of the Charter. Application allowed; respondents directed to remove the ground sign; if the sign is not removed within fifteen days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. Although advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of sec. 2(b) of the Charter, the purposes of the by-laws (maintaining a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown, minimizing adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reducing safety concerns) were both pressing and substantial and the limiting measures were rationally connected to the objectives. The by-laws had a minimal impairment on the rights of the respondents, as advertising was not prohibited but only limited.","The Town applied pursuant to s266 of the Municipal Government Act for the removal of a ground sign erected in the Town's downtown core zone. The by-laws prohibited the erection of signs without a permit and stipulated that a sign had to relate to the property on which it was located. The Town contended the by-law infringed its Charter rights since it was a third party sign which did not prevent advertising but only limits it. The Respondents sought to remove the sign. Application allowed; order to issue if not removed within 15 days the sign can be removed at the expense of the respondents; costs will be awarded at $1,500 against all respondents. The application was allowed and an order was made under s266 to permit anyone to ignore the requirement for certification on the basis of a religious conviction; the limiting measures of the bylaw were rationally connected to the objective and effectively addressed unrestricted use of available space in a way that maximizes the effective use of signs; the primary objectives of the By-laws were to reduce the proliferation of billboard advertisement and to prevent distraction to motor vehicles; and to minimize the adverse impacts of signs on adjacent properties and the street scape. Restrictions on the respondents' freedom of expression and freedoms guaranteed by s.2(b) of the Charter are demonstrably justified, and are justified in a free and democratic society. The Court of Appeal stated that there can be no doubt that in an urban industrial society, regulation of land use to ensure the health, welfare and general well-being of the inhabitants is of primary importance. Regulation of land-use in an industrial society is of paramount importance. It is obvious that in a municipality it is desirable, if not necessary, to regulate the erecting of signs. The alternative is a potential chaos and visually unappealing community. A proportionality test has to be applied to determine the extent to which the limiting measure has been sufficiently justified and proportionate to the infringement of the appellant's right of freedom of speech. The common law prohibits the use of arbitrarily large number of signs with certain restrictions upon size in specific areas in accordance with its objectives. The restrictions regulate how and where the signs can be placed and does not prevents advertising, but only limited it."

The issue had been settled by the decision in Regina Exhibition.

Because of disputes over ownership between the plaintiffs and the defendant, the latter commenced an action against the plaintiffs seeking declaration as to the validity of the tax sale. The Municipality later sued the plaintiffs for general damages resulting in the plaintiff taking possession of the property. The plaintiff winterized the property leaving it 'as it always did'. Legal costs incurred at the first trial were set forth at $39,385.82. The Court of Appeal apportioned liability between the Municipality and the Director of Assessment at 50% each. The present action is by the defendants in that first case to recover its legal fees together with some other items of loss and general damages. The plaintiffs claim a series of items of damage to the property alleged to have occurred while they were out of possession. The damages alleged may very well have been caused by vandalism or would have occurred in any event to a property left vacant through winter months. The grounds for the reversal was that such damage as claimed occurred and did so when the plaintiffs were in possession and the defendants must be held responsible. The defendant brought an action for legal fees in the face of the decision in the Attorney General's v. Maclnnes et al, which overturned the trial division basically on the grounds that the legal fees were too remote and unforeseeable for the plaintiff in that action, as well as in the same action, which failed."

Duce Oil denies liability for any costs of the horizontal well in excess of $447,535 being 110% of the authorization for expenditure executed with respect to the Well. The defendant counterclaimed on the basis the plaintiff conducted certain operations without authority, was negligent in conducting operations and overcharged or made improper charges in its accounting procedures. HELD: 1)Duce was liable for $96,286.95 representing 35% of the unpaid costs of the original and supplemental authorization for expenditures (AFE) and the costs of the screw pump. 2)Duce was responsible for $49,701.61 representing regular lifting and production costs and other joint interest wells plus expenditures under $25,000 which did not require an AFE. 3)Coachlight was only entitled to interest from the time of its written notice on June 20/94 that it was exercising its option under the CAPL 1981 to charge interest. 4)In default of payment within 90 days of Judgment the plaintiff would be entitled to a builders' lien in the entire estate or interest of the defendant in all petroleum, natural gas and other hydrocarbons except coal and valuable stone, upon or under the lands as specified together with all proceeds from the defendant's interests in petroleum and natural gas and its interest in fixtures, machinery, tools, appliances and other property in any of the defendant's oil or gas wells on those lands. 5)The totality of the evidence did not support the portrayal by the defendant of the plaintiff as a high handed, arrogant operator who simply forgot it had a minority partner.  6)The plaintiff was entitled to its taxable costs.","The plaintiff invoiced the defendant for its share of the $681,955.58 costs associated with the Horizontal Well but the defendant refused to pay the whole amount. The plaintiff sought an order requiring the defendant to pay $49,701.61 representing 35% of the regular lifting and production costs of all joint interest wells under the Operating Agreement and a declaration that it holds a builders' lien against the defendant's interest in the Well and other joint interest assets to the extent of the debts due.

Costs in excess of $1,000,000 were awarded to the defendant. The court relied primarily on Clause 301 of Article III and the third paragraph of Clause 301 for the authorization for the drilling of the second leg. It found that the defendant conducted certain operations without authority, was negligent in conducting operations or did it otherwise make improper charges in its accounting procedures. At the material time, the defendant never suggested that the parties pause to consider stopping at leg one. As the plaintiff was not prepared to accept surrender and quit claim in full and the proceeds of sale of the sale of such Joint-Operator shares were divided among the defendant, it was not able to recover costs from the plaintiff. As most of the outstanding costs in the original AFE were from the joint-operator's sale of crude oil, the court found that both parties agreed that a horizontal well was not contemplated by the Original AFE and thus the defendant was not responsible for any of the costs related to that."
6_2003skqb61.txt,"FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate. Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not. To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).","FIAT: This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year-old mother was opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of a bond. HELD: 1) This is a routine application by siblings, who are most usually the applicants, and to consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for filing a bond contained in s. 55(1). Almost every application would so qualify because in most cases the nearest relatives and public trustee consent in writing would do so. 2) The applicant did not have adequate assets to administer the estate. The four children who were not applicants consent to the application without a necessity of bond. 3) The application to be appointed personal decision making-makers is in order and an order may issue with the authorities identified in the draft order submitted. Leave is granted to the applicants to supplement the existing material should they see fit to do so; consulting with the public trustee in advance will eliminate significant costs for the applicants in having to litigate every application with the Public trustee."
6_1999canlii12377.txt,"A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second. Two passengers were knocked unconscious. One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty. His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances. The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield. The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision. It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.  1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3). The right of way, however, is not absolute. As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor. It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on. Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor. Alcohol was not a factor. Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights. 3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","This was a charge of failing to yield contrary to s. 50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The defendant had stopped at an intersection for 15 seconds to allow several south-bound vehicles to go by, and then began his left turn. The plaintiff's passenger was knocked unconscious and received cut to the head requiring three or four stitches. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty on all of the charges.  1)It would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as he was required to do so. Visibility was reasonably good, given the time of day and the fact that the intersection was lit by street lights. Traffic was light when the defendant made his turn. It may well have been that the defendant through the exercise of higher degree of vigilance may have seen the oncoming Tempo. 2)The defendant was entitled to assume that it was safe to proceed as there did not appear to be any other vehicles close enough to the intersection to present a hazard. The vehicle probably approached and entered the intersection too fast for the defendant to take appropriate evasive action. This vehicle may also have had only parking lights on."
c_2007skqb269.txt,"FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school. They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed. HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case. 1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case. The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity. There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council. There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided. No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election. The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding. The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made. To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process. 2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair. A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter.","FIAT: The applicants seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing and restraining the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution passed by the Board on May 7, 2007 that the Wilcox Public School be closed effective August 15, 2007. The grounds for the application are that the Board provided inadequate notice of an election for the Wilco school community council and it is alleged the election is nullity. As result there was no council for the Board to consult with as required by The Education Act, 1995. A preliminary review of the facts and law does not suggest a strong prima facie case."
2_2004skqb62.txt,"FIAT: The issue to be resolved was whether the petitioner had produced all relevant financial information in order for the Court to determine the amount of maintenance to be paid by her. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs in the amount of $500 to the petitioner. Neither the petitioner's father nor the petitioner's husband was a party to the proceedings. To require them to produce their financial records, in the absence of even the slightest evidence such production would disclose anything which would in any manner assist in determining the amount of child maintenance payable by the petitioner, would be totally unjust.","FIAT. When the 1999 judgment was amended to provide that the primary residence of the child should be with her father, the question of the payment of maintenance by the mother was adjourned pending fulfilment of the requirement that she produce all information relating to her ability to pay maintenance and for her examination by the respondent to determine her income. HELD: The examination was completed and by agreement of counsel the questions to be resolved were whether the mother had produced all relevant financial information, and whether a trial should be directed as to the amount of maintenance payable by her. Neither counsel for the respondent nor the petitioner had canvassed the financial records of the numbered corporation, owned by the petitioner's husband, to be disclosed. Counsel for Mr. Overs also sought financial information pertaining to the ranching operation where the petitioner looked after the cattle while the father was operating the truck. Counsel provided no evidence to support the assertion that the petitioner should be required to produce any of the company's financial records. Whether the petitioner could have canvassed for the records would be of no assistance because the parties could not afford to pursue such a course. Whether a trial would be appropriate because of the conflicting assertions of the petitioner and the respondent that they were engaged in farming and cattle operation with the petitioner would not be of any assistance because neither counsel would have the slightest interest in canvassing the premises of the respondent in the absence of the court hearing.  1) The respondent would not have the benefit of a trial of the issue if it was ordered on the basis of the mother's failure to produce all of the financial information available to him. The parties could ill afford such expense and they would be poorly advised to pursue that course.  2) The petitioner did not have any business in the cattle operation or the farming operation. The respondent's assertions that she was not engaged in any sort of farming operation were not supported by the facts as they were not canvassed by her or the petitioner in any way other than by counsel's fees. The Court would be unable to find anything which would assist in determining her income beyond the amount revealed in her income tax returns.  3) Counsel's fees would be enhanced because counsel would need to enhance counsels' fees.  4) The application for the calculation of child maintenance was returned to the Chamber list for March 8, 2004."

One month prior to the preliminary hearing, defence counsel requested that the accident reconstructionist be made available as witness. The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission. The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing. HELD: The defence request for an adjournment was granted. The Court could not be satisfied that the officer was not a material witness to the preliminary inquiry. The Court was not satisfied that defence was guilty of neglect in failing to procure the officer's attendance when they had been advised by the Crown that he was out of the country. The length of the adjournment would not be lengthy.","The accused was charged with committing an offence under s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code and knowing or ought to have known that his operation of the motor vehicle caused an accident resulting in bodily harm to another person. After the Crown called all of their witnesses, asked Defence Counsel if they had any witnesses to call on the preliminary inquiry. Defence Counsel advised that they had one witness they wished to call but required an adjournment as that witness was not available to testify on this date. The Crown opposed the adjournment request. HELD: The Court was satisfied that the Defence was guilty of neglect in procuring the attendance of the first witness and that there was a reasonable expectation that he could be called as a witness. The Court granted the Defence request for adjournment so that they could make the necessary arrangements to call the second witness, as well as the Crash Data Retrieval Information, as requested by the Crown.  1) Unlike at trial, justice conducting preliminary inquiry has no power to direct Crown counsel to call certain witnesses, the Crown has an unfettered discretion to call whatever witnesses it requires. 2) When the Defence is advised that Sergeant Barbar is halfway around the world on a peace keeping mission in the middle of a war zone, do not think that they are negligent in not going to the trouble and expense of preparing a subpoena that could not be effectively served on him in any event. 3) The Crown has not committed to not calling Sergeant Barbar at the preliminary hearing as an indication that they viewed his evidence as important. The Defence has not indicated that it will call any other witness who is not available at this time."
e_2014skpc35.txt,"The Crown found the accused not guilty. With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address. The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary. Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence. There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 259(4) of the Criminal Code. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The only evidence was that an in-court identification was not necessary; there was no evidence that proper notice had been given of the two documents tendered by the Crown and service on a lawyer did not satisfy the notice requirement. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1)A person was lawfully arrested, detained and released on an Appearance Notice by the arresting officer. That Appearance Notice forms part of the court record and purports to be signed by the accused. On the date specified on that notice, the accused was not present but his counsel appeared, waived reading of the allegation, entered a not guilty plea and scheduled a date for trial. This constitutes prima facie proof of identity and there is no doubt whatsoever that the person named on the Appearance Notice is the same person who has stood trial. 2)The Certificate of Disqualification or Prohibition was not admissible. The Court was referred to authorities to the effect that the Crown failed to establish that the accused had been disqualified or prohibited from driving and the accused is acquitted. 3)Section 260(6) does not apply to any proceedings unless at least 7 days notice in writing is given to the accused that it is intended to tender the Certificate in evidence. The Certificate of Prohibition is never admissible and the Certificate of Intention to Tender is never tender. There is no evidence before the Court as to the nature of the disqualification or if there is any Charter violation asserted."
e_1999skqb106.txt,"FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","The plaintiffs sued the defendants based on allegations that one or more of the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless helicopter shuttle operation to and from the work site. The plaintiff alleged the defendants knew the helicopters were unsafe and that they could not avoid liability by reason of having hired an independent contractor. The defendant denied having hired the independent contractor and asserted that all documentation, including internal reports, records of interviews and documentation with respect to the helicopter transport and crash was to be made available to legal counsel for advice and instruction. The independent contractor defence claimed that such information was not relevant to the plaintiffs' allegations that the helicopter shuttle service was inherently dangerous. The court found that by disclosing the theories, it is easier to determine whether such questioning is or could be logically relevant to a fact or position in issue. The plaintiffs' wish to explore theory that cost was a major consideration in the defendants' continued use of Kyrgyzstan National Air as a shuttle service is not accepted. The questions related to the e-mail system are properly answerable. The only significance of the plaintiffs identifying the theories they may hold behind any questioning of the issues raised by such pleadings is that by identifying the theory in answer to an objection on the basis of relevance, the plaintiffs can determine whether the question as broadly relevant to an issue in the present situation is relevant and prima facie admissible."
d_2003nssf2.txt,"The applicant commenced a divorce action against her husband incorporating a claim for a division of assets under the Matrimonial Property Act. The Ontario Court had previously granted a consent order incorporating an agreement between the parties purporting to divide matrimonial assets. The applicant sought to set aside the agreement on the grounds of unconscionability, harshness or fraud. The court has jurisdiction to vary the agreement on the grounds alleged notwithstanding that the Act does not specifically provide the court with jurisdiction .","The respondent commenced an action for divorce against the respondent on the grounds that she was not aware of her entitlement to share in her husband's pension benefits at the time she entered into the agreement. The respondent also sought a division of assets under the Matrimonial Property Act. In the action, the respondent seeks to set aside the agreement she made with the respondent and seek to have it set aside. At issue was whether the Nova Scotia court has jurisdiction to hear the respondent's claim for divorce and her claim for division of property under the matrimonial property act. A consent order is a contract and must be treated as such. It can only be set aside or varied by subsequent consent, or upon grounds of common mistake, misrepresentation or fraud, or on any other ground which would invalidate contract. Deliberations: 1) as agreed by the parties, there is no question that the respondent is entitled to commence the divorce action in Nova Scotia. She is also entitled to seek divisionof assets under s. 29 of the province. The Divorce Act has provided for jurisdictional difficulties arising because of the increased mobility of the population in Canada and is therefore an appropriate forum for this application. 2) Notwithstanding that s.29 does not specifically provide the court with jurisdiction, the Court has the jurisdiction to vary a consent order pursuant to the terms of its own order."
b_1999canlii12440.txt,"In the first application under the Family Maintenance Act the father sought to reduce child maintenance of $250 per child per month to an amount in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines; cancellation of arrears of $13,273.39; and increased access. In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck. HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.  2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears. Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997. The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997. Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times. Upon payment of $5,000 the balance of arrears accrued prior to December 31/98 would be extinguished. 3)The father was to pay child support of $325 per month for the two children. Garnishment of his wages by the Maintenance Enforcement Office were to be limited to $175 per month for arrears plus the current maintenance due. 4)The parties agreed the father should have access not less than one full weekend per month upon two weeks prior notice plus when he was available to attend at the city in a manner consistent with the children's best interests and their need to be available for school.","Two applications before the Court under the Family Maintenance Act s.10 seeking an order providing for the following relief: 1) Variation of child maintenance payable pursuant to the 1993 order by reducing the maintenance payable thereunder from $250 per month for each of the three children to the amounts specified under the Federal Child Support Guidelines as adopted by The Act; and 2) Cancellation of the arrears of $13,273.39 in maintenance payments accrued under the order as of December 31, 1998.  3) The petitioner was not in a position to pay full monthly maintenance provided by the order. She applied by notice motion with appropriate supporting affidavits. 4) The respondent was not prepared to hear her application and advised her to apply by affidavit evidence."
d_2001nssc18.txt,"The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave. The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.","The grievor was a member of the respondent union and had been employed at the time of the grievance in the front desk department of the hotel. She filed a grievance complaining that her hours were reduced because another employee with greater departmental seniority returned from maternity leave. The arbitrator found that the wording of Article 9:01 was wide enough to encompass the situation and that the person with the least hotel seniority was the one who should have their hours reduced, not me. The employer brought this application for judicial review pursuant to s15(2) of the Arbitration Act. HELD: The appeal was granted on the basis that the arbitrator’s finding was patently unreasonable and was outside the jurisdiction of the employer. The court ordered the interpretation of the clause to be set aside and that judicial review be ordered.  1)The language of the Article was broadly consistent with that of the collective agreement and the fact that the reduction in work hours was indefinite did not result in a reduction in the total hours available for work in the department. 2)There was no attempt by the grievor to invoke it. The interpretation was clearly unreasonable and beyond the range of what an arbitrator could reasonably hope to achieve. The plain meaning of the threshold clause is that it refers to an indefinite reduction of hours within a department. Further, if the employee was out on an extended sick leave and her date of return was not clearly anticipated, should the Grievor be penalized upon her return? 3)This was not a lay-off situation. It was a situation where there had been an indefinite number of hours available to be assigned for work within the department, and therefore an anomalous result could occur. This was inconsistent with the presumed intention of the parties. 4)The court was unable to intervene simply because it disagreed with the reasoning of either arbitrator or its agreement with them."
b_2014skca82.txt,"The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed. The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony. The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed. The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous. The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial. The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial. The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial. Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondent from a charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to s. 249(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown was tried on this charge before judge alone and was acquitted on October 10, 2013. The respondent was acquitted of the charge. HELD: The Crown appeal is dismissed. 1) The Crown has failed to overcome the heavy onus required to overturn appeals from acquittals under s. 676(1)(a). 2) The trial judge correctly stated and applied the elements of the offence. 3) It is an error of law for the trial judge to mistake the facts for either the actus reus or the mens reus of the offences. However, he did not confuse an issue of fact—Mr. Alves' speed—with either of the two types of offence. In the circumstances, am not satisfied the Crown has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the speed of the accused's vehicle was anything more than 93 to 99 kilometres per hour or that it was objectively dangerous in the circumstances."
2001skqb148.txt,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","Three motions were brought under Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) and 188 to have the plaintiff's claim dismissed. The first motion was brought by the former police officer who had been charged in an information sworn in 1992 with serious criminal offences. He was arrested, detained in custody for 4 days and suspended from his employment as a police officer for 5 months. The Crown then entered a stay of proceedings which lasted 15 months. At that time, several parties were removed from the proceedings and an application was brought for an extension of the stay by the plaintiff. The defendants appealed. Allowing the appeal, that even though the applications were grounded in a limitation period, there still a factual component and absent an agreed statement of facts there should not be an order granted under Rule 188. With the consent of the plaintiff, the application to dismiss the claim was dismissed."
b_1996canlii5058.txt,"The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act. The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David. First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity. When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate. Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application. The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due. Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas. The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment. Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due. 5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose. It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation. There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.","Whether money owed under a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) is debt 'accruing due' under s. 5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act or subject to garnishment cannot be determined by reference only to garnishability of promissory notes not yet due. Other cases pertaining to similar debts must also be rationalized. Here, the conditional nature of the debt under the GIC was not a conditional one and therefore not garnishable."
e_2007skqb174.txt,"The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","The respondent applied to vary the original custody judgment, which provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The issues were whether the mother's failure to abide by the terms of the original judgment and refusal to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself or the child since the date of its original judgment had been grounds for the application. HELD: 1) The evidence confirmed each of the seven points outlined by the father in support of the proposed relocation. 2) There had been a material change in the circumstances when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties, which would be necessary, was possible for the father to relocate with the child to Whitehorse. 3) The respondent had taken the child out of the Province of Saskatchewan, and he also failed to notify the child's parents as to her whereabouts and prevented the father from exercising the shared parenting, which the Original Custody Judgment had ordered. Accordingly, the child was too young to take into account the views of both the mother and the father."
9_2004skqb324.txt,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","Walgreens applied for an order quashing two orders of the Board made pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing. The orders required Wal-Mart to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in a subpoena duces tecum. The order also required that the company comply with the discovery and production of documents sought by the UFCW. At issue was whether the Board has the jurisdiction to order the production of materials that are irrelevant to the issues that are properly before the Board; and whether it is unconstitutional and not protected by s.1(d) of the Charter. HELD: The order was quashed. 1)A review of the transcript is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2)The Board conceded that two exceptions to the general rule are that it cannot use a subpoena or make a disclosure and production order without considering the relevance of what is sought to be produced. 3)It is beyond the scope of this judgment to review and comment on the relevancy requirement. 4)The portions of the subpoena are rampant with opinion and argument. It is obvious that the Board did not address the plaintiff's concerns or objections in any meaningful fashion but in effect ignored them. 5)There are virtually no reasons given by the Board as to why it ordered each and every document, memo or communication sought by UFCW, except that it did not refer to it as a party to the application. The Board has incorporated the evidence into its orders within the exception outlined by Lord Denning.  6)Each party has a claim to a share in the value of the documents held in their possession or in the possession or knowledge of the representative witness for Wal- Mart Canada. They have the right to rely on that evidence in their submission to the Court. Counsel for the Board acknowledged the limited role of it on judicial review of one of its orders as outlined in CAIMAW v. Paccar of Canada Ltd. [1989] S.C.R. 982. 7) The portions would normally have been struck. However, they were replaced by new affidavits by counsel for UFCW on behalf of the Interested Parties. They submitted they had no desire to participate in the hearings and were requesting that the transcripts be read. They also submitted that they did not desire to be heard by the Court but that they were seeking a written decision respecting the contents of the affidavits. 8)The application for a declaration that"
b_1996canlii5628.txt,"The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years. As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation. The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages. He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages. Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months. Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified. Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears. Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.","The sales agent for Allstate was terminated as a result of a 2 year 'non-competition' clause in his employment contract which prohibited him from soliciting or selling insurance on behalf of the defendant. Allstate sought to justify the termination by arguing that since compensation is calculated in part on the basis of the prior month's sales, it would be a failure by the employee to mitigate his damages. Awarding the plaintiff one month's arrears in the amount of salary, that this is because Allstate had made little effort to secure alternative employment for the sales agent. The plaintiff had joined Allstate as a sales agent in 1965 and continued in its employ for approximately 26 years. There was, however, no month for which he had not been compensated. The trial judge based his conclusions on a misunderstanding as to the true nature of the terms of the compensation as between himself and Allstate, and on the fact that the arbitration clause was not relevant in determining the appropriate period of notice. The decision to terminate the plaintiff was based on a reasonable course of conduct, which was not unreasonable. The fact that Allstate did not pursue the possibility of alternative employment with enthusiasm or commitment, despite having received a pro-rated amount to November 5, 1991, when the termination of the plaintiff occurred, did not constitute a failure to mitigate the damages."

The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50). She alleged the husband was abusive. The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children. Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times). The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded. If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that. Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan. Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation. A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.","The parties had been in a relationship for approximately thirty years and had two children, ages 18 and 18. The wife requested an equal time shared parenting arrangement and alleged that the husband was abusive of her. The parties had little face to face communication and the wife frequently did not respond to the husband's reasonable requests involving the children. The husband requested that the children be placed in his sole care and custody, although the wife had indicated that she would not cooperate with his requests for the children's care. Joint custody of the children was granted, with all assets divided between the parties, and an order for joint custody granted where the children were to be parented with the husband for one week at a time, at which point all of the parenting responsibilities will be taken into account. Children do benefit from joint parenting because they will have the benefit of the expedience, knowledge and analysis provided by each parent. However, there is a potential for conflict between the parents. While shared parenting is appropriate, the children have been in the wife's care for approximately years. They have become familiar with the structure and routine he has put in place for them, and have become accustomed to the pattern of time when they are in her care. There is no evidence that the wife is unable to preform the basic parenting tasks. The evidence from the parties' shared custody arrangement does not support the conclusion that joint custody is in the best interest of these children. In fact, it may be a modest price to pay in order to preserve the child's confidence in the love of the parents and with it his own sense of security and self-esteem."

The hotel was convicted on one charge and the remaining charges were held in abeyance pending its appeal. The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges. Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The second ground raised a substantive issue and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth. There was nothing inconsistent with the Commission considering a form of disqualification of the applicant's license or permit, while the state exercises its criminal law power with respect to the same set of facts. 2)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing will not result in any new facts that were not already known to the Crown.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order staying the hearing until November to review a decision of the respondent Authority to suspend the applicant's 'tavern permit' for a period of 3 days, until criminal charges arising out of the same facts wereposed of. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)There was no obvious prejudice to the applicant in allowing the Commission's hearing to proceed, and certainly none was attested to. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing was not going to result in any new facts that were not already known to it. 2)The Commission was not relying on conviction. It will have the onus of adducing evidence related to the alleged breaches of s. 112(1) of the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act and presumably the defence will consist of denying one or more of the elements implicit in the allegations. There was nothing inconsistent with the respondent Commission's decision to consider a form of disqualification of the appellant's application if the Commissionhearing was allowed to take place as scheduled."

HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred. There was no unfairness in the trial process. The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer. 2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case. He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen. The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v. Romanowicz (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.).","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court found that the appellant had not suffered a miscarriage of justice as a result of the ineffective assistance of his non-lawyer agent on the assault charge. The Office of the Queen's Bench President was awarded $2,500 to represent the appellant at the criminal trial on the grounds that there was a miscarriageof justice arising from the conduct of the trial. The officer’s lack of ability by itself was not a ground for determining that a miscarriage occurred. There was no unfairness to the appellant in the trial process as he made his decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. The decision to not to testify was based on a strong recommendation of an experienced lawyer who was experienced and knowledgeable on the subject. The law in this area is well established and there is little reason to embark on further analysis of overturning the conviction on the basis of finding fact."

Clearly the maximum allowable probation period is 3 years and therefore the sentence imposed is unenforceable. The sentence imposed below is three years conditional. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conditional sentence affirmed with the conditions as originally ordered with an additional condition.

The respondent raised a preliminary objection, arguing that the matter should not proceed by way of judicial review but that the applicant should be restricted to an appeal of the Rentalsman's decision under s.49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, and that the applicant had failed to do so within the prescribed 30 day limit. The applicant argued that she never received any notice of proceedings making it impossible for her to appeal within 30 days. HELD: Preliminary objection dismissed. The court ordered that the application be returned to the Chamber's list for a hearing on the merits. Since there is nothing in the Act that allows the court to extend the time for filing an appeal, to deny the application for judicial review would deny the applicant an opportunity to pursue her only remedy in the circumstances.","This was an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664(1) and 674 for an order quashing a decision of the Office of the Rentalsman.

e_2006nssc364.txt,"The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle.","The plaintiff, who was pursuing a shoplifter, was run down in a cross walk in a mall parking lot by the van that was being used as the getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist. The plaintiff and his insurer, ING, agreed to pay $162,500 as an all inclusive sum. There were a number of credibility issues, principally regarding the identity of the vehicle, its owner and whether the driver had the owner's consent to operate the vehicle when the incident occurred. HELD: The plaintiff's evidence was replete with inconsistencies, contradictions, admitted poor memory and admitted lies in his earlier discovery evidence. The Court was unable to locate either of them.  1) Whether it was information he learned from the police or pure chance, it was only the next day that the plaintiff was driven by the 27 Prince Albert Road address and immediately recognized the van parked out front as the vehicle that had struck him the day before. He recognized it by the distinguishing features earlier mentioned and promptly called the police to pass on its location and license number. When the police came to the address and asked if the plaintiff knew who the driver was, he said that he didn't know, but that he had seen the driver sitting with his hands on the wheel looking straight ahead and appearing focused or mad. He also stated that he was investigating a hit and run incident. 2) The plaintiff suffered serious personal injuries mainly to his knee. His insurer, Allstate Insurance joined the proceeding as a third party under the provisions of s. 133(14) of the Insurance Act, R.S.N.S.(1989) ch. 231 whereby it is defending the action against its insured Jerome Thomas under reservation of rights. A fourth witness was called to testify on behalf of ING regarding the respondent's admission that he sold the van to the woman who supplied the drugs to him that night. The respondent admitted that he did not know the respondent at the time but had no idea she was the driver when she pulled the van out of the parking lot. She testified that during the relevant time frame she observed the appellant making a fraudulent return of merchandise at another store (which he had just picked up and wanted to 'exchange'). As she left the store, the plaintiff alerted the store personnel as to what had happened and they apprehended the appellant. The appellant was charged with several offences under the Motor Vehicle Act but his failure to appear in court resulted in the issuance of an Arrest Warrant.

At the onset of her trial, the accused took the position that her s. 8, s. 9 and s. 10 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all the evidence obtained after the stop should be excluded. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached. 1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest. 2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there. 3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.","The accused was charged with possession and use of a weapon for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession with intent to traffic in a motor vehicle with a significant amount of marijuana. At issue was whether or not the accused's s. 8, 9 and 10 Charter rights were infringed. HELD: All evidence obtained after the initial stop should be excluded pursuant to s24(2). The Court held that the Charter arguments refer only to a count in the indictment and that the police officer had every right to open the car door and speak to the passenger but did not have the authority to ask the accused if she wished to contact a lawyer. The Court found that the officer’s testimony that he was able to smell marijuana in the vehicle would in itself amount to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest. The evidence was excluded because it did not support reasonable and probable grounds."
4_1996canlii6648.txt,The applicant sought to have the law firm barred from acting for the plaintiff because a member of that firm had been active in representing the defendant prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change in government. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors. The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff. This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.  2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern. 4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme. It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists. Also such policies may well have changed since 1992.,"The applicant sought to have a solicitor barred from acting for the plaintiff by reason of a similar ruling involving a previous attempt to displace the applicant's present solicitors from certain litigation then existing following the 1982 change of solicitors. The solicitor had been active in representing the defendant Crown corporation during the years prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to therespondent in any event of the cause. Much was made by the applicant of the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigating of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. By reference to strategy counsel the applicant seems to suggest that the company has such litigation strategy and internal policies and procedures of confidential nature that could not be deduced from the pleadings and examinations for discovery by any competent lawyer. The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications, including this one, to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. The onus to establish the existence of confidential information justifying the requested order shifts to the party asserting the concern."
b_2008skpc104.txt,"The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act. There was a complaint to police concerning the accused. He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment. He smelled of alcohol. He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police. Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol. He was causing a disturbance to others. Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place. No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused. The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication. The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go. In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest.

A few minutes later, the complainant found something wrapped around his neck and he was choked until he passed out. When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him. She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back. The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat. Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door. Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay. When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked. She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. Appeal dismissed;  it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility. Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence. The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony.",The appellant appealed her conviction for robbery alleging error by the trial judge in his assessment of credibility.

The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation. The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation. The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions. The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court. The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants. The court dismissed the motion.",The plaintiffs brought a motion to consolidate their claim against the defendants with three other named actions. All four defendants were originally seeking consolidation of an action involving the same defendants and allegations regarding the improper negligent conduct of an investment advisor. The motion was dismissed with the exception that the matters be heard together (pursuant to Rule 37.02) because there was insufficient evidence to establish that the series of transactions were all part of the same transaction as contemplated by the Rule.

Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim. The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents.

The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga. The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands. The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages. In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act. HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1. As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents.","The petitioner manufactures log-home packages near Weyakwin, under the direction of Garry Varga, the sole director of the company. As a result of what the manufacture of these packages entails, both the company and Varga were convicted in Provincial Court of operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s.18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. In consequence, each was fined and ordered to pay a surcharge. The Attorney General applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for leave to appeal on the grounds the judge misconstrued the licensing provisions of the Act and hence misapplied them.

The convictions were set aside and the fines and surcharges were restored. 1)The circumstances in this case were such as to bring the case squarely within these provisions. The matter need not, and should not, have been taken up in the context of this case, at least not to the extent and to the effect the judge thought appropriate. 2)There is nothing in the case to suggest we might interfere with the decision of the trial judge, so they too must stand."
c_2013skca113.txt,"HELD: The applicant’s first two grounds of appeal related to the evidence of the respondents’ and police. The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that questions of evidence were of sufficient importance to grant leave. The applicant’s third ground was that the Chambers judge failed to take into account the interests of the public, particularly, the need to deter the public and the need to remove profit from crime to compensate victims. The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground. The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account. The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days. The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal.","The Director of The Seizure of Criminal Property Act (the Act) seeks leave to appeal a Queen's Bench Chambers decision which denied his application for the forfeiture of vehicle registered to the respondent Cheryl Brinkman. The Director's application was brought pursuant to s. of the Act on the ground that the vehicle had been used in criminal activity. HELD: Application dismissed. With respect to issues (a) and (b), the Court was not persuaded that, in the context of this case, questions of evidence are of sufficient importance to engage the Court. The Court conducted a relatively thorough review of the case law in the course of establishing the framework governing his decision-making. The Chambers judge did not consider matters relating to the deterrence of crime."
5_1999canlii12498.txt,The applicant sustained a lower back injury in an automobile accident in February 1995 which resolved within ten days to two weeks. In June 1995 he began to experience pain in his back which slowly worsened until he was hospitalized in October 1995. He was diagnosed with a large central and right sided disc herniation. SGI denied his claim for income replacement benefits as a non-earner under s.117(1) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. In issue was whether the accident caused the disc herniation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The plaintiff had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities. Two family physicians supported his contention but the medical director of rehabilitation services for SGI and the orthopaedic surgeon who treated the applicant were both of the opinion the herniation was not caused by the accident.,"The applicant, aged 34, sustained injury to his lower back in an automobile accident. The back injury resolved within 10 days to 2 weeks. He applied for income replacement benefits contending the accident did not cause the disc herniation. He appealed to the respondent, Saskatchewan Government Insurance, denying his claim for benefits. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The applicant had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities. The onus is on the applicant to establish his claim to the benefits on the basis of two family physicians. Dr. Dindo was his family physician prior to the accident and he was not diagnosed as suffering from a herniated disc or from any injury or dysfunction of the discs. He was generally in good health and had no evidence of any back problems. A review of all of the evidence showed that for a period of time after the disc hersiation, the non-earner was unable to hold the employment he could have held at the time of the accident, and would be entitled to an income replacement benefit if the hernaiation was caused by the accident."
d_2017skpc77.txt,"HELD: The accused was not guilty of either charge. Although the accused was lawfully stopped, the roadside demand was valid and the accused declined to exercise his right to counsel on two occasions following his arrest, the observation period at the detachment was not conducted properly. The officer was sometimes focused on other things. As the observation period comprised part and parcel of a breath test, the breathalyzer test was not properly administered and the Crown could not rely on the accuracy of the readings.","HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2, over.08. The Crown cannot rely on the presumption of accuracy in s. 258(1)(c) of the Criminal Code. The evidence does not support a finding of guilt on count #1. The observation period at the detachment was conducted properly. The police officer never saw the accused put anything in his mouth; he never heard the accused burp or belch; and he was in close proximity to the accused. Both samples were 100 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, and the breathalyzer instrument did not detect any mouth alcohol. The accused indicated that he understood his right to counsel but that he did not wish to call lawyer."
b_1997canlii11437.txt,"A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis. She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her. The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics. 2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part. The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted. The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage. ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4: The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes.","After the birth of their only child, the plaintiff, was admitted to the Victoria Union Hospital on an emergency basis as a result of profuse vaginal bleeding. The defendant performed the caesarian section, but also had to perform a hysterectomy. The plaintiff's allegations of negligence on the part of the defendant were that the likely cause of the ongoing or recurring bleeding was the retained products of conception which the defendant failed to remove from her uterus by a dilation and curettage procedure (D & C). HELD: The plaintiff was proven on a balance of probabilities that the defendant did not perform the D & C, aprocedure which would have remedied the hemorrhage which in turn would have obviated the necessity of performing the hysticomy. 1)There was no evidence to suggest that the operating room nurses' notes were a fabrication of something that did not happen. The medical evidence established that the medical records established a prima facie proof of the facts stated therein in Ares v. Venner. 2)It was the position of the plaintiff that the continuation or recurrence of the bleeding after September 29, 1992 was caused by the failure of the physician to properly remove the vaginal bleeding from the uterus. The Court referred to the surgical procedure as the 'd & C.' 3)The surgical procedure was not the only procedure performed to remediate the bleeding. It was also not the first procedure which was to be performed on a pregnant woman. The surgical procedures were only performed when the bleeding had recurred. 4)The Court was of the view that there was a general consensus among the medical experts that normally a doctor faced with a postpartum hemorrhage problem would, given that the most common cause thereof is retained product of conception, proceed to perform C. 5)Had the respondent wanted to challenge the accuracy of the nurses' reports, he should have called in the anaesthetist and other qualified obstetricians and gynaecologists to assist him. However, the Court was unable to do so because the surgical staff were not available for cross-examination."
d_2002skpc138.txt,"The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. He should not drink and drive.","The accused, a 28 year member of the RCMP, failed to comply with a demand made to him by a Peace Officer to provide then or a soon thereafter as is practicable such samples of his breath as in the opinion of a qualified technician are necessary to enable a proper analysis to be made in order to determine the concentration of alcohol in his blood contrary to s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1) On the evidence before the Court, it was not concluded that the accused's respiratory problems made it impossible for him to provide a sample. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not blowing properly into the mouthpiece. 2) The accused did provide an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about 1 hour before he was charged with refusal. It was only when he was asked to blow his mouthpiece each time that these supposed anxiety attacks caused him difficulty in blowing. 3) The police did not communicate the contents of the message on the answering machine to the accused thus not allowing him to consider a longer waiting period than the 10 minutes he did allow."
b_1996canlii6726.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production. If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys. A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing. The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act. The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times. On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a). 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value. It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do. If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent. There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan. The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.","FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from certain oil production properties, those proceeds now being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preservingand detaining all future proceeds from those properties. HELD: 1)A mandatory injunction can only be granted where the plaintiff shows a very strong probability upon the facts that grave damage will accrue to him in the future. This test goes much further than the 'prima facie', or strong prima facie, case that must be proven in a negative injunction application. 2)The applicants failed to meet the first and second tests of the test. The Court held that the applicants would suffer irreparable harm if the order sought was not granted because the fruits of any successful litigation will be no longer available at the time the litigation comes to an end and they suggest the liened lands will not have enough value in them to satisfy judgment. 3)The Court did not suggest that the plaintiff lose his lien security as a consequence of this confusion. If the plaintiffs' application was similar to that of all the other applicants it would be considerably greater inconvenience to the respondents than would be the inconvenience to them should it not be granted. 4)The application for a declaration as to entitlement to builders' liens on the properties owned by the various defendants and in default of payment of their appropriate costs was granted."
7_2016skpc104.txt,"Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08 The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)). As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house. The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD. He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired. He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him. He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples. The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal. The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face. The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.","The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol (under s. 253(1)(a) and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08) and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in the circumstances. HELD: 1) The accused's evidence was not credible as it tended to show that his consumption of alcohol was not yet in his blood stream when he was stopped by the officer but was at the time his breath tests were taken at the detachment. 2) The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was impaired. It was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused's alcohol consumption this evening and early morning (where he said he wanted to avoid seizure of his truck on his driveway but was concerned about losing his licence and having his vehicle seized); that his belief that he would be 'home free' if he reached his driveway was a mistake of law because what accept was this officer's power to stop the accused under s. 209.1 of that Act taken together with the Court's interpretation of the extension of that power from public road to private road in Anderson[1] was a reasonable excuse for not stopping for police officer. The Court rejected the evidence of Cobbledick and accepted its evidence of another expert who was qualified as an expert. 3) There is no doubt the accused attempted to get away from the police officer when he turned on his emergency lights, because he was afraid of the legal consequences that could befall him at that point. The accused was drinking alcohol steadily over the hours before he drove and this factor, taken into account the time since this day and the date of his breath samples taken, effected his recollection of what he had to drink that day and what he drank that evening and night. He denied that he was impaired when seen driving and said he was trying to make it back to his driveway as he believed this would legally protect him from having his truck seized. 4) The only witness was the alcohol expert. Her opinions were based on the drinking history of the officer and the BAC readings contained on the Certificate of Analysis.  5) While the accused denied being impaired, he admitted that he had had three ounces of vodka unabsorbed in his stomach at 2:40 a.m. He said he listened to two or three songs then decided to go for spin. He then put the cup into the console of his vehicle and listened to music while he waited for the officer to"
2_2011nssc500.txt,"The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction. After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation. Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.","The accused is charged with two counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 5(2) of the Code for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused stashed the drugs in a rock wall after the transaction and did so minutes before his arrest. His possession is constructive, done knowingly by him for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The Crown cannot demonstrate constructive possession of the baggy in the wall in the minute following the transaction with Mr. Burke. HELD: The accused is found guilty on both counts. 1) This is not a public hidy hole but one chosen so it could not easily be seen one foot off the ground pushed into the rock wall just inside the corner of the building. Discrepancies in his notes and earlier testimony about the lighting in the transaction location were not found. The evidence respecting the cutting substances in the plastic baggy was not consistent with street level drug trafficking practices and the encounters between the buyer and the accused were consistent with these drug traffickers practices. 2) The Court accepted the evidence of Constable Marriott who was qualified as an expert to provide expert evidence with respect to jargon, use, availability, paraphernalia, distribution, packaging, sale, price and value of crack cocaine, as well as methods of avoiding police detection and stashing of drugs. His evidence concerning what he observed at the transaction was consistent with that of other drug traffickers. 3) The evidence concerning the gesturing to another place for the deal to take place is common practice to avoid detection."
5_2013skqb237.txt,"The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety. There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop. The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device. The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer. At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood. A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings. A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them. The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused. The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook. The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one. The accused did not recall this waiver. The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty. The accused's readings were .11 and .04. The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results. HELD: The appeal was not successful. Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b). The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure. The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned. The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective. The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached. The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving a motor vehicle contrary to Criminal Code s.253(1)(a) and (2)having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s. 253(1(b) of the Criminal Code and (1) operating a vehicle while impaired by alcohol contrary to S.255(2)(a)). The Crown did not pursue the first count but did launch an appeal as to the second count. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There will be no costs. The trial judge addressed the factors and correctly applied the test. As there was no error, the trial judge committed no error in finding and finding a breach of s.10(b).  1)The trial judge reviewed the various indications and found that the accused was not provided an opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. 2)When the computer search was negative, the matter was abandoned. The officer displayed indifference and indifference to the accused's request for a sample of his breath.  3)The waiver did not remedy the deficiency for the accused, who did not fully comprehend the situation. This rendered any wavier ineffective."
9_2009skqb313.txt,"The appellant appeals a demolition order pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act issued against his property. Issues on appeal was whether the board erred by considering material which had not been before city council, whether the board committed a jurisdictional error by failing to disclose evidence to the appellant prior to considering the appeal, and whether the board was biased against the appellant. HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order. The applicant is granted a 6 month period to remedy the problems identified. 1) The board complied with the directions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure had been made to the appellant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. The board has ensured that the appellant knew the case he had to meet. No error of law has been committed. 2) The appellant had all the information considered by the board disclosed to him. 3) There is no evidence of bias. Oppositely, the evidence supports the board's conclusion that the situation in the building constituted a nuisance related to the activities around the building, including the safety of the residents and surrounding neighbours. There is no evidence of bias against the appellant personally.","The registered owner of the property appealed a demolition order made by the City of Prince Albert (the 'City') with certain conditions. Although the demolition order was dated November 18, 2004, legal proceedings had extended the life of the building at that time. The building inspector at the time of the order advised the respondent that he should apply to the court for an adjournment to allow the appellant to remedy the underlying problems. The respondent sought leave from the Court of Queen's Bench to bring forth his written proposal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The appeal must be dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. 2) The Board has complied with the direction of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure has been made to the applicant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. In this way, the board has ensured that the plaintiff knew the case he had to meet. No error of law has been committed.  3) There is no merit to the contention that the board lacked jurisdiction to decide on the disclosure of the police files. It would be incumbent on the applicant to pursue other avenues including application to the Court for subpoena or other Order directing production of documents."
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","The Director applied under the Seizure of Criminal Property Act for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 of property to the Crown in Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from the William Ross Butler in 2008. Since the plaintiff filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act. HELD: 1) The Director's application was granted subject to the expiration of the limitation period. 2) The legislation is civil not criminal in nature and it is an in rem remedy. 3) There is no retroactivity problem. The evidence on when the Director 'became satisfied' the seized property constituted proceeds of unlawful activity is found in the Affidavit of Tammy Pryznyk. 4) The Court accepts the Director as an expert qualified to express an opinion in the area of controlled drugs and substances (the CDSA) two years after the date of its discovery.

He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The father of one child applied to reduce his child support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under an order of Archambault J. dated March 6, 1996. He was ordered to pay $600 per month as support for the child. The mother's application was adjourned sine die with direction to return the matter to court once the grievance filed by the father concerning his termination from Ipsco was determined by an arbitrator. HELD: 1) On all of the evidence it is the father's choice to work a minimum amount each year and, if he should return to school, it will be his choice to severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. The difficulty in the matter is determining whether or not the father has been successful on this motion. 2) The father is underemployed. His decision to work minimum amounts each year (i.e. to only work three months of the year) is not a reasonable decision when he has a continuing obligation to provide support for his child, Stephanie. It is very likely that Mr. Pilat's financial position has not changed as result of the order for child support. 3) The mother has grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in this proceeding. The court will grant costs as against the father for the additional legal expenses associated with having to submit motions to the Court in order to force the father to disclose financial information."

At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This was an appeal from an order of Barclay J. which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the labour Relations Board, and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board.

In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial. The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify.

The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction.

Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment. There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.","The applicant sought an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that the judge and other provincial court judge could not hear the trial of the accused in Queen v.

The husband had declared personal bankruptcy since the date of the original orders obtained under the Matrimonial Property Act and Divorce Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to pay maintenance was reduced to $1 per month and the arrears accruing after the date of his assignment into bankruptcy were cancelled.  2)The wife's counsel requested that the court value and divide all of the matrimonial property equally notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because she might pursue a constructive trust claim for her 1/2 share as against the husband's trustee. 3)The court valued all of the matrimonial property and determined that 56% of this value should be paid to the wife, and only 44% to the husband, given amounts he had spent since the separation.  4)The court left unresolved the issue of which matrimonial assets might be exempt under the Bankruptcy Act and therefore available to the wife.","Division of matrimonial property. Husband did not pursue livestock operation on the farm for a number of reasons. One of them was the fact that he required surgery on his back making it impossible for him to physically do the work.

HELD: 1)The respondent was asked in accordance with my prior judgment to complete the division of property. 2)The petitioner paid $2,300 by way of maintenance out of the proceeds of certain barley he sold privately. The respondent claimed this was in violation of his original order prohibiting the sale of any assets without consent of the other party or the Court. 3)Division based on asset values at this stage problematical. The petitioner required income to live on and the barley fell into that category.

HELD: The conditional provision was removed as time spent on electronic monitoring and post sentence efforts were considered. A conditional sentence was not available in the circumstances. The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions. The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public.

The sentencing judge noted the respondent's alcohol problem, his three and one-half year of sobriety and that the respondent did so well on probation he was released early at his own request in December 1999. She also considered a positive pre-sentence report and the fact the respondent spent time on remand. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conditional sentence imposed. 1)When one reviews the record it is easy to understand the position taken by the Crown which is for a penitentiary sentence. 2)The community disposition was likely to be more effective than the one imposed for the offences of theft when the Crown has finished monitoring the record. A sentence of three to four years for all the offences is considered when all the circumstances presented by the Court of Appeal are considered. A community disposition is the most effective way to deal with the gravity of the offences. 3)The respondent is 38 years old with 49 prior convictions.

SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The defendant sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 requiring the plaintiffs to post security for its costs in this action on the grounds that Wind Power Inc. was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan and Dove Industries was a corporation which wasincorporated specifically for a wind power demonstration project which did not have the funds to proceed as planned and had little assets in Saskatchewan. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There were appropriate circumstances in Thole v. McKenna (1988), 48 C.P.C. 150 (Ont. S.C.) for the Court to direct security for costs at this stage. 2)The plaintiff had not brought the application at an earlier stage of the proceedings as it wished to provide an opportunity at the pre-trial conference stage for the matter to be resolved. 3)The fact that it was not made until now would have left the plaintiffs with the distinct possibility that, ultimately, the court was not going to be asked by SaskPower to have them furnish security. 4)There are appropriate circumstances, per Grotsky J., to deny the defendant an order that the plaintiffs Post Security for Costs at This Stage of the Action.

c_1998canlii12344.txt,"At issue was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly having regard for s303(1) of the Rural Municipality Act and how and when notice was given. The company posted the notice of appeal by registered mail the day before the expiration of the 20 day appeal period. The notice arrived at the post office on a Friday, the day after the period expired and was picked up by the administrator the following Monday. The Appeals Committee refused to direct the board of revision to hear the appeal on the basis the company failed to give notice within the period prescribed by s303(1) and concluded that the board did not have the power to extend the time. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The board of revision was directed to hear and determine the assessment appeal. 1)The Committee did not err in deciding the prescribed time period for an appeal could not be extended.  2)The less formal expression 'to give notice to' as used in the Act is a less exacting term than 'to serve notice upon'. Wascana Energy exercised its right of appeal properly, or at least effectively, requiring the board of revision to entertain the appeal.","The question in this case was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly, or effectively, having regard for the governing provisions of the statute and the fact of how and when notice of appeal was given. HELD: The appeal from the decision of the Committee was allowed with costs as usual and there was an order directing the board to hear and determine the company's appeal. 1)The phrase'may give notice in writing' must be taken by implication to allow for notice to be given by means of registered mail. 2)This is a comparatively narrow context, concerned as it is with the meaning of the word give in virtual isolation, removed from the purpose of the subsection and the objectives of its terms. One might reasonably interpret the statutory terms governing the exercise of the right to appeal as calling for no more, necessarily, than the posting of the requisite notice by registered mail before the expiration of the statutory appeal period. In other words, some steps in exercising the right had been taken prior to that date, including the mailing of the notice to the administrator. 3)Nothing turned on the fact the notice did not arrive a day or two earlier, for the administrator and board were still able to act upon it in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. 4)The word give is not an importation of the necessity of receipt. This would add a desirable measure of bureaucratic certainty to the appeal process. It could then be acted upon only if received before the 20 day period expires, not otherwise, not even if received in sufficient time to enable the Board to hear the appeal. Nor did any other form of prejudice arise."

In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible.

He moved for a stay of proceedings on the grounds that the Crown had failed to provide adequate disclosure. In response, the Crown filed an affidavit to show that disclosure had been made. The respondent then applied to the Court of Appeal for an order of prohibition. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The appeal must be allowed. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court, whether composed of a judge and jury or a jury alone, does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment of Matheson J. in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. In that case, a Crown witness inadvertently disclosed that the accused had a criminal record by stating that he had served notice to seek a greater penalty by reason of prior conviction.

In the year 2005-2006 the parties did not contemplate payment of bonus because the cows had been more carefully bread and calving was expected to occur and did occur in the more mild temperatures of April and May.

The parties conducted their business together according to the terms of the 2004 agreement with the exception that the cost of labour was raised to sixty cents per day. Another sixty calves were delivered to the plaintiffs' pastures in the spring and early summer. Benson testified that the reason the amount was left blank in the contract was because neither of them were sure what it should be. He testified that he had heard some people were charging seventy dollars per calf but he never received a bill from them. He said he never sent a bill because he didn't know what to charge.

The plaintiff alleges that the road condition was icy on the exit ramp leading up to the Buckwold Bridge and the city had not taken steps to address the icy road surfaces. To refuse the application would result in the requirement for a second litigation process to be commenced, that being by the defendants against the proposed third party claiming contributory negligence. The city opposed the application and argued that s. 308 of the Cities Act may be an absolute defence. HELD: The application was granted. 1) It is not proper to assess evidence or go into possible defences.  2) The application is purely one of procedure and no substantive rights between the parties can be determined on it. There is no prima facie claim for damages caused by the defendant's truck leaving the road in one proceeding. 3) The applicant has not raised any causal connection between the cause of action pled in the first proceeding nor has there been any prejudice to the plaintiff in the second proceeding.

6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act, RSS 1978, L-16 [LCRA] in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. The main issue relates to how the proceeds of sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against a mortgage balance when there are both purchase money and non-purchase money balances. The issue in Andrew (CA) is whether or not the trial judge considered Hrynewich Holdings in its entirety. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1) The appeal is allowed with respect to the amount of the deficiency judgment. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. However, these proceeds were not sufficient to satisfy the loan. The respondent then sought an order entitling it to the deficiency.  2) There are two issues to determine: a) how should the sale be applied to the mortgage balance, and b) what is the proper amount of deficiency judgment? The appeal will deal with each issue in turn. A) the appeal will be allowed on the basis of the sale proceeds of $345,000 (the proceeds from the judicial sale must be distributed pro rata between the purchase and nonpurchase funds). The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of the LCRA. An application of these principles to this appeal leads to the following calculation: 1) the portion of the loan attributable to the purchase of the land was 64.03% (64.03 % of the total loan) and $87,711 (19.03%) were applied against the purchase money portion; 2) the respondent accords with the policy behind the legislation as set out in this judgment;  3) the order below should be varied to entitle the respondent to take out deficiency judgment against the appellants (the balance owing of $536,186.72) against the respondent; 4) the amount owed to the appellant pursuant to s. 25 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act should be $162,675.99 and 5) the reasons in hand should guide the disposition of the appeal.

She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties. Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home. HELD: 1)Relocation was neither foreseen nor reasonably contemplated by the judge making the original order. The threshold criteria was thus satisfied. 2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence. The child had a close relationship with both parents. The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed. 3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied. If the mother proceeded with her move a revision of the access provision would be appropriate. 4)The child's best interest is the proper test to be applied (Cote) having regard to the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon. 5)The applicant became aware in early June of the mother's intention to move to British Columbia and did not object. The timing of the application, a few weeks prior to the proposed move, raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application.  6)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The respondent applied to vary the terms of the consent judgment such that the applicant would have sole custody of their daughter and the alternative was that the respondent sought an order preventing the respondent from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The parties separated in October 1994 and the daughter had been in the respondent's care since that time. The mother had been a stay-at-home mom and raised the daughter with the respondent. She had indicated in her notice of motion that she intended to move to Kelowna to enroll the child in a Christian private school and had discussed the possibility of the applicant selling the furniture and allowing her to move back into the home she had always lived in. HELD: 1)The child had a close relationship with both parents and there was nothing to suggest relocation was either foreseen or would have beenreasonably contemplated by the judge who made the initial order. 2)The threshold criteria was satisfied. The court was not able to assess the effect of a disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community. 3)The Court was therefore required to embark on a fresh inquiry. The question was whether the inquiry, in the circumstances of this case, could be conducted on the basis of the affidavit evidence before the Court.  4)While there is no legal presumption in favour of the custodial parent, her views are entitled to great respect and there has been an existing custody arrangement for almost three years. The applicant concedes the respondent is a good mother and there is nothing which puts into dispute the close relationship that exists between the mother and her. However, there is still a reasonable prospect that she will be able to return to Regina to re-open the matrimonial home. 5)The court was unable, in this instance, to assess whether there was a disruption to the existing access arrangements and the relationship between the parties. As a result the trial of an issue will be required."

There were 40 questions in total. The Court was asked to relate the questions to 19 factual summaries presented by the Board concerning cases before it. The Court was required to decide whether the questions were the proper subject matter of a stated case. Dismissing the stated case application, that the questions submitted are hypothetical and speculative. They are therefore inappropriate questions for a stated case, which requires that questions must be responsive to the facts and must not be speculative.",The application for the stated case was dismissed without costs. The court declined to answer the questions submitted by the respondent as to the correctness of provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act.
8_2001nssc179.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","The plaintiff/defendant sought reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses it incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it claimed were required because of the failure of Roper Ltd. to perform the contract. The defendant counterclaimed for damages arising out of losses it suffered as a result of the contract's unjustified termination and as extras for services it had never been paid for. The contractual obligation to'maintain the banks' was to be construed by the wording in the contract, and any variation in wording between the previous invitation for tenders and the 1985 invitation for tender was inconsequential. The plaintiff was required to maintain and service the banks and in order to have equipment on site it was necessary to remove snow from the areas in which coal was being loaded and to reduce the build up of methane gas and the risk of fire within the banks. The equipment supplied by the defendant was not the same type and model as it listed in the response to the tender, and no objection appeared to have been taken with the equipment delivered to the site. Operational, Payment and Performance Issues: 1) The nature of the work involved banks, ditches, and roadways. 2) Banks were to be serviced by railcars or truck on a five-day week on an 'as required' basis until July 24, 1985. 3) Lifting and Bending involved using railcars to move coal from the wash plant to the lift plant. During this period the coal would be piled in banks at various stages of the VJCPP. Railcars or trucks were used to load the coal. 4) The lifting and lifting of coal used railcars and truck trailers. 5) The equipment was used to lift coal from various stock piles on either railcar or truck for shipment to the customer. 6) The amount of money owed by the plaintiff was $22.00 per hour for standby time and equipment rental rates based on the general conditions and specifications set out in the tender. 7) Maintenance of the banks (banking, blending and lifting) was not to be concerned as nothing herein turned on the delay in progress in the work nor in respect to the type of equipment brought on site.  8) The provision in the purchase order incorporating the terms and conditions contained in the specifications was not being used for reasons other than the breakdown of the equipment itself.  9) The purchase order did not refer to the amount of coal that had been received at the time of the tender but rather to the number of railcars loaded at the lift"
8_2010nssc219.txt,"The parties' hostility prevented them from reaching an agreement on interim parenting arrangements for their two-and-a-half-year-old child. There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months). The mother had nothing positive to say about him. They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child. He agreed to abstain from drugs around the child and for 12 hours before access. The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country. Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access. The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.",The mother sought to have the father's access supervised. The father had not had contact with the child since January 2010 and was concerned that he would be able to obtain an Egyptian passport for his daughter. The mother also alleged that the father had threatened her with removal and that she should seek help from Veith House to obtain a passport for her daughter. Father did not admit to threats to harm the child nor about his placing her in situations where there were peanuts present. The evidence did not support this allegation on the necessary balance of probabilities. HELD: 1)Joint custody does not necessarily mean joint custody is inappropriate. Both parties during the most recent incident had an opportunity to prevent escalation. The Father could have taken the jacket and left without getting into a tug-of-war over the jacket. The only evidence that the Father was from another country and still had family living in Egypt and Kuwait would not suggest a realistic likelihood of his doing so. 2)The father was to attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he will be informed about child development and understand how to appropriately parent the child.  3)The mother was to have regular access for two hours each weekday for one evening visit and two hours for one afternoon visit. Interim access was to be provided for two weeks at a time. 4)The Father was not to be under the influence of marijuana 12 hours before and while he had the child in his care.
e_1999canlii1479.txt,"The respondent was recruited by the respondents. Her job was to start quality assurance practice. She accepted an offer of employment, giving up her own company to do so. After 15 months she was dismissed. The trial judge in her action for wrongful dismissal and negligent misrepresentation did not find any negligent misrepresentation but awarded damages equivalent to five months notice for wrongful dismissal. The appellant appealed the dismissal of her claim for negligent misrepresentation and the notice period for her wrongful dismissal. The respondent cross-appealed the damage award, claiming the trial judge failed to take into account the appellant's failure to mitigate. Appeal and cross-appeal, that the evidence supports the trial judge's findings, and he did not make any errors in law.","The appellant sought damages for wrongful dismissal and negligent misrepresentation. She was awarded 24 months salary in lieu of notice and $15,000 in aggravated damages for mental distress. The respondent cross-appealed, claiming the five-month notice period should be reduced due to the appellant's failure to mitigate her loss. The trial judge upheld the action against the appellant on the basis that the misrepresentation was not 'negligent' and the term in the contract providing for dismissal on notice was an effective disclaimer precluding any separate action in tort. The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge failed to specifically address the arguments that the applicant should have been told that the project was a one-year trial period only and that if she did not fit into the corporate culture within that time, she would be dismissed without cause on one month's notice. In his decision, he also held that the employer, having extended the applicant's contract for 3 months beyond the 1 year period, waived its right to terminate the contract on 1 month's Notice as provided in clause 13. This finding is not on appeal."
