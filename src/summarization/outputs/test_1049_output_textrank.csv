1,"The Municipality will provide support to Catherine's parents for Catherine's child once the child is born."" In dismissing the application for an order in the nature of certiorari, Mr. Justice Rogers found that the appellant was supported by her parents and that she did not qualify under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 (M.S.A. Policy 1.2.5) of the City providing for assistance to the single head of family.","This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother.
The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance.
The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child.
Allowing the appeal,
that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act.
Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible.
It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children.
In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born.
The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands."
2,"The argument presented by counsel for the I.D.A., in opposition to the application for an interim injunction is that the penalty hearing is not new hearing of the disciplinary panel but simply reconvening of the proceeding and that, therefore, the decision of the Appeal Division, in setting aside the interim injunction granted by Nathanson, J., that it is premature to interfere with the affairs of domestic tribunal is still applicable at this time.","This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct.
The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel.
The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances.
In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend.
The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission.
The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard.
Dismissing the application for an interim injunction,
that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet."

The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking.
The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project.
When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers.
At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction.
The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction.
Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors.
The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'.
One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction.
On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters.
With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee.
Dismissing the action,
that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable.
Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it.
Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it.
The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project.
At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project; 
(2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;
 and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings.
The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members.
The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien."
7,"He concluded: ""In my opinion, however, the rule in question does not limit the inherent power of judge presiding at trial of civil proceeding to give such directions, including the exclusion of parties during the hearing of any testimony of another witness, as the judge considers necessary for the orderly conduct of the proceeding and for reaching just conclusion."" Chief Justice Cowan was there dealing with case where the parties intended to be excluded were seven infant plaintiffs.","The defendants applied to exclude the plaintiff grandchildren of the deceased from their respective discovery examinations in connection with an action under the Fatal Injuries Act.
Dismissing the application,
that there was insufficient evidence to indicate there would be a violation of an essential of justice if the parties were excluded from hearing each other's testimony.
The only evidence before the court was that the lines of questioning of each grandchild would be identical.
This was insufficient to displace a party's inherent right to attend his co-party's discovery."
8,"Thus, the principles enunciated in Pelech are not entirely applicable to the case at Bar. However, am of the view that, where parties have negotiated final separation agreement incorporating not only maintenance provisions but also property distribution, and the terms of that agreement are reflected in subsequent court order, only radical change in the circumstances of the payor, not within the specific contemplation of the parties, would allow for review of that court order dealing with on‑going maintenance.","This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards.
The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children.
Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home.
The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties.
The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal.
The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final.
Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order,
that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected.
There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision.
The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases.
To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties.
Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period.
The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period.
Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision."

In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial.
The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify.
Due to the delay in obtaining authority to serve an out of town subpoena in New Brunswick, the Crown was unable to serve the victim until three days before trial.
The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend.
An adjournment was granted.
The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction.
Dismissing the application.
It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code.
Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law.
Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion.
If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ.
In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment.
There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown."

The Court of Appeal had ordered the Crown to produce an itemized inventory of the information in its possession to enable the Queen's Bench to review the information the Crown should disclose to the defence.
This fiat concerned several documents.
The Crown had already disclosed the contents of each of these documents and the only matter remaining in issue was the name of the lawyer who released the information.
This arose as a result of the action of a Regina lawyer who had improperly revealed information from two of his divorce clients with respect to the charges against LaPorte et al.

Prior to being sentenced, he spent 13 days on remand and 2 months under house arrest under s.7.1 of the Young Offenders Act.
The Crown appealed the sentence.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
1)The accused was 15 years of age and had no record.
He assisted the police once apprehended.
2)Although another young offender involved in these offences had received a sentence of 9 months open custody, uniformity of sentence was not a factor to be given great weight in comparing dispositions of young offenders.

16,"The Crown appealed on the ground the two terms of closed custody, having been ordered to be served concurrently with the earlier term, did not constitute a fit sentence having regard for the seriousness of the offenses, the requirements of deterrence, and the need to uphold public confidence in the administration of justice.","A young offender was sentenced to 1 year closed custody on each of 2 armed robberies, the sentences to be consecutive to each other, but both being concurrent to the remainder of a sentence of 2 years closed custody which was already being served with respect to previous unrelated convictions when the accused escaped and committed the robberies.
18 months of the previous sentence remained to be served with the result that the total time in custody would only be increased by 6 months as a result of the 2 robbery convictions.
The Crown appealed.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
The sentence neither reflected the seriousness of the offences nor provided adequate deterrence.

The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee.
To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan.
Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier.
When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances.
She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security.
HELD: Application dismissed.
1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act.
2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy.
The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused.
3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan.
4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer.
In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan.
There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension."
18,Presumably the picketing prohibition term of the accused's release from custody was considered necessary by the justice who made the order to address the issue of the substantial likelihood that the accused would commit criminal offence if he were not prohibited from picketing prior to his trial.,"FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel.
The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place.
He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial.
He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully.
HELD: Application dismissed.
Amendment refused.
If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges.
The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing."
19,"He admits that over all the agreement is more favourable to the employee than the minimum standards set out in the Act. He further admits that the agreement's provisions governing pay for holidays are more favourable than the comparable provisions in the Act. have no difficulty therefore in concluding that in the circumstances of this case the provisions of the agreement are more favourable to Morgan than the terms of the Act. That being the case, in light of the Caxton, supra, decision, the provisions of the agreement should govern, and not those of the Act.

Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question.
Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act."
20,"While Dr. Elliott considered that her present level of disability was ""in part"" the result of the accident of February 8, 1988, he was unable to quantify that part. conclude therefor that the whiplash injury was of mild to moderate nature and that it was to large extent cleared up within three months with some continuing discomfort for perhaps another year after which its impact upon this often injured person was not significant and should not be considered in assessing damages arising from the February 8, 1988 accident.","The Plaintiff, aged 72 years, claimed ongoing damages resulting from a whiplash injury suffered in a motor vehicle accident 5 years earlier.

Mr. Latimer has argued that the plaintiff's failure to obtain default judgment in compliance with Civil Procedure Rule 12.03, was to use the language of some of the cases, breach of procedural requirement which goes to the root of our conceptions of the proper procedure in litigation, thereby entitling his client to have the default judgment set aside as of right ex debito justitiae without terms imposed by the court.","The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued.
Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs.
The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence.
Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff,
that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant.
Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse."
23,"Firstly, the notes produced from SGI of conversations with Ms. Mak, solicitor in Judge Lavoie's office, indicate that the Lavoie firm was continuing to represent the plaintiff some six months after the initial consultation, and were preparing to file statement of claim. The applicants' decision to destroy their office files is understandable, but do see merit in Mr. Turple's argument that the decision did not recognize the contingent element involved in the situation of an infant plaintiff.","FIAT The Defendants were consulted by the Plaintiff and her mother 11 years earlier with respect to commencing an action for personal injuries arising out of a motor vehicle accident.
The Plaintiff was only 12 at the time.

No. IN THE NOVA SCOTIA COURT OF APPEAL BETWEEN: HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN, and EDWIN LEO SAVOURY, RESPONDENT NOTICE OF APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL (SENTENCE) 1.","The respondent pled guilty in provincial court to a charge of break, enter and theft for breaking into his neighbour's house and removing lingerie from a chest of drawers in the master bedroom..
He was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,500 or 50 days in default, plus a victim fine surcharge of $250 and three years probation.
The terms of the probation order included a direction that the respondent pay restitution to the victims in the amount of $300, that he not have contact with the victims and that he continue treatment with his psychiatrist.
The Crown appealed the sentence, alleging that it inadequately reflected the element of deterrence.
Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge considered the correct principles of sentencing .
This was a unique case where it was apparent that the respondent did not commit the offence for the usual reasons and that he required psychiatric treatment."
25,"The script and logger reel having long been destroyed and it is impossible to recreate exactly what was aired by the defendant station on the morning of April 4th, but the evidence was that 12 year old girl had been sexually assaulted by two juvenile boys between the Roller Rink and Carpet World, "". When the newscast came on the air in the early morning of April 4th, it made Ludwig Deli very angry and upset and he got carried away; Ina Deli became distraught, they immediately misinterpreted the sexual assault as having occurred at the Roller Rink whereas that was not said at any time.","A radio station reported that a 12 year old girl was dragged and sexually assaulted behind a roller rink or between the rink and a store.
The owner of the rink claimed financial compensation for a subsequent decline in his business which he alleged was a direct result of the broadcast.
The script and reel had been destroyed and it was impossible to recreate exactly what was aired.
HELD: The action was dismissed with costs.
1)Nothing that the defendant published was false, malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse.
2)The station followed the CRTC Regulations and was exonerated entirely by its controlling body.
The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source.
3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation.
The business was on a down side at the time.
The assault occurring where it did was not the fault of either party.
If it had a bearing on the immediate attendance figure it was minimal and the plaintiff did no promotion whatsoever to increase attendance."
26,"The applicant seeks interim support based on some maintenance guidelines suggested by the Government which when the petitioner's and the applicant's current income is taken into account indicates that the respondent should pay the applicant around $2,400.00 per month.","FIAT. The parties were divorced in 1995 and all issues including spousal maintenance were left in abeyance.
The petitioner had agreed to pay $3,000 per month which included child support but the support was reduced to $1,000 and was irregular and late.
The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment.
The petitioner's income exceeded $80,000 annually but he had been suspended with pay and the status of his employment was uncertain.
HELD: 1)It was premature to fix the amount of spousal maintenance as asked for by the applicant.
There were too many unknowns including the future of the petitioner's future job and income and how much the applicant would require should she go to university in the fall and what the children would do about future education.
2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the maintenance.
3)The petitioner was directed to pay $1,500 plus $200.00 per month until the shortfall was paid in full.
 4)The applicant was awarded costs of the application."
27,"Many persons testified as to the fitness of Tracy or Lorne to act as the custodial parent for Sophie. Assaults and Misconduct While the past physical abuse of Tracy by Lorne is not acceptable, it is only relevant in the instant case if it affects his ability to parent Sophie.","A decree nisi and an order granting custody to the mother was made in 1995.
Upon appeal the Court of Appeal directed a new trial.
Changes in circumstances included the fact that the child was developmentally delayed and required a special program.
A pediatrician testified that inconsistency in parenting approaches would further delay the child's development.
HELD: Custody was awarded to the father.
1)Each parent was a capable caregiver.
However, the father was available to provide full-time care due to an employment disability and exhibited a strong desire to do so.
The past physical abuse of his former spouse was not considered relevant as it did not affect his ability to parent the child.
2)The mother was to have weekly access on two non-consecutive days for eight hours and two hours on a third day.
The child was to sleep in the same bed every night."
28,"July 2, 1996 Clearly, the defendant, Kasper Gordon Bawolin (""Bawolin""), has been in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff, Viola Rose Siemens (""Siemens""), for her trust funds. Counsel for Siemens urges me to order Bawolin to pay forthwith, the solicitor/client costs to be taxed.","FIAT. The defendant had been held in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for her trust funds.
The issue here was responsibility for the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to compel production.
Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized.
An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention.
Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.
 1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared.
Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties.
2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics.
However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge.
It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs.
It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected."
29,"However, as I have indicated earlier, I believe that Mr. Hand is capable of managing some of his affairs and I am further of the view that at this stage in his life, the plans which he proposes are reasonable and I believe that some of the proceeds from the land sale should be placed directly into his control to pursue his financial commitments and his dreams, with the balance being placed in the hands of the Public Trustee as his property guardian to appropriately administer in his longer term best interests.","The applicant sought to be appointed as property guardian for his uncle pursuant to s19 of the Dependent Adults Act.
The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years.
The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs.
He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951.
Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew.
There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand.
The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property.
However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit.
His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest.
2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.
 3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand.
One half of the proceeds were to be provided directly to Hand to be dealt with as he chooses and the remaining half were to be administered by the Public Trustee in his longer term best interests according to the normal powers and procedures of that office."
30,"After indicating that he would think it appropriate to have kept the plaintiff in hospital for observation, he concludes by saying that ""these situations occur not uncommonly and it is left up to the treating physician as to how far one should go in managing these wounds."" In his subsequent letter, Exhibit 9, written two years later and responding to questions of plaintiff's counsel, Dr. Petrie expresses the opinion that the medical history take by Dr. Janes was inadequate.","The plaintiff's leg was impaled for 25 minutes on an iron fence which he had attempted to climb for.
He was treated at the emergency department of the Victoria General Hospital for an hour.
He did not inform the doctors as to the length of time he had been impaled.
Upon his release he was advised to watch for any infection.
He was not issued antibiotics.
The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg.
He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence.
Dismissing the action,
that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way.
While the defendants underestimated the nature and extent of the injury, they provided a recognized method of treatment based upon the knowledge they had.
The real fault lies with the plaintiff who failed to reveal fully what had happened to him."
31,"Where, however, the fresh evidence does not possess that decisive character which would allow an immediate disposition of the appeal but, nevertheless, has sufficient weight or probative force that if accepted by the trier of fact, when considered with the other evidence in the case, it might have altered the result at trial, the Court of Appeal should admit the proffered evidence and direct new trial where the evidence could be heard and the issues determined by the trier of fact."" [Emphasis added] The appellant says that due to her mental condition, specifically depression leading up to the granting of the uncontested divorce, she could not have produced the relevant evidence at trial, thus meeting the first requirement of the Palmer test.","The parties executed a separation agreement that resolved all matters corollary to their divorce and the Matrimonial Property Act.
The respondent husband proceeded with an uncontested divorce.
The appellant wife did not oppose the proceeding.
She subsequently appealed the corollary relief judgment on the grounds that the underlying separation agreement is unconscionable and unduly harsh.
She sought to introduce fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce.
Dismissing the appeal with costs,
that even with the new evidence, the appellant still failed to demonstrate an adequate excuse for not responding to the divorce proceeding.
There was no evidence that the appellant did not understand her legal entitlement at the time the agreements were signed, or that she did not appreciate that a divorce proceeding had been commenced."
32,"In the absence of contract, Hazmasters, the supplier of materials to All Ports, does not have cause of action against Rideau Construction, the general contractor.","After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, the plaintiff, a supplier of materials to the sub-contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub-contractor.
The Bond contained a provision limiting the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to any claimant not having a contract directly with the principal.
Dismissing the action with costs,
that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier.
With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work.
As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff.
Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond."
33,"33(1) of The Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, no certificate of title is to be granted and no transfer, mortgage, lease or other instrument executed by the respondent is to be effectual, except subject to the rights of the claimant. In about 1981 she learned the deceased had transferred his farm land to the applicant but did nothing then or later to enforce her Maintenance Order against the land.","The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.130 of the Land Titles Act and s.56 of the Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act for an order relieving the estate from payment of maintenance ordered in 1972.
The respondent objected to the application being brought on behalf of the estate as Olson was neither executrix nor a beneficiary under the Will.
The Will had not been admitted to probate.
The respondent had divorced testator in 1972 and was granted child support of $60 per month and monthly spousal support of $40.
The applicant who cohabited with the deceased since 1978 transferred her home to him in 1980 as joint tenants and he transferred his two and one-half quarter sections of farm land to the applicant.
The applicant suggested there was an agreement whereby the respondent lived rent free in the matrimonial home in lieu of support.
The respondent received welfare to support herself and the children and had had no funds to pursue enforcement of the unpaid support payments.
HELD: 1)The style of cause was amended to show Olson as applicant.
She was an interested party within the meaning of s.56 of the EMOA and entitled to bring the application on her own behalf.
The respondent was not misled and there was no prejudice.
2)The Land Titles Act was of no assistance to the applicant.
The application was to be determined upon s.56 of the EMOA and whether it would be grossly unfair and inequitable to refuse the application.
3)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge.
There was no evidence presented either of consideration being paid nor of what became of the income generated by the land prior to the deceased's death.
 4)A trial of an issue was ordered to determine what if any portion of the arrears should remain a charge upon the lands.
Some of the evidence conflicted.
Viva voce evidence should be heard."
34,The appellant seeks to have the respondent’s income increased by adding the value of unsold grain on hand and 100 percent of his capital cost allowance.,"The appellant sought to have the support payments ordered by the chambers judge increased on the basis the income of the respondent was incorrectly estimated and should have been increased by adding the value of unsold grain on hand and 100 percent of his capital cost allowance.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.
1)There was clearly no basis for adding the value of the grain on hand to the income of the respondent.
There was no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and the grain was to be viewed as part of his gross income in the year in which it was sold.
2)There was no reversible error by the chamber judge in accepting the respondent's agreement to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income.
What if any portion should be added must be based on the facts of each case."
35,Based on St. Pierre where the presumption of identity does not apply then the Crown may rely on the remaining evidence including the certificate of analysis to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was over .08 at the time of driving.,"The appellant was convicted of failing a breathalyzer test.
The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity.
He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence.
The appellant appealed.
Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial,
that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown."
36,"[11] If counsel require it, might add to or extend my reasons for my decision in this respect but trust the above comments will be sufficient to indicate the rationale for my [12] The matter of costs of this application will be reserved to the trial judge.","FIAT. At issue was what evidence of a prior action could be put before the jury.
The trial was imminent.
HELD: 1)The jury may be advised of the prior accident, its date, that proceedings were commenced in this Court and date of those proceedings and that the accident was ultimately settled and the action discontinued.
The terms of the settlement and the sum paid were not to be disclosed.
Beyond the issue of privilege which was a complete answer to the request, revisiting that action was a more critical problem.
The sum paid to settle the first action was not allocated to any head of damages so those issues would have to be transversed as well.
2)The applicant may introduce his prior medical records with respect to the 1985 accident subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility.
3)The statement of claim in that action could not be entered at this trial as it was not evidence. 
At best it was a series of allegations made against the prior defendant.
The applicant could examine the respondent as to particulars of her claim in the earlier action and refer to material paragraphs.
4)The applicant was restricted to using the respondent's examination for discovery in the prior action for the purpose of cross-examination.
 5)Costs were reserved to the trial judge. 6)The previous judge did not intend to reserve his decision with respect to the hearing of this motion and there was no impediment to the matter being reargued and disposed of."
37,"Although this Court has ordered that Stella is entitled to exclusive possession of the matrimonial home, it is expected that counsel will assist the parties in determining reasonable time period for Mike to move from the matrimonial home.","FIAT. Exclusive possesson and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner in May 1998.
At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home.
Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home.
He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98.
In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent.
At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules.
The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus.
The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal.
Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15.
HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court.
No case law could be found in support of either party.
It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession."
38,In other words this statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case (or a presumption) that Dr. Huerto\'s billings constituted a departure from a pattern of medical practice acceptable to the Committee.,"Administrative Law - Judicial Review - Bias/Institutional BiasAdministrative Law - Medical Care Insurance - Medical Fees - Repayment - AppealProfessions and Occupations - Physicians and Surgeons - Cardiologist - Medical Fees_____
A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB).
Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence.
The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence.
The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB.
_____
HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed.
The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges.
1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven.
The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision.
The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised.
Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion.
Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues:
The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case.
It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice.
This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee.
The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation.
It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature.
The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'.
To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice.
The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance.
If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue.
There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented.
3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence.
The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data.
The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects.
He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours.
4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76.
The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.
 5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary."
39,"November 16, 1998 [1] The applicant seeks an order staying the hearing scheduled by the respondent Commission for November 19, 1998 to review a decision of the respondent Authority to suspend the applicant`s ""tavern permit"" for a period of three days, until criminal charges arising out of the same facts are disposed of. [4] The applicant requests the stay on the basis: (1) It alleges that for the Commission hearing to proceed would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary for it to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; (2) It states ""it would be manifestly unfair to have decision for potential penalty imposed (sic) by the Commission which may be contradictory to finding of fact and determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provincial Court.""

The applicant hotel was charged with five breaches of s.112(1)of the Alcohol and Gaming Act for failing to demand proof of age from minors.
The hotel was convicted on one charge and the remaining charges were held in abeyance pending its appeal.
The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges.
Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.
1)The second ground raised a substantive issue and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth.
There was nothing inconsistent with the Commission considering a form of disqualification of the applicant's license or permit, while the state exercises its criminal law power with respect to the same set of facts.
2)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence.
The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing will not result in any new facts that were not already known to the Crown."

The insure denied liability on the policy alleging the plaintiff deliberately started the fire or caused it to be started.
HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed.
1)When the evidence of the three independant witnesses was considered, the defendant insurer met the onus referred to Grover Holdings and established that the fire was deliberately set.
While there was no direct evidence to establish the plaintiff set the fire himself, the inference was drawn that he did or, in the alternative, caused someone else to do so.
 2)Had the plaintiff been in the mobile home he should have been suffering to some degree from carbon monoxide poisoning, he should have been coughing, his hair should have been singed, he would have had soot on his face and his clothes would have smelled of smoke. 3)The plaintiff did not call evidence to rebut the fire investigator's opinion that a significant quantity of fire accelerant had been used nor was his brother called to confirm his testimony that he attempted to re-enter the mobile home after arranging for the fire department to be called."
41,"Canadian Paper Workers Union, Local 219, 1986 CanLII 71 (SCC), [1986] S.C.R. 704 Estey, J., for the Court, said at p.717-718: The legislature created the status of the parties 'to collective aareementl in process founded upon solution to labour relations in _a wholly new and statutory framework at the centre of which stands new forum the contract arbitration tribunal The collective agreement establishes the broad parameters of the relationship between the employer and his employees.","The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996.
The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year.
Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries.
In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze.
After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act.
The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation.
The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator.
The Chambers judge dismissed the application.
The employer appealed.
Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue.
Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration.
This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy."
42,"E.V., the complainant’s mother, said that the accused slept downstairs about two-thirds of the time. The complainant’s mother, E.V., testified that she met the accused in May of 1996.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching contrary to s.271(1) and 153 of the Criminal Code.
The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15.
HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts.
1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once.
His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish.
None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor.
The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations."
43,"If the accused was not detained, nor any search begun, until after the accused had said he had two cases of wine in the van, then Cst. McLaughlin had reasonable and probable grounds for conducting at least the initial warrantless search on the roadside as he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe the accused had committed the offence of bringing more than 1.14 litres of wine into the province and exigent circumstances existed in that it was necessary to conduct search before the accused drove away with the evidence. [45] The Crown would suggest Cst. McLaughlin, coming upon vehicle stopped on the side of the road offers assistance and engages in innocuous conversation as result of which the accused makes comment which gives the police officer reasonable and probable grounds to believe an offence has been committed under The Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act.","The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act.
The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police.
A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road.
The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance.
The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists.
The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself.
The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC.
He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine.
The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act.
The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches.
HELD: The evidence is excluded.
The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance.
The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime.
When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got.
The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question.
The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement.
The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation.
The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get.
The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van.
The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law.
The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated.
The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van.
The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.
The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event."

TFPG sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the respondent to return all materials and files respecting TFPG's clients, to cease any contact with its clients, and to make no attempt to solicit any current or prospective client.
HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG.
The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services.
1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.
 2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration.
It was not unconscionable nor against public policy.
The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement.
The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor.
The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm."

But it is to say, in the factual situation of this case, that Council acted unreasonably and arbitrarily and without the degree of fairness, openness, and impartiality required of municipal government [22] The applicants submit that the Town Council has acted in bad faith and in support of their submission point to these several indicia: (1) lack of openness, frankness and candor; (2) advancement of the interests of private individuals rather than the public interest; (3) the selling price of the land is not reasonable; (4) there is pre-existing commitment to the hotel project; and (5) officials of Council had pecuniary interest in the advancement of the hotel project.","In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting.
HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw.
The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor.
It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry.
There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest.
Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open.
The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment.
The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion.
5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside.
The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership.
They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation.
No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent.
The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings.

The respondent has costs at double Column V. The considerations to be applied in a leave to appeal application is 1)whether the issue raised by the proposed appeal is sufficiently important to the litigation before the Court or to the practice in general to warrant consideration by the Court of Appeal. 2)Whether the applicant's proposed submission to the Court of Appeal has sufficient merit to warrant the granting of leave. 3)Whether there is any delay in the proceedings which would be caused by the interjection of an appeal.
Here the applicant has misconstrued the mortgage agreement.
The applicant still has a right to redeem upon payment.
No issue of importance was raised nor did the Court see any merit to the applicant's appeal"
51,"For essentially these reasons—though I expanded upon them in argument, and in my oral disposition of the application—I decided to dismiss the application for release, without prejudice to further application should leave be granted to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on one or more of the grounds raised in the proceedings.","See also 150 SaskR 185.In 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's sentence appeal and appeal of his 1997 convictions which consisted primarily of sexual offences involving family members and others.
The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years.
The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.
He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal.
The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision.
HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted.
1)The application was premature.
The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months.
The Court of Appeal was not satisfied the appeal as a whole was not frivolous having regard for the requirements of s.679(3)(a) and (c).
Some grounds for appeal would clearly fail such as the ground the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment.
The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess on the basis of the incomplete material before the court.

His release would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice."
52,"THE STATUTORY LIMITATION [13] The applicants submit that with the exception of claims based on malice, the action should be struck because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by The Public Officers' Protection Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. [59] In the result, it is ordered as follows: (1) that the applications by the several defendants to have this action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period are dismissed; (2) that the application by the defendants, McGillivray and Johnston, to have the claim in negligence struck as against them is dismissed; (3) that the application by the defendants, Quinney, Sullivan and Bauer, to have the claim in negligence struck as against them is allowed and paragraphs 45, 46, 46A, 47 and 48 of the statement of claim are struck, but without prejudice to the plaintiff to apply to amend the pleadings; (4) that the application by the Government of Saskatchewan is granted in part such that the claim is dismissed against it except for the claims alleging conspiracy and breach of Charter rights; (5) that the application of the plaintiff is allowed and it is ordered that the time to bring the within action is extended to September 10, 1994, said order to be retroactive to September 8, 1994; and (6) that there will be no costs of these proceedings.","FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.
 The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.
 Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police.
The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die.
The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA).
Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired.
The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute.
HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994.
The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed.
Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial.
It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants.
As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code.
Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue.
The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA.
Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural.
The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA.
The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation.
The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute.
2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed.
The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted.
The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general.
3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings.
The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck.
They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose.
4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches.
The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts.
Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence.
If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection.
A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys.
Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.
 5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component.
An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact.
6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset.
The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended.
It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.
 7)No costs."
53,"[22] Requiring that the search be truly incidental to the arrest means that if the justification for the search is to find evidence, there must be some reasonable prospect of securing evidence of the offence for which the accused is being arrested. The right to challenge the legality of search depends upon whether the accused had reasonable expectation of privacy, and if so, whether the search by the police was conducted reasonably.","The accused was charged with ten counts including robbery, aggravated assault, assault causing bodily harm, possession of stolen property and trafficking in narcotics.
She raised s.9 and 8 of the Charter in objecting to the arrest and seizure of the duffel bag.
The voir dire occupied 5 days.
HELD: 1)The four requirements set out in R. v. Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied.
The arrest was lawful.
The search of the house and seizure of the duffel bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful.
2)The accused had no expectation of privacy with respect to either her friend's residence or the bag.
The decision in R. v. Edwards was squarely on point.
There was no evidence tying the accused to the gym bag.
It was of a different description than the one used in the drugstore robbery.
The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it.
The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence.
3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter.
To exclude the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute."

The Trustee sought to have its fees taxed.,fees taxed based on the funds received by the Trustee prior to default.

55,"J. Schindelka for the defendants (plaintiffs by counter-claim), Goldean Enterprises Inc. and P.T. Apothecary Ltd. FIAT MacDONALD J.","FIAT. The issue was whether costs should be assessed against the plaintiffs because the two motions served by the plaintiffs were not filed at the Court House prior to the return date as required by the Queen's Bench Rules;
 the motion filed at the Court House was not served on the defendants; plaintiff's counsel advised the defendants that the two motions which had been served on them were not in fact going to proceed.
HELD: Given the lawyer's representation as to the amount of stress he was under, it would not be appropriate in the circumstances to assess costs against the plaintiffs over the conduct of their counsel or against counsel directly or at this time.
The matter was left to the trial judge."
56,"The learned trial judge erred in law in holding that the appellants as “Indians” within the meaning of the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement, 1930, which forms part of the Constitution of Canada by virtue of the Constitution Act, 1930 did not have an Aboriginal right to hunt with searchlight. According to the expert witness, Kenneth Brian Ness, Reserves were exempt out of respect for the Band Councils’ right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. The trial judge’s conclusion that the questioned regulation was aimed at ensuring safety and did not infringe Aboriginal or Treaty rights to hunt for food was based on established law and the facts.","An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting.
The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity.
The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns.
The facts were not in dispute.
The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land.
The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.
However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety.
At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code.
2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable.
There was no wrong decision on a question of law.
 3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute.
Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights.
Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights.
As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component.
The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws.
Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces.
All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test.
The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable.
Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights.
Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right.
In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied.
No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous.
The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential.
The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik.
The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).
 6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose.
Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act.
7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted.
8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement.
If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation.
It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component.
9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them.
Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary.
They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution.
The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis."
57,"[18] On the evidence before me and that which accept, determine that it would be unsafe to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused sexually assaulted the complainant or touched her for sexual purpose, or at all. In my view, the evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and I was not persuaded, on the total evidence and that which I accept, that the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt, on the Information tried before me, that the accused, P.J.N. between the 19th day of October 2001 and the 19th day of November 2001, sexually assaulted S.D.M. or for a sexual purpose touched her with his hand.","A 14 year old accused her friend's father of touching her breast while she was sleeping over at his residence with her friend.
She also stated that just prior to this she was awakened by the feeling of someone touching her vagina.
The accused was charged with sexual assault and sexual touching of the complainant.,
accused found not guilty;
the complainant's testimony was internally inconsistent and her cross-examination revealed obvious errors which were never corrected to rehabilitate her credit.
The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and the accused's evidence raised reasonable doubts in the court's mind."
58,"He argued that if the Crown had informed him of its intention to call Whitecap to give evidence arrangements could have been made for other counsel to either take over the entire defence or, at the very least, sit in during the trial in order to effectively cross-examine this witness. The Crown’s failure to disclose his intention to call Whitecap as witness has, in my view, seriously damaged the accused’s right to effective representation with respect to the cross-examination of this witness.","The accused was charged with a number of break and enters.
After hearing evidence, the Crown advised the Court that it intended to call 'Ace' to the stand.
Ace had been subpoenaed and had been sitting in the Court listening to other Crown witnesses.
Defence counsel objected and claimed the Crown had not disclosed this witness.
Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace.
HELD: The Crown failed to provide proper disclosure to defence counsel, the non-disclosure had an adverse effect of the accused's ability to make full answer in defence and the appropriate remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call Ace as a witness."
59,He contends however that the evidence that the generator at the appellant’s garage in Watrous was the same one that was taken from the SaskPower storage shed and recovered from the fishing camp at Robert’s Lake is ample if not indeed overwhelming. [17] Counsel for the appellant contends that the learned trial judge failed to provide adequate reasons for convicting the appellant.,"An appeal from conviction and sentence for theft of an electricity generator valued at under $5,000 contrary to Criminal Code s.334(b).
On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction.
The appellant pled not guilty.
Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction.
Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began.
Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal.
The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision.
HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.
 1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.
The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2).
2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession.
The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods.
The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft.
Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly.
There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.
 3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge.
However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines.
If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh."
60,"There is plenty of affidavit evidence to support this: (a) The petitioner admits that “in general, Ryan loves Keanna” and has exercised access to her on fairly regular basis; (b) Both parties have been willing to make arrangements in the past; (c) Efforts have been made by the respondent at contact with the child.","At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support.
HELD: Interim custody was given to the petitioner with access to the respondent.
The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month.
On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo."
61,"not want to exercise access, then the Parties agree that he would not be forced to do so” and further, “[i]t is agreed that the child will refer to the Respondent as ‘Doug’ unless the child desires to do otherwise.” [6] There was also stipulation in the judgment which provided that the petitioner was to provide 90 days’ written notice to the respondent of any proposed change of residence of Dylan.","The respondent seeks an order prohibiting the petitioner from removing her son from Saskatchewan until she obtains a Court order allowing her to do so.
The child is the petitioner's son from a prior relationship.
The petitioner plans to have the child live with his biological father in Edmonton so that he can get the specialized medical care that he requires.
When the petitioner and the respondent separated, they consented to a judgment, which granted the petitioner custody of the child and gave access rights to the respondent.
The consent judgment provided that the petitioner was to provide the respondent with 90 days notice of any proposed change in the child's residence.
Notice of the upcoming move was provided to the respondent.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
The consent judgment does not require the petitioner to get an order before changing the child's residence.
An application will be required by the petitioner to vary the access arrangements with the respondent."

HELD: The application was dismissed.
It was clear that the judge's finding was for procedural purposes only and was not intended to be definitive.
The judge left it open to the Superintendent to proceed with his applications when the McMaster action was finished and that her decision respecting his powers was open to review upon further evidence being adduced."
63,"[15] Sections 3(2) and (3) are as follows: (2) Where person is directed pursuant to this Act, except in respect of proposed adoption, to make an order or determination in the best interests of child, the person shall consider those of the following circumstances that are relevant: (a) the importance for the child’s development of positive relationship with parent or guardian and secure place as member of family; (b) the child’s relationships with relatives; (c) the importance of continuity in the child’s care and the possible effect on the child of the disruption of that continuity; (d) the bonding that exists between the child and the child’s parent or guardian; (e) the child’s physical, mental and emotional needs, and the appropriate care or treatment to meet those needs; (f) the child’s physical, mental and emotional level of development; (g) the child’s cultural, racial and linguistic heritage; (h) the religious faith, if any, in which the child is being raised; (i) the merits of plan for the child’s care proposed by an agency, including proposal that the child be placed for adoption, compared with the merits of the child remaining with or returning to parent or guardian; (j) the child’s views and wishes, if they can be reasonably ascertained; (k) the effect on the child of delay in the disposition of the case; (l) the risk that the child may suffer harm through being removed from, kept away from, returned to or allowed to remain in the care of parent or guardian; (m) the degree of risk, if any, that justified the finding that the child is in need of protective services; (n) any other relevant circumstances.","The chambers judge refused to grant an adoption to a single mother of her own daughter as he determined that the child would not gain anything vis a vis the mother by such an adoption but would lose the potential for a relationship and support from her father.
The evidence before the chambers judge was meagre but showed that the father had not seen the child for the past four years.
The mother appealed.,
appeal dismissed;
the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act.
He did not place too much emphasis on the child's loss of a potential relationship with and support from the father on the facts of this case."
64,"The court ordered the return of the child to the supervised care and custody of the mother and psychological father pending the Protection Hearing provided the Respondents comply with agency recommendations to make the apartment safe for the child, the Respondents participate in education counselling with family support worker to deal with issues of parenting and child safety, the mother submit to random drug and alcohol testing, one of the dogs be removed from the home, the Respondents not allow additional persons to reside in the home with the child and the Respondents permit unscheduled visits to the home by agency workers to monitor compliance with conditions that impacted on the child's safety and well being.","The Agency applied for permanent care of a young child, with no access to the parents.
Each of the mother, the biological father and the psychological father sought to have the child placed in their care.
The child had been apprehended due to unsafe and unhealthy living conditions.
The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses.
The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child.
The mother was against this plan.
The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father.
Child placed in the permanent care of the Agency with no access to the mother or the psychological father; access ordered to the biological father for a period of six months at which time the access order will expire automatically unless an application to vary is made; the Agency is to arrange for a parental capacity assessment of the biological father.
The child continued to be at substantial risk of physical harm due to neglect if she was returned to the mother's care and the child would be at risk of exposure to violence if returned to the psychological father's care due to the tumultuous relationship between the mother and him.
Although some improvements had recently been made in the mother's life, she had a history of frequent changes of residence and did not appear able put the child's needs ahead of her own.
The Agency had not had an opportunity to assess the appropriateness of a placement with the biological father."

66,"Jamie Chiasson Respondent Judge: The Honourable Justice Moira Legere Sers Heard: January 24, 2006; February 23, 2006; March 22, 2006 Written Decision: May 8, 2006 Counsel: Elizabeth Cusack, Q.C., for the Applicant Duncan MacEachern, for the Respondent By the Court: [1] Lise Chiasson commenced divorce proceedings on November 30, 2004.She sought custody, access, child support, spousal support and division of property, in accordance with the Separation Agreement entered into between herself and the Respondent, Jamie Chiasson, dated August 30, 2004. Ms. Chiasson maintains that the Court should use the $60,000.00 figure inserted into the Separation Agreement to justify the amount of child support that the parties decided should be paid to keep Ms. Chiasson and the child in the Cheticamp area.","The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage.
The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment.
The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child.
The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home.
Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs.
Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent.
Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues.
The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills.
Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity.
The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes."
67,"expense, is allowed to take into account ""the reasonableness of such an expense in relation to the means of the spouses."" [31] With regard to apportioning this expense, have considered the following: 1) The expense to Ms. Thomson is actually less than $800.00 as she obtains income tax relief at least with regard to the amount of the $400.00 that she was contributing; 2) While did not consider the parental arrangements such that the children spent 40% of their time with Mr. Thomson, they do spend considerably more time in his care and at his expense than is normally the case in which the Guideline amount is imposed; 3) The evidence discloses that Mr. Thomson does provide additional payments with regard to some of the child care costs.","The parties, who were the parents of two children, separated after a seven year marriage.
For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis.
In the divorce proceeding, the mother, who planned to remarry and relocate, sought to become the primary caregiver of the children, with the father to have access only every second weekend.
The father sought to vary the parenting time so that both parents would equally share their time with the children.
Current parenting arrangement to remain in effect with the parties retaining joint custody of the children; table amount of child support set.
The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base."
68,"Accordingly, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent as support for Keandra Frass, born October 15, 1996, the sum of $625.00 per month and 71% of special or extraordinary expenses as hereafter described.","FIAT: The issues on this application are with respect to extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousal support.
HELD: 1)
The petitioner's income is $73,000 versus $29,000 for the respondent.
The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2)
The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law.
At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law.
What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents?
Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support?
2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.
 3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse.
These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI.
These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case.
However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim.
In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders.
In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700.
The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future."
69,"Leedahl, 2006 SKQB 14 (CanLII);[2006] S.J. No. 15 (QL) (Q.B.), former husband sought to vary his spousal support obligation reached by agreement following settlement pre-trial conference and incorporated into consent order. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference in paragraphs 7.3 and 7.5 to adjustments which “will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul’s contract is renewed with the Provincial Government.” [13] As noted in Palmer, supra, when the Court is asked to make an interim order and there is an existing interspousal contract which deals with spousal support, it is often not feasible to apply the Miglin, supra, analysis.","The petitioner seeks child and spousal support.
The parties signed a separation agreement and interspousal contract in July 2004.
With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1)
The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum.
The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance.
It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'.
This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support.
The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist.
2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program.
Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year.
The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006.
It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000.
Child support will be ordered based on $53,000 on an interim basis."
70,"(2) On an application pursuant to this section, the court may make any order it considers appropriate, including: (a) an order restraining director or auditor whose election or appointment is challenged from acting pending determination of the dispute; (b) an order declaring the result of the disputed election or appointment; (c) an order requiring new election or appointment and including directions for the management of the activities and affairs of the corporation until new election is held or appointment made; (d) an order determining the voting rights of members and of persons claiming to have membership interests.","FIAT: In October 2005, a referendum was held within the student body of the University of Saskatchewan to determine whether the University of Saskatchewan Students Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students and its related corporation, the Canadian Federation of Students-Services.
The result favoured joining the federation.
The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995 seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum.
HELD: 1)
The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable.
In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations.
In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice?
This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues.
The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer?
2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice.
When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome.
Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice.
The applicant is entitled to a portion of the relief he seeks.
The referendum held by the USSU on the issue of whether it should join the CFS is of no force or effect."
71,"Contract to Auction forms part of the contractual fabric between the parties, or whether, as the plaintiff insists, the terms of the contract were settled by the December 23, 2003 agreement and are to be found partly in writing, and partly in oral representations made by the defendant, LeBlanc Auction Services Ltd. 7) If the March 28, 2004 agreement represents the entire contract between the parties, the next issue is whether the prohibition against the owner bidding directly or indirectly at auction was transgressed when one Orval Caruk, Tkachuk relative and the successful bidder on several large pieces of equipment, was later discovered to have (1) commercial relationship with the plaintiff (leasing all the plaintiff’s cattle), and (2) the benefit of 100% financing from his uncle, Taras Tkachuk, for the sole and express purpose of making the impugned equipment purchase.","The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit.
The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500.
The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie).
The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie.
After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price.
The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds.
The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit.
HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf.
The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit.
A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public.
The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit.
2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit.
It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid.
It actively facilitated bidding.
Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment.
The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose.
It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs.
The plaintiff corporation benefited.
It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract.
'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner.
3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction.
That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information.
He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle.
All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered.
He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4)
In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation.
The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants.
In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.
 5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages.
The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized.
The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6)
The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract.
The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum.
The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument.
The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7)
The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff.
In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs."
72,"Thirdly, even if you are not left in doubt by the evidence of the accused, you must ask yourself whether, on the basis of the evidence which you do accept, you are convinced beyond reasonable doubt by that evidence of the guilt of the accused.” [4] According to Mr. Colley, Roger Simmons got out of his truck and walked toward him with the knife in his hand.","Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction.
The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground.
The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib.
The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence.
Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge.
The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant."
73,"(2) If the applicant has demonstrated material change in the conditions, means, needs or other circumstances of the child, the court must decide whether the material change is such that the best interests of the child require variation of the order. 14 It is well established that before court should consider the merits of an application for variation of custody, the court must be satisfied that there has been material change in the circumstances of the child since the last custody order was made (Wilson v.","The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent.
HELD: 1)
The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12.
In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child.
There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother.
It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed.
Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2)
The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated.
It may well be that the child truly does wish a change.
It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent.
3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order.
There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children.
No material change has been demonstrated.
The application is dismissed."
74,"Campbell, 2008 NSSC 310 Date: 20081024 Docket: SH 213071 Registry: Halifax Between: Force Construction Limited Plaintiff/ Defendant by Counterclaim and Tammy Campbell Defendant/ Plaintiff by Counterclaim DECISION ON COSTS Judge: The Honourable Justice Kevin Coady Heard: March 3-7, 2008 April 2, 2008, in Halifax, Nova Scotia Written Submissions: September 8, 2008 September 29, 2008 Decision: October 24, 2008 Counsel: Cory Withrow, for the plaintiff Allen Fownes, for the defendant By the Court: [1] This trial was heard over seven days in early March and early April, 2008.","Despite the court's finding of no clear winner and that both parties had contributed to the circumstances that led to the trial, the plaintiff sought costs on the basis that the defendant had refused its offer to settle.
Each party will bear their own costs;
the court had no confidence that any offer made by either party, short of 100 per cent vindication, could have resolved the case in advance of trial."
75,"9. Constable Epp spoke to the accused in the patrol car and told him that he was no longer under arrest, but that he would still be detained, that he could contact counsel at the police station, and that he could provide statement after he talked to his lawyer. Everyone has the right on arrest or detention a) to be informed promptly of the reasons therefor; [26] The position of the accused is that when the accused was “un-arrested” by Constable Epp, but, nonetheless, detained in custody, that his detention was arbitrary and unlawful, and the subsequent “processing” by Sergeant Johnson was an unlawful, and unreasonable, search and seizure by her, being neither pursuant to warrant, nor incident to lawful arrest.","The accused is charged with aggravated assault.
A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached.
HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights.
1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel.
The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead.
When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'.
The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel.
There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.
 2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest.
It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'.
It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused.
The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release.
The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station.
The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest.
3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'.
The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter."
76,"The relief sought was as follows: (a) declaration that Jill Strueby, born December 16, 1981 and Luke Strueby born May 29, 1986, are no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act; (b) As result of the two said children no longer being children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act, that no further child support is owing by the applicant for these children as of January 1, 2007; (c) An Order eliminating the Applicant’s child support arrears as at the time of the application in the amount of $17,400.00, for the period of March 2003 to September 2007; (d) An Order that the Respondent’s obligation to pay proportional amount of post secondary school expenses for the child of the marriage, Keegan Strueby, born November 13, 1989, be fixed based upon the applicant’s income of $44,781.00 and the Petitioner’s income; and (e) An Order that any maintenance for Keegan Strueby be paid directly to Keegan.","FIAT: The parties have three children, Jill born December 1981, Luke born May 1986 and Keegan born November 1989.
The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own.
The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university.
The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order.
HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008.
The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university.
2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion.
Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation."
77,"After the father of Katie and Hannah, S.T., returned to live with the mother in November, 2005, concern arose regarding S.T. According to Christine Kelleher, the child protection worker assigned to this file, the Ministry had the mother and father agree that S.T. would have no unsupervised time with the children. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children, Katie and Bobby, who had special needs.","The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006.
The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years.
The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care.
In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions.
The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act.
HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act.
There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years.
There shall also be an order with respect to access.
It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process.
First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11.
If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children.
The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them.
The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA.
They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children.
The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands.
The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result.
If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act.
The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs.
The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children.
Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive.
Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act.
The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection.
Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care.
Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion.
Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home.
The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities.
Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change.
She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it.
For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act.
The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years.
The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act.
All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother.
However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements.
In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor.
The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old.
There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years.
The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act.
Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives.
An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case.
The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future."
78,"On or about March 9, 2004, following trial, the Defendant, Maurice Couture, was convicted of the criminal offence of assault causing bodily harm to the Plaintiff contrary to s. v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29 (CanLII), [2002] S.C.R. 3) [15] Whereas in the civil proceeding which is now before the court, Mr. Windrem as the plaintiff is in a position to control the presentation of his case and must prove his case on a balance of probabilities.","The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs of the amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of claim to remain would be an abuse of process.
The paragraphs of the amended statement of claim at issue deal with the fact that the plaintiff alleges he was assaulted by the defendant and sustained bodily harm.
The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal.
The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings.
HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed.
1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.
 2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings.
In the civil proceeding, the plaintiff is in a position to control the presentation of his case and must prove his case on a balance of probabilities.
The onus of proving self-defence is on the defendant.
He bears the onus of proving the assault was justified and was made with reasonable force."
79,"Part III of the Act is entitled Equalization and Regional Disparities, and contains this single section (with relevant portions highlighted): Commitment to promote equal opportunities (1) Without altering the legislative authority of Parliament or of the provincial legislatures, or the rights of any of them with respect to the exercise of their legislative authority, Parliament and the legislatures, together with the government of Canada and the provincial governments, are committed to (a) promoting equal opportunities for the well‑being of Canadians; (b) furthering economic development to reduce disparity in opportunities; and (c) providing essential public services of reasonable quality to all Canadians. The Municipality does not create justiciable issue by referring in the claim to s.36 of the Constitution Act, when the commitments set out in that section do not alter the Nova Scotia Legislature’s right to exercise legislative authority.","The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972).
At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities.
Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect.
The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36.
The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed.
Appeal dismissed.
The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim.
The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application).
Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck.
While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities.
Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced.
On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it."
80,"Potter, for the Respondent By the Court: (Orally) [1] This matter involves an application under Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an Order in the nature of Mandamus compelling the Respondent, Department of Community Services to comply with an Order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board, dated September 17th, 2007.","The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board.
The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information.
He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated.
The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information.
Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated.
He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement.
Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board.
The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected.
It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision.
To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless.
As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision."
81,Mike shall provide Kaira to Lesly by 9:30 a.m. of the 28th day of his parenting if Lesly wants to parent in Regina or to her parents for the purposes of transporting Kaira to Victoria if Lesly wants to parent in Victoria. Lesly shall advise Mike if Kaira will on each occasion be transported to Victoria for parenting time with her.,"FIAT: This is an application to determine interim parenting for the child, Kaira, who is 2.5 years old.
There is conflicting information about the nature and extent of the petitioner father's parenting duties.
The respondent has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school.
She applies as the primary parent to have the child go with her.
The petitioner would like Kaira to remain in Saskatchewan and have regular contact with each parent on alternating weeks.
HELD: 1) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina.
The Court cannot determine on conflicting affidavits what the primary parent status quo is.
2) It is in the best interest that the child see both parents.
There was a similar course in Saskatoon that the respondent could have taken which would have made more frequent changes possible, but her affidavit indicates she thinks the Saskatoon course is inferior to the one she is taking in Victoria.
3) Pending trial the child shall be parented by the petitioner for 28 days, and thereafter by the respondent for 28 days and such parenting shall continue to alternate for each 28 day period thereafter until further order.
The costs of transportation shall be born primarily by the respondent."
82,"The notebooks of those officers not involved in gathering information involved in the issuance of the search warrants and those not testifying at trial do not have to be provided in hard copy but, of course, they are still available to the defence through the electronic disclosure.","The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances.
The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'.
The motion has two components.
The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'.
The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided. 
The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1)
There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence.
In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos.
The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer.
The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested.
The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2)
The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld.
The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available.
What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit.
This information is often crucial for the defence.
3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks.
It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order.
In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.
 4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure."
83,"(11) In any application by landlord for possession of rental unit, the tenant may also request an order of relief pursuant to this section and hearing officer may grant that relief if it appears to the hearing officer that: (a) notice to end the tenancy agreement was given to the tenant because of the tenant’s good faith complaint to the director or to any other agency of the Government of Saskatchewan, the Government of Canada or municipality alleging the contravention of any Act, bylaw or other law dealing with health or safety standards, including housing standards; (b) notice to end the tenancy agreement was given to the tenant because of the tenant’s attempt to secure or enforce the tenant’s rights pursuant to this Act; (c) the landlord has contravened provision of the tenancy agreement or has contravened any standard condition; or (d) notice to the end the tenancy agreement was given to the tenant for non-payment of rent pursuant to section 57 and the hearing officer is satisfied that: (i) the non-payment of rent relates to amounts that are the result of an increase to the rent and the landlord increased the rent for the purpose of enabling the landlord to end the tenancy; and (ii) it is just and equitable for the order to be made.","The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession.
The landlords are mother and son.
The mother lives out of province for a number of years.
She returns in summers to reside in the premises.
This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis.
She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease.
She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises.
The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords.
He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises.
HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement.
The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant.
In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute.
However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1)
A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy.
2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement.
Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion.
There was no express consent of principal and agent.
 3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel.
This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person.
The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf."
84,"The issue is whether person named Kevin Callele had the authority under The Fisheries Act to prohibit Mr. Paulsen from applying for or obtaining an angling licence. However, if defence is correct and Mr. Callele had no authority to prohibit Mr. Paulsen from applying for fishing licence, counts 1, and must fail and the burden of proof issue under section 35 becomes irrelevant.","The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations.
The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional.
The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license.
A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch.
The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one.
The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations.
The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door.
The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door.
HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations.
Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act.
The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.'
Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail.
There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act.
The accused was acquitted of all three counts.
It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue."
85,"Alternatively, if Lawrence is found to be person of sufficient interest, Melodie says that access is not in Trista’s best interests. of the Act. Because of the familial relationship among Lawrence, Melodie and Trista, the expectations of Lawrence are not so onerous.","The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married.
The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship.
The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to.
There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children.
The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997.
HELD: The application for access is dismissed.
In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child.
The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life.
The community viewed them generally as father and daughter.
However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her.
This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life.
The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means.
Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child."
86,"Wlaswich was not given any details of the terms of the contract with the German miller and did not know the quantity of oats that was to be delivered in total, the quality requirements and the price to be paid to Bio Canada. According to Wlaswich and Bio Canada at the time of delivery of the oats, the quality requirements of the contract had been met.","The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats.
The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content.
The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content.
In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany.
When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content.
The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation.
HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant.
The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality.
The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff.
There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff.
The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company.
The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs."
87,"Factors courts rightly use include: the general prejudice to the accused; the legal and factual nexus between the counts; the complexity of the evidence; whether the accused intends to testify on one count but not another; the possibility of inconsistent verdicts; the desire to avoid multiplicity of proceedings; the use of similar fact evidence at trial; the length of the trial having regard to the evidence to be called; the potential prejudice to the accused with respect to the right to be tried within reasonable time; and the existence of antagonistic defences as between co-accused persons [7] Defence counsel has predicated his submissions on the proposition that the Crown has combined all the counts in one indictment to gain two strategic advantages, namely, to improve its evidentiary position because of the unproven connection of possession of the gun on both days in question, and also to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of April 8th if he should decide he wishes to testify on the events of April 14th.","The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed.
First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order.
It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day.
The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events.
The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates.
Application for severance dismissed.
The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn.
The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events."
88,"[Unreported reasons, dated October 28, 2008.] [8] The trial judge accepted Cst. Lariviere’s evidence that he had been afraid, but he concluded that Cst. Lariviere misinterpreted Mr. Severight’s actions and had not been listening to what Mr. Severight was saying: [13] The defendant testified that he felt threatened by having this large man turn around and advance toward him, pointing his finger, however Mr. Severight had stopped and turned around because Constable Lariviere himself had said ""Stop, where are you going?"".","The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a).
The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered.
The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial.
The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review.
HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored.
The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent.
The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning.
While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so.
The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate.
The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another.
An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others."
89,"[4] At approximately 8:00 a.m., the officer observed black Mustang vehicle accelerate quickly from red light at the intersection of Thatcher Drive West and Woodlily East. The accused’s vehicle was travelling one hundred and forty kilometres per hour, well over twice the posted speed limit in this portion of Thatcher Drive one lane each way.","The accused was charged with dangerous driving.
The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light.
The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr.
The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr.
The intersection was near a church and school yard.
There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred.
HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving.
The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway.
The bend in the road adds to the danger.
The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate.
His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver."

91,"When Elmer Schmidt, who was travelling west on Highway 306 near Grey, Saskatchewan, saw car driven by Margaret Henry approach from his right, stop at the stop sign, and then proceed forward toward the highway, he applied his brakes with such force that his truck entered skid, left the highway, and struck the side of the car. However, although Henry complied with the rules of the road, a prudent driver in this situation would come to a stop further back from the highway to ensure that oncoming drivers would know that they had been seen and yielded to.","The parties were involved in an accident.
The defendant stopped at a stop sign 39 feet from the intersection and rolled forward while yielding.
The plaintiff locked his brakes and skidded into the defendant, attempting to avoid an accident.
Damage to both vehicles exceeded the insurance deductibles and both parties claim damages against each other for the amount of the deductibles.
HELD: The plaintiff will have judgment against the defendant in the amount of $50.
The defendant will have judgment against the plaintiff in the amount of $450 plus costs.
Fault for this accident was attributed 10% to the defendant and 90% to the plaintiff.
The defendant had indeed yielded properly but could have been more prudent in insuring that other motorist were aware that she yielded.

92,"[40] For the foregoing reasons, I find it in the children‘s best interests that they be in the joint custody of [C.O.] and [K.O.] and that they reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. [44] In this case as well, there was no evidence of the increased cost that would be incurred by [C.O.] and [K.O.] as result of sharing custody of the children.","The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support.
Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP.
The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act.
2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks.
The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home.
Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children.
3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent.
The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month.
The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable.
Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases.
It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time.
The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable.
There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs."
93,"[5] What this application ignores and there have been others recently, is the consistent case law which states the courts should not vary interim custody arrangements whether legal or de facto in the absence of evidence that the child or children are in some way at risk, or other compelling reason. The foregoing case law indicates that once an interim custody arrangement has been in place for some time, whether de facto, by court order, or by agreement of the parties, the non-primary care parent should not apply on an interim basis to vary the arrangement (except where risk to the child exists), but proceed to final order.","FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage,and in the alternative a variation in access.
The father counter applied for interim custody.
The parties agreed in 1997 that the father should have interim custody.
The mother argued that she was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization for unipolar/clinical depression.
The father had been employed as a long distance trucker but now worked days in the city.
HELD: The applications for custody were dismissed.
Overnight access was granted to the mother.
1)The application ignored the consistent law which states the courts should not vary interim custody arrangements whether legal or de facto in the absence of evidence that the child(ren) are in some way at risk, or other compelling reason.
It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child.
The non-primary care parent should proceed to final order which in this provicne means obtaining a pre-trial date for a pre-trial conference and proceed to trial if custody is not resolved at that stage.
2)The court was satisfied on the basis of a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health was stable that the child was not at risk if the mother were granted overnight access."

The parties were married in January 1991 with three children and ceased to cohabit in December of 1996.
The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed.
In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind.
He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month.
The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home.
The petitioner and children live in that home.
The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic.
The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income.
The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month.
HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500.
There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage.
In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue.
Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support."
95,"have done so, because as Sergeant Miles Burke the lead investigator acknowledged, the blood sample they obtained from the accused was not taken pursuant to the consent, but rather pursuant to the warrant issued by Provincial Court Judge Campbell.","The accused was charged with the sexual assault of his 13 year old step-daughter, which led to her impregnation.
Blood was drawn from the complainant and her infant daughter, as well as the accused pursuant to a warrant.
The accused challenged the validity of the warrant.
He contended that a warrant could only be issued for comparison purposes with a bodily substance found in circumstances described in section 487.05(b) of the Criminal Code, which, he alleged, did not include a bodily substance created by virtue of the conception of a child.
Admitting the evidence,
that the DNA of a baby born as a result of a sexual assault is a bodily substance for the purposes of section 487.05(b) despite the fact that the child did not exist at the time of the offence."
96,"(In Chambers): [1] Labourers’ International Union of North America, Local 1115, (hereinafter called the Union) applies for leave to obtain intervener status as a party, or as amicus curiae, or alternatively as an intervener, and to bring an appeal from orders made on September 23 and October 1, 1999, by Justice Tidman of the Supreme Court, in proceedings brought by Dexter Construction Co. Limited (Dexter), Intended Plaintiff, against Persons Unnamed, Intended Defendant(s).","The respondent filed an interlocutory notice, ex parte application, against the intended defendants, seeking an interim injunction.
The applicant union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Rule 62.35, or as amicus currie pursuant to Rule 8.02, or alternatively as an intervener pursuant to Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1), and to bring an appeal from orders made by a Supreme Court judge in proceedings brought by the intended plaintiff against the intended defendants.
Rejecting the applications,
that a Court of Appeal judge sitting in chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status or to join a person as a party to a proceeding.
Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal."
97,"I am persuaded however, that the prior ownership of the home by Sharon and its occupancy by her many children, the economic imbalance between Edward and Sharon and the brevity of the marriage combine to make this an out of the ordinary or unusual case.","Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue.
The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months.
HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000.
The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances.
However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case.
The home was to remain in the petitioner's name.
It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage.
Five of those children still lived with her in the home.
The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage.
2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed.
One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax.
The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property."
98,The City then appealed to the Saskatchewan Municipal Board Assessment Appeals Committee (the “Committee”) to ask for further increase.,"The landowner appealed an assessment for taxation purposes to the City Board of Revision alleging it was too high.
No cross-appeal was filed by the City but the Board increased the assessment.
The City then appealed to the Saskatchewan Municipal Board Assessment Appeals Committee to ask for a further increase.
There was no-cross appeal by the owner.
The Committee concluded the Board erred, having no jurisdiction to make an increase, and restored the original value.
Leave to appeal was granted with respect to whether the Committee erred in making an order respecting issues not raised by the notice of intention to appeal; in ruling the assessed value cannot be increased where the board orders correction of errors in the assessment; if not, whether the Committee erred in jurisdiction in failing to apply s.263.2 of the Urban Municipality Act.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double column V to the respondent.
The Committee was correct in concluding the Board had no jurisdiction to make the order.
It was asked to affirm what was in essence a nullity."
99,"(1) Whether the pillars at the front of the house are an extra; (2) Whether the entire cost of installing steam room was properly charged to the plaintiff; (3) Whether the plaintiff is liable to pay for any extras; (4) Whether the defendant is liable for any deficiencies; (5) Whether the defendant is liable for loss of rental income because of delay. [34] For the reasons stated, hold that the plaintiff was wrongly charged for the cost of round pillars in the sum of $5,900.00 and for the steam room he was charged an excessive amount of $2,597.82.","The plaintiff claimed damages for failure to perform as agreed in constructing a residence.
Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower.
The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff.
HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61.
The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim.
1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract.
They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for.
2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost.
3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant.
Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment.
The charges were found to be fit and proper.
4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies.
5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties.
The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest.
He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.
 6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000.
It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to."
100,"Mabel informed the plaintiff of the instructions, written on January 26, which had been delivered to Brenda. ALLEGED TRUST [17] The plaintiff has submitted that the written instructions by Mabel to Brenda to prepare four cheques of $5,000.00 to each of the granddaughters constituted the establishment of a trust, and that Brenda thereupon became the trustee, for the benefit of the four granddaughters, of the sum of $20,000.00.","Plaintiff, as litigation guardian for his four daughters, alleged that the defendant, in breach of a trust, wrongfully retained $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled.
Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account.
Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter.
The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children.
The money was never issued to the granddaughters.
The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters.
HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2.
An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer.
Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust.
She intended to make monetary gifts.
The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust.
As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven.
Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs."
101,The trial judge did not accept Kapronczai's denial that he and Tania knew that the wheelchair lift was not part of the realty or was owned by the Abilities Council.,"An appeal from Provincial Court on a Small Claim.
The Jabours, the third parties who acquired title to the house, firmly bolted a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Abilities Council by anchor bolts in a concrete slab.
The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift.
The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift.
San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party.
1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed.
It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty.
The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty.
2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.
 3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty.
Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land.
It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty.
The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs giving a claim for damages.
The Provincial Court judge dismissed the claim against the third party, the Jabours, on the facts."
102,"The reference reads: The purpose of the following sign regulations is to: (a) support commercial use as ability to attract solid customer base; and (b) maintain the character of the Town by minimizing the adverse impacts of signs on adjacent properties and the street scape; [12] As stated, the objectives of the by-laws in the McCarthy Sign case are similar to the objectives of the by-laws in this proceeding, and are found to be pressing and substantial.","The applicant applied for an order directing the removal of a ground sign which violated its' Municipal Planning Strategy and Land Use By-laws.
The respondents argued that the applicant's by-law violated their rights under s. 2(b) of the Charter.
Application allowed; respondents directed to remove the ground sign; if the sign is not removed within fifteen days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents.
Although advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of sec. 2(b) of the Charter, the purposes of the by-laws (maintaining a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown, minimizing adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reducing safety concerns) were both pressing and substantial and the limiting measures were rationally connected to the objectives.
The by-laws had a minimal impairment on the rights of the respondents, as advertising was not prohibited but only limited."
103,"am not aware of any decision of the Supreme Court of Canada that states this expanded scope of judicial review of decisions of statutory tribunals as developed in Lester and the other cases referred to ought to be applied to the judicial review of decisions of consensual arbitrators dealing with grievance filed under collective agreement and protected by no review clause. Justice L’Heureux-Dubé concluded that the error in interpretation of an employee’s status during strike made by the learned arbitrator was jurisdictional and that the Court had duty to intervene., She relied on decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in cases involving the judicial review of decisions of statutory tribunals rather than consensual arbitrators.","A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage.
The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease.
The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity.
The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision.
Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision.
The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel.
Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable.
The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable."
104,"[3] The parties have two children: their son will be six years of age in June and their daughter will four years of age in May. They have always resided in the matrimonial home with their parents in Richmond, until the 3rd day of November, 2000, when the petitioner removed them from the matrimonial home and brought them to Regina.","The mother sought interim custody of their 3 and 5 year olds or primary residence of the children pursuant to s.6 of the Children's Law Act.
 The father sought a declaration declining jurisdiction, or an order for joint custody.
HELD: The children had a real and substantial connection with British Columbia and evidence of their best interests was available there.
They were not habitually resident in Saskatchewan and had been here only 3 months.
They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father.
The uncontradicted evidence that the mother never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home was accepted.
The Court would have declined to exercise jurisdiction in any event pursuant to s.16 since it was more appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in BC.
The father was directed to forthwith file an undertaking to not disturb the status quo until court authorization has been obtained."
105,"Brian Gibson DATE HEARD: December 3, 2001 PLACE HEARD: Dartmouth, Nova Scotia CHARGES: 12 counts under S.238(1) of the Income Tax Act. COUNSEL: David Bright, for the Crown Kent Clarke, for the Defence [1] Mr. Paul Henneberry has pled guilty to 12 counts of failing to comply with the provisions of subsection 153(1) of the Income Tax Act by failing to remit to the Receiver General of Canada, money deducted and withheld from salaries, wages or other remuneration paid to the employees of Halifax Regional Protection Services Limited (herein referred to H.R.P.S.).","The defendant plead guilty for failing to comply with s. 153(1) of the Income Tax Act for failing to remit to the Receiver General of Canada money deducted and withheld from salaries, wages, or other remuneration paid to its employees.
A fine was imposed pursuant to s. 238(1) of the Act.
The defendant had filed for bankruptcy and argued that under s.168.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, he is discharged from all debts except matters referred to in subsection 178(1) of that Act.S. 238(1) of the Income Tax Act, falls within the definition of any fines, penalties, and restitution order as set out in s. 178(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. 
The Court's jurisdiction to make an order pursuant to s. 238(1) of the Income Tax Act is unaffected by a bankruptcy proceeding."
106,"The reasons which provided when giving that decision canvassed the involvement of Mr. Redling and other persons in the OSB in relation to Mr. Black’s affairs, and explained the basis upon which determined that Mr Redling was unlikely to be able to provide relevant or material evidence concerning issues raised by the Charter Motions.","The accused, charged with fraud, brought a motion to stay the proceedings on the basis that his Charter rights had been violated by the RCMP and the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy.
The accused asked the court to reconsider its decision to quash a subpoena issued to the former Superintendent of Bankruptcy on the basis of testimony presented from other witnesses after the subpoena was quashed.
Application dismissed;
the accused had not met the onus on the balance of probabilities of establishing that the former Superintendent had relevant or material evidence to offer concerning the issues raised by the Charter motions.
The subsequent testimony and documentation did not support the accused's allegations concerning the former Superintendent's motives or conduct."
107,"Fichaud, Q.C., for the defendants By the Court: [1] Counsel have been unable to agree on costs in this proceeding where, after four day trial, the plaintiffs were successful in recovering the base amount claimed but did not succeed in their claims for aggravated and punitive damages.","Following a four day trial, the plaintiffs were successful in the recovery of the sum of $29,150 against the defendant.
Under the usual tariff, costs would be fixed at $4,725.
The plaintiffs sought substantially increased costs on the basis that the defendant should have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial.
Solicitor and client fees totaled over $21,000.
Costs fixed at $10,000 plus disbursements;
there was no obligation on the defendant to admit liability but considering the amount of legal fees incurred in relation to the amount recovered, it was appropriate to go outside the tariffs."
108,"The portions of section 48 that are relevant are as follows: 48 Where consumer product is sold by retail seller, the following warranties are deemed to be given by the retail seller to the consumer: (d) that the product supplied under the contract is of acceptable quality, except that this warranty is deemed not to be given: (i) respecting defects specifically drawn to the consumer’s attention before the contract is made; or (ii) where the consumer examines the product before the contract is made, respecting defects that examination ought to have revealed; (e) where the consumer expressly or by implication makes known to the retail seller any particular purpose for which the product is being bought, that the product supplied under the contract is reasonably fit for that purpose, whether or not that is purpose for which the product is commonly supplied, except that this warranty is deemed not to be given where the circumstances show that: (i) the consumer does not rely on the retail seller’s skill or judgment; or (ii) it is unreasonable for the consumer to rely on the retail seller’s skill or judgment; (g) that the product and all its components are to be durable for reasonable period, having regard to all the relevant circumstances of the sale, including: (i) the description and nature of the product; (ii) the purchase price; (iii) the express warranties of the retail seller or manufacturer; and (iv) the necessary maintenance the product normally requires and the manner in which it has been used; [21] am satisfied that the engine and transmission mounts of this vehicle were in the same condition on the date of sale as there were in on August 15th, being the date upon which Mr. Dillabough inspected the vehicle.","The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b).
Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600.
The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'.
The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on.
The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement.
Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair.
The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts.
At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act.
HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven.
1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA.
If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group.
Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive.
It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality.
The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so.
The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation.
It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time).
3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character.
4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period.
The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product.
The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed."
109,"[15] On January 20, 1997 Mr. Mabey was the sole signatory to the following document: Whereas Melissa Mabey, daughter of Susan Mabey and Stephen Mabey, needs to obtain additional United States Federal Plus Loan (hereafter referred to as “Loan”) for the sole purpose of completing her undergraduate education at Boston College; And, whereas the Loan can only be obtained by citizen of the United States, And, whereas Susan Mabey as citizen of the United States qualifies to apply for the Loan on behalf of Melissa Mabey; And whereas Section 10 (a) of the Divorce Settlement Agreement dated June 1996 between Susan Mabey and Stephen Mabey sets out the following responsibility for the initial United States Federal Plus Loan: The Husband herein shall as between the parties to this Agreement, be responsible for its repayment and his sole recourse shall be against Melissa Mabey. [18] The second aspect of Ms. Mabey’s application seeks “A retroactive child support order concerning the child, Melissa Sue Mabey ...","The husband applied to have the wife's application for retroactive child support to cover the costs of the child's post-secondary education struck as a matter more properly addressed as an issue of contract.
In addition to the child support ordered in the Corollary Relief Judgment, the husband had signed a document in which he agreed to repay the costs of the daughter's American student loans (which had to be obtained in the wife's name as the wife was an American).
The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation.
Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'.
There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties."
110,"By fiat of May 27, 2004, I ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine a representative of 609 for discovery and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action.","FIAT: By fiat of December 5, 2002, Gerein C.J. authorized the initiation of a derivative action by Dale Henry (Henry) on behalf of 609897 Saskatchewan Ltd. (609).
By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action.
In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought.
HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action.
The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage.
Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609.
Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action.
It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609.
Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action.
As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs.
Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609."
111,Counsel for Mr. Overs has asserted that Janice Petersen should be required to produce her father’s farming accounts.,"FIAT: The issue to be resolved was whether the petitioner had produced all relevant financial information in order for the Court to determine the amount of maintenance to be paid by her.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs in the amount of $500 to the petitioner.
Neither the petitioner's father nor the petitioner's husband was a party to the proceedings.
To require them to produce their financial records, in the absence of even the slightest evidence such production would disclose anything which would in any manner assist in determining the amount of child maintenance payable by the petitioner, would be totally unjust."
112,"[17] For the purposes of this proceeding, subsections 22, 24 (1), and 24 (2), of the Act are relevant and read as follows: 22 (1) Unprofessional conduct is question of fact, but any matter, conduct or thing, whether or not disgraceful or dishonourable, is unprofessional conduct within the meaning of this Act if it is (a) harmful to the best interests of the public, licensed persons or the Commission; (b) fraudulent; (c) breach of this Act, the regulations or the by-laws or any terms or restrictions to which licence is subject; or (d) failure to comply with an order of the Discipline Committee (2) Whether or not person is in breach of this Act, the regulations or the by-laws is question of fact, but if person displays (a) lack of knowledge, skill or judgment; or (b) disregard for the welfare of members of the public served by the real estate industry, of nature or to an extent that demonstrates that the person is unfit to continue to be licensed pursuant to this Act, that person is in breach of this Act, the regulations or the by-laws for the purpose of this Act. 24 (1) Any person may appeal from any order made by the Discipline Committee to judge of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia within thirty days after the order is made, and the judge, on hearing the appeal, may make such order either confirming, amending or setting aside the order appealed from or for further inquiries by the Discipline Committee into the facts of the case as to the judge seems right.","A real estate agent sold a condominium to an American and agreed to rent it for her for a fee.
He deposited a security deposit and rent in his personal account and used it for personal living expenses.
When the owner inquired, he caused a false lease to be provided to her showing the rental commencing two months later than it actually did; he then failed to remit some rent and was late remitting other rent.
He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission.
At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible.
The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000.
The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed.
Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision.
It is patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions; reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible as to set out the reasoning process of the tribunal and demonstrate a consideration of all of the relevant factors."
113,"The question of what is in the best interests of these children in these circumstances must be seen not only in terms of their day to day care, but in the context of how Justice Dellapinna’s Order has been changed in de facto way by Ms. Bourque. The existing child support Order will be terminated as of January 1, 2005 and replaced by provision that commencing January 15, 2005 and the 15th day of each month through and including June 15, 2005, Mr. Lemire will pay Ms. Bourque the table amount of child support for two children based on $33,996.00 (or $481.00 per month).","The court had previously ordered interim joint custody of the child, with the primary residence being with the mother.

The father applied for interim custody and the mother replied, seeking sole custody.

The mother's decision to move was not in the children's best interests and it was done either to frustrate or with a callous indifference to the children's relationship with their father."
114,"The second said that “his condition is adversely affected by emotional stress and, and it may be to his advantage to appoint someone to act on his behalf in his impending court case.” [3] At trial, the appellant appeared with friend, Mr. Hawke, and told the court that he was incapable of representing himself and that he needed lawyer.","The appellant appeared for his trial in a family law matter.
He refused to participate and left.
The judge ordered that the trial continue without him.
A judgment was rendered, dividing the matrimonial property and dismissing the appellant's claim for maintenance.
The appellant now appeals on the ground that the trial should not have proceeded without him.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed.
1) There is no error in the decision of the trial judge.
The medical evidence did not indicate any inability to either instruct counsel or to represent him in Court.
The trial judge had little choice but to do what she did.
2) The authorities cited by the appellant have no application to this case as they all deal with situations where someone did not appear at his trial.
In this case, the appellant appeared but refused to participate.
For the same reason, Queen's Bench Rule 271 has no application."

The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian.
The accused did exercise due diligence."
116,"When I consider those explanations together with the uncertainty of the police officer as to whether or not she had alcohol in her system at the time she read her the ASD demand, I am unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused is charged with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and impaired driving contrary to s. s. 253(b) and 255(1) of the Code.
HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.
 1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it.
Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand.
There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith.
The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached.
2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand.
The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system.
When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving.
The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand.
The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.
As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).
 3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle.
She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station.
She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired.
The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving.
There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving."
117,"In addition to his application in Saskatchewan under the Act, he pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 19, 2005 obtained an order which, inter alia, dissolved the marriage, ordered the respondent to return Joshua to the State of Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody.","FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003.
They are married and the family home is in Connecticut.
The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan.
The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut.
HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.
 1) The child was born in Canada.
He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003.
In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit.
It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child.
In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner.
Reconciliation was attempted.
The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned.
The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada.
For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence.
At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles.
The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy.
Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut.
The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home.
2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut.
He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody.
The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody.
The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate.
Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut.
This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return."
118,"Pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act A.L.H. applies for a change in the primary care arrangements, and M.R.H. requests a dismissal of the current application to vary in order to preserve the present arrangement vesting primary and day to day care and control of the children with him, subject to access times with their mother.","Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances.
When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care.
The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability.
The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time.
The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children.
Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication."
119,"Kelly, for the respondent Decision: [1] The appellant appeals from and applies for a stay of execution of an order setting aside her petition for divorce made by Justice Darryl W.","Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas.
He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding.
The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision.
She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here.
She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned.
Application for stay pending appeal dismissed;
the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here.
Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there.
Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20."
120,"OTHER ISSUES [99] Mr. Luke’s counsel’s request for relief included the following: inclusion of prohibition on the mother interfering with the father’s access with the children by encouraging the children to reject the father’s access plans, making plans that overlap with the father’s access plans; inclusion of limit to two calls per week by the mother to the children during their access with the father; inclusion of prohibition on the mother sending emails to the children which criticise the father, his wife, his wife’s children or extended family, as well as prohibition of the mother sending emails to third parties which are derogatory to the father or his family; an order allowing the father to deduct from the child support payable to the mother for the month of June 2007, for the following: (a) parking tickets in the total amount of $415.00; (b) penalty due to Armbrae as result of April’s failure to return book during her final year of school at Armbrae Academy in the amount of $125.00.","The parties, divorced, had children, aged 23, 19, and 14 years, respectively.
The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support.
The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment.
The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed.
Both parties applied to vary child support.
The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school.
Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses.
The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies.
The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months.
Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years.
The father will pay 25 per cent of the core university costs which are not covered by the plan for the middle child as well as the difference in the Table amount of support for two children versus one child; the father shall pay the Table amount of support for one child to the wife for the youngest child as well as that child's expenses for private school; the wife will be responsible for any extra-curricular activities or tutoring outside the private school; the youngest child will be entitled to the same post-secondary benefits in the same fashion as the two older children; the CRJ is amended to provide that the two oldest children are in the joint care of their parents and will not include any other reference to custody or access; the husband is entitled to specified block access with the youngest child; if flight arrangements are made for this child and she does not fly (and there is no medical reason confirmed in writing by a doctor for that failure), the husband's block access shall be expanded for one week at the next access period and the cost of any penalty from the missed flight will be deducted dollar for dollar from the child support payable by the husband."
121,"[42] The inspection of public buildings in Nova Scotia constructed with open web steel joists fabricated by Robb Engineering resulted in the determination 2.28% of joists had at least one failed joint, that is, at least one cracked or non-welded joint. 5. An inspection of the welding of the open web steel joists in the Mayflower Mall indicated the welding was of greater concern than the welding typically found on other Robb Engineering joists in Nova Scotia.","Following the collapse of the roofs of two buildings in Newfoundland, both of which were constructed with open web steel joists fabricated by the same company, the Nova Scotia government wrote to owners of buildings containing these joists, including the plaintiff mall owner, recommending that the joists be inspected by a qualified professional engineer.
An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended.
The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists.
The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger.
Judgment for the plaintiff;
there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger.
There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations."
122,"[9] The mere fact the proposed intervenor has additional arguments to make is not determinative of the issue.[6] However, I see no prejudice to the respondent if the applicant’s proposed arguments are presented to the Court on the appeal.","The applicant seeks leave to intervene in this appeal.
The application is made pursuant to Rule 17 of The Court of Appeal Rules.
HELD: The application for intervention is allowed on condition that it meet the filing deadline, that its material not exceed 12 pages and that it may make oral argument only if requested to do so by the Court.
 1) The intervenor is a non-profit corporation and its members are mutual fund dealers.
Its stated purpose is to regulate the mutual fund distribution industry and its members contractually bind themselves to submit to regulation by the Association.
It contends its purpose in bringing the application is to bring to the Court's attention 'some of the broader policy and contextual considerations that have informed the development of the Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA) and the self-regulatory organizations (SROs) generally.
2) There is no prejudice to the respondent if the applicant's proposed arguments are presented to the Court on the appeal.
The applicant's arguments should simply put the regulatory scheme in context and may assist the Court in its deliberations.
The applicant's arguments are confined to a relatively narrow issue."
123,"“offence-related property” means, with the exception of controlled substance, any property, within or outside Canada, (a) by means of or in respect of which designated substance offence is committed, (b) that is used in any manner in connection with the commission of designated substance offence, or (c) that is intended for use for the purpose of committing designated substance offence; [Emphasis added] (1) Subject to sections 18 to 19.1, where person is convicted of designated substance offence and, on application of the Attorney General, the court is satisfied, on balance of probabilities, that any property is offence-related property and that the offence was committed in relation to that property, the court shall (b) in the case of any other offence-related property, (i) where the prosecution of the offence was commenced at the instance of the government of province and conducted by or on behalf of that government, order that the property be forfeited to Her Majesty in right of that province and disposed of by the Attorney General or Solicitor General of that province in accordance with the law, and (3) person who has been convicted of designated substance offence or the Attorney General may appeal to the court of appeal from an order or failure to make an order under subsection (1) as if the appeal were an appeal against the sentence imposed on the person in respect of the offence.","The respondent was convicted of having in his possession a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and was sentenced to a term of incarceration of 9 months with a 10 year firearms prohibition.
The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them.
The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.'
HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal.
1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed.
2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed.
The truck is ordered forfeited.
1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.
 2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA.
It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence.
The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA.
Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration.
However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited.
The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person.
In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession.
The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so.
He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property."
124,"August 14, 2007 [1] The plaintiff brings this action against nine defendants (the claim against the defendant Albert Fazakas has been discontinued) who can be separated into four groups: (a) Dwayne Walbaum All-Rite Plumbing Heating Ltd. Tamwal Investments Ltd. Tammy Walbaum (herein “the Walbaum Group”) (b) Robert Sim Rosemary (Turner) Sim (herein “the Sims”) (c) Gabriel Construction Ltd.","FIAT: The defendants, Sims, Garbriel and Dumurs, bring separate motions, pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 41(a), for severance of the claims against them or for an order staying the claims against them until the plaintiffs' claim against the primary defendant, Walbaum have been heard and decided.
HELD: 1)
The Court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether to grant an application for severance.
 In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials.
Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.
 2) The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than 1 day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or Dumurs.
It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them.
Specific dates and times should be set aside for the plaintiff to call evidence with respect to its claims against each applicant group.
The applicants should be relieved from attending the trial at any other time."
125,[4] The issue on appeal is whether the circumstantial evidence which led the trial judge to conclude Fleury was travelling on Highway #11was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.,"The appellant appeals his conviction of dangerous driving.
The police did not see the appellant driving; they came across his minivan immersed in a slough in excess of 35 feet off the highway.
Based on the tire tracks, the appellant was charged with dangerous driving.
The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.
The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign.
In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described.
HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.
While no accident reconstructionist was available to check the accident scene after the incident, the Crown could have called an expert to testify whether the defence's theory could hypothetically be rational.
However, no expert was called.
The appeal is allowed and the conviction set aside."
126,"THE CHILD SUPPORT [16] Based on an annual gross income of $41,834.50, the respondent should have paid to the petitioner as support for two children the monthly sum of $564.00 commencing September 1, 2005. [38] This is the money owing by the respondent: Description Amount Child support for June, 2004 300.00 Child support for September, 2005 to June, 2006 337.12 Extraordinary expenses $2,857.00 Travelling expenses of petitioner [39] In the result it is ordered as follows: (1) That the respondent shall pay to the petitioner the sum of $4,237.16; (2) That the said sum of $4,237.16 shall be paid by monthly payments of $350.00 commencing November 1, 2007; (3) That no child support is presently payable as incomes are comparable, but each party shall pay 50% of all extraordinary expenses; (4) That by May 30 of each year copy of the income tax return for the previous year shall be provided by each party to the other party; and (5) That the respondent shall forthwith pay to the petitioner as court costs the sum of $1,200.00.","The outstanding issue is child support, past and future.
The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past.
Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income.
HELD: 1)
The respondent is a farmer.
His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made.
The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment.
However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose.
It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income.
In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support.
The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%.
An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added.
The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528.
As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005.
2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe.
This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused.
The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally.
It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now.
3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support.
The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable.
3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access.
She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.
 4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200."

Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months.
The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary.
The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery."

Appeal dismissed;
the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress.
The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation."
130,"Foley, 2002 NFCA 46 (CanLII), [2002] N.J. No. 216 case involving Defects found in home Chief Justice Wells of the Newfoundland Court of Appeal made the following observations of the Law: (b) As to liability of vendor to purchaser on discovery of defect subsequent to completion of the sale 25 The common law, in England, as to the duty and potential liability of vendor in contract for the sale of land can be conveniently summarized by quoting the following excerpts from Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. 42, 4th ed., (London: Butterworths, 1983).","The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding. 
Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt.
She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation.
When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony.
Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed;
it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation.
The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries.
There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot.
Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem."

The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould.
It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting.
Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased;
the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings.
The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it."
132,"[2] On the conviction appeal the appellant raises technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence provided in the testimony of the Crown’s expert witness on accident reconstruction. As such an application was not raised in this case, the questioning about previous criminal convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant’s previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant’s own examination-in-chief, it is my conclusion that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that that cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.","The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code.
He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand.
The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence.
On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction.
He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
 1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988]
1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case.
This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case.
See R. v. Underwood, [1998]
1 S.C.R. 77.
As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.
 2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'.
Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them.
Defence counsel did not object to them.
However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.
 3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction.
No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed.
This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4)
The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code.
The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a).
There is no merit in this ground of appeal.
Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner.
5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable.
In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving.
The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence.
Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice.
The appeal from conviction is dismissed.
6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment.
While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case."
133,"Mr. Sutherland’s responsibility to safeguard employees from risks associated with that manure pit arise under section 13(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act. The Act also requires, under section 17(1), that every employee, while at work, shall ""take every reasonable precaution in the circumstances to protect the employee’s own health and safety...at or near the workplace."" [3] On August 13, 2006, Gary Boake, nineteen years old, met ghastly and tragic death.","The defendant farmer pled guilty to failing to take every precaution that was reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons in the workplace, after a young employee drowned in a manure pit that was not properly secured due to a damaged barricade having been removed while a new one was on order.
Defendant sentenced to fine of $25,000, from which the sum of $15,000 shall be paid to the Canadian Farmers' Disability Registry; defendant ordered to perform 160 hours of community service with respect to farm safety.
The defendant was an individual and not a huge corporation, had been conscientious about safety issues prior to this incident and had endeavored to improve safety at his farm after the incident; the deceased had also failed in his responsibilities under the Act and was working with a significant blood alcohol content."
134,"[17] As stated, the essence of Mr. Grady\'s argument that he should not be bound by clause 9 of the separation agreement is that his income (1) has taken a dramatic and unanticipated drop; and (2) forced him to abandon the parties’ shared parenting arrangement with resulting tax consequences for him.","The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008.
It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time.
At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment.
The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support.
He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement.
The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce.
The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008).
The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable.
He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife.
The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement.
This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act.
It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome).
The terms of the agreement must be given great deference.
Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act?
The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made.
Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult.
Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated.
Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party.
To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them.
The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it.
The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements.
His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges)."
135,"[14] As well, although there was no evidence as to the precise time that it became dark on September 29, 2007, the first sighting of Mr. Kenny’s vehicle by the surveillance aircraft was approximately 11:45 p.m. If when he picked up the hunting party it was, in his words, “getting dark”, at the very least, at the time he was first observed, he had to have been looking for Mr. Black for two hours.","Mr. Kenny is charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with use of a searchlight when hunting.
Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2)
For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife.
The case was decided on the basis of credibility.
The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused.
The Court stated that, on all the evidence, it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife.
HELD: The accused is guilty as charged."
136,"[20] Notwithstanding the possibility of a contrary interpretation, in accordance with the submission on behalf of CNH on this application, it seems clear that objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the NHCC security would have priority over the TD security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by New Holland but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit.","In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals.
In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR).
Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer.
Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH).
The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH.
The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts.
The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies.
HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for.
The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit.
But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.
 2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue.
It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH.
The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA).
While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act.
The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings.
The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts.
However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances.
It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer.
The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out.
The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer.
The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered.
They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers."
137,When McIntyre went to the door to have look he testified that Dagenais was doing more damage to the car and Mayer was rushing up the stairs toward the trailer. [11] Corfmat testified that as McIntyre drove slowly by Rockcees Mayer jumped off the sidewalk and kicked in the front passenger window.,"The accused were both charged with assault contrary to s. 266.
The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.'
HELD: The accused were convicted of assault.
Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout.
He smashed one, if not two, car windows.
The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize.
The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code. 
While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault.
The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows."
138,"[37] have therefore concluded that while there may be some prejudice that the defendant has suffered in mounting its case if the matter goes to trial as result of the unavailability of Laird Allary, nevertheless the degree of involvement of Ms. Bellanger throughout the years and the Ochapowace Band records, together with the examination for discovery the defendant conducted of Mr. Guylas and perhaps other sources, should not disarm the defendant from conducting its defence.","The defendant applied for dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution.
The claim was issued November 1, 1999 and is based in debt for goods and services provided to the defendant.
The value of the claim is $521,283.99 and refers to provision of materials, products and services in 1995 and 1996.
The statement of defence was filed November 12, 1999 and amended in 2002.
In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary.
A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48.
In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases.
The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided.
Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference.
There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case.
The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short.
While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance.
Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial.
The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action.
The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied."
139,"THE POSSESSION OF STOLEN PROPERTY INVESTIGATION [19] While the two police officers were conferring in Cst. Warner’s vehicle, the accused remained in the motor home. (ii) when he was detained for an offence under the Controlled Drug and Substances Act before the deployment of the drug sniffer dog [82] I have earlier determined that the observations made by the police officers which caused them to reasonably suspect the accused was hauling contraband in his motor home were a product of their search incidental to his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property.","The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles.
The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars.
The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000.
The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times.
The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol.
The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol.
The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver.
Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome.
The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous.
The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs.
The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new.
He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match.
He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match.
The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen.
The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property.
As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified.
A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome.
The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs.
The accused was arrested for trafficking.
The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking.
Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment.
That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer.
The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2).
HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled.
The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to.
The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen.
The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs.
The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification.
He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query.
Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband.
In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition.
The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8.
By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs.
However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog.
Section 9 Ã» 
The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused.
He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen.
His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent.
The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property.
The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property.
The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property.
Section 10 Ã» 
The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion.
However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer.
There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs.
The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2).
The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious.
The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest.
His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements.
The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious.
These two factors favor excluding the evidence.
The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs.
The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case.
The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence.
On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount."
140,"Apart from the police officer whose testimony and photographs documented the scene and the injuries suffered by the victim, the only other witnesses were the appellant, Ms. Deviller and Mr. LeBlanc. [11] In the end, Justice Bryson accepted Mr. LeBlanc’s evidence as to what had occurred, accepted Ms. Deviller’s evidence as to who strangled the victim, and rejected the appellant’s testimony and denials of responsibility.","The defendant, who was in a very small apartment with two other individuals, got up from the couch and proceeded through a doorway behind the complainant, purportedly to use the bathroom.
A few minutes later, the complainant found something wrapped around his neck and he was choked until he passed out.
When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him.
She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back.
The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat.
Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door.
Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay.
When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked.
She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest.
Appeal dismissed;
 it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility.
Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence.
The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony."
141,[24] The Applicant and the Respondent have argued that the public has an interest in and expects personal identifier information contained in court documents to be protected in order to prevent identity theft.,"Rule 85.04 – Order for confidentiality
The parties moved under Rule 59.60 to have the court seal their file after media asked to view it.
They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.
 , the file will be sealed.
While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does.
The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies.
A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs.
Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough.
Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents).
Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern.
The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place).
There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff.
The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered.
The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation."
142,"32 of the Small Claims Court Act. The adjudicator cannot confer jurisdiction on this Court, the Supreme Court, to entertain an appeal of an interlocutory ruling. [17] I decline to hear the appeal and refer the matter back for a continuation before the same Small Claims Court adjudicator who made the ruling on the preliminary motion.","A small claims adjudicator determined he had jurisdiction to hear the respondent's application for a review of his rent increase.
He adjourned the matter and asked that it return to him for a hearing on the merits.
The appellant appealed.
At issue was whether the appeal was properly before the court or premature.
There was also an issue concerning the admissibility of an affidavit that wasn't before the adjudicator at the original proceeding.
Appeal dismissed and matter returned for a continuation of the hearing on the merits before the same adjudicator.
The court has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal on an interlocutory decision of this nature.
There can be no appeal from the Small Claims Court until a final determination is made.

Schedule “A” Custodial Arrangement/ Decision Making 1) The children are to be in the joint custody of the Father and the Mother meaning, unless stated otherwise, both parents are to share equal responsibility and authority in making decisions which shall be considered to include decisions about significant health, dental and mental health issues; counseling; religious instruction; and enrollment in recreational activities.","The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.
 The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody.
She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together.
The level of conflict between the two was high.
Each lived with new partners.
They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall.
The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support.
She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did.
Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months.
This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off.
The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated.
While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not.
The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help).
If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody.
On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children.
The father will pay child support in the set-off amount.
While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her.
It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation.
Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated.
It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father.
She's not entitled to spousal support.
Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children."
144,"4(3) of the Canadian Criminal Code, Mr. Carvery was not in possession of the drugs when arrested, but moments after being observed taking something out of the pink baggy and handing it to Mr. Burke, who then left the alley, he went around the back of 2388 and his silhouette could be seen by Constable Marriott a few feet behind the building in the area where the drugs were stashed in the wall.","The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking.
He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction.
After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building.
Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand.
The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged.
A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket.
Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level.
The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall.
Accused found guilty on both counts;
the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction.
The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation.
Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest."
145,"[30] In review, I am absolutely satisfied of the following facts: 1) at the time the individuals got into the truck, Ms. Neigel was behind the wheel; 2) at no point did anyone other than Ms. Neigel have operation of that vehicle; she was the one who backed it out, and again pulled it forward; 3) at no time did any individual exit the vehicle, after getting in the vehicle as observed by the police; 4) keys were in fact in the vehicle, and it was running, as the police came to the driver’s side door; 5) Ms. Neigel’s blood alcohol level exceeded the permitted amount (count 2).","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.
08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop.
The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time.
The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar.
The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up.
The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle.
The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle.
The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck.
HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count.
The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date.
The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability.
The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward.
The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door.
The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood."
146,"752.1(1) of Code states as follows: 752.1 (1) On application by the prosecutor, if the court is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds to believe that an offender who is convicted of serious personal injury offence or an offence referred to in paragraph 753.1(2)(a) might be found to be dangerous offender under section 753 or long-term offender under section 753.1, the court shall, by order in writing, before sentence is imposed, remand the offender, for period not exceeding 60 days, to the custody of person designated by the court who can perform an assessment or have an assessment performed by experts for use as evidence in an application under section 753 or 753.1.","The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code.
The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender.
The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender.
The accused was 50 years old.
He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions.
Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers.
He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order.
The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion.
The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer.
The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect.
The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm.
The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family.
HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752.
The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage.
The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage.
Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established.
The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future.
The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour.
Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.
 It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender.
The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered."
147,"Other indicia which the learned trial judge overlooked or down-played include: The officer’s suspicion that in making full U-turn prior to reaching the intersection Mr. Knoedler was attempting to evade the approaching police vehicle; The U-turn within 100 metres of the intersection of two provincial highways was an unlawful manoeuvre which constituted some evidence of erratic driving; Mr. Knoedler’s excuse for making the U-turn does not justify making this illegal manoeuvre; Mr. Knoedler’s explanation that after spending the day in Gerald he was trying to return to Gerald from Esterhazy in order to re-orient himself so that he could find his way home to Weyburn defies logic; Being lost may be result of being impaired; Mr. Knoedler immediately exited from his vehicle and walked toward the police car—conduct which Cst. Lockyer described as typical for drivers who are drinking or impaired; Mr. Knoedler’s use of mints which Cst. Lockyer explained is something people do to mask the odour of liquor on their breath; Mr. Knoedler admitted to consuming alcohol hours earlier, yet still had the smell of alcohol on his breath; Mr. Knoedler consistently expressed confusion about events as they were unfolding—which is also consistent with impairment by alcohol; Cst. Lockyer was herself qualified breathalyzer technician and for the past three years was dedicated traffic enforcement officer tasked with detecting and prosecuting impaired drivers; Cst. Lockyer’s training and experience led her to the conclusion that in these circumstances an ASD demand was inappropriate given that she honestly believed, based on her observations at the roadside and after placing Mr. Knoedler in the police car, that his ability to operate vehicle was impaired by alcohol and that she had reasonable and probable grounds to make breathalyzer demand; Cst. Skinner’s observation that at the police detachment Mr. Knoedler walked slowly and without stumbling does not contradict the fact that on the highway he stumbled and fell shoulder first into his truck; There was evidence that Mr. Knoedler was wearing big boots but no evidence that his boots were muddy or that this accounted for his slow gait; Being co-operative is not necessarily an indication of being sober.","The Crown appealed the respondent's acquittal on a charge of driving over .08.
The Crown alleged that the trial judge erred in law by excluding two breath samples taken following the respondent's arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights.
During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence.
HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered.
The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter.
The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand.
The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts.
The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case.
The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects."
148,"[7] In their Notice of Application in Chambers, the Sheas requested declaration that there were entitled to right-of-way across the land of the Bowsers and were seeking mandatory injunction and permanent injunction as well as damages for the loss of use and enjoyment of their properties and were seeking costs on solicitor client basis.","Rule 77.03 – Liability for costsThe court found in favor of the respondents after a half-day chambers hearing.
They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim.
Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two.
This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing.
While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs.
The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner."
149,"Summary: The Court concluded the Respondent should pay costs of $3,000 Keywords: Costs; custody and child support Legislation: Costs and Fees Act, R.S.N.S., 1989, c.104 and Rule 77 Cases Considered: L.(N.D.) v. Pelrine, 2007 NSSC 123 (CanLII), 2007 NSSC 123, decision of this court dated April 18, 2007, considered the issue of costs claimed by both parties, following divorce proceeding which was heard over four days.","Rule 77.01 – Scope of Rule 77
This is a costs decision following litigation between the mother and father regarding apportionment of custody and access rights, quantification of child support and special expenses for the parties' children.
The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.
 Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father.
The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay.
The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77.
Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs."

Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial,
that the trial judge erred in (1) failing to instruct the jury that nothing short of the accused's subjective foresight of death could found a conviction; (2) instructing the jury they could return a first degree murder conviction on the basis of s.231(5) of the Criminal Code; and (3) failing to give adequate instructions on the defence of drunkenness.

152,"The appellant candidly admitted that R.B. had refused to give a statement to Mr. Knox: P.W.B. also said that he did not know for certain what evidence R.B. would give and was not at all sure that the latter would say that he had assaulted the complainant on more than one occasion. P.W.B. now states that both Mr. Knox and the Crown prosecutor, Mr. McCarroll, advised him that he had absolutely lost his right to jury trial by failing to appear for his trial in May. The appellant submitted before us that he was not told by his counsel of the provisions of Code s.","The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years.
The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena.
The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial.
He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued.
The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial.
The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear.
He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial.
Dismissing the appeal,
(1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences."
153,"Dealing first with the issue of arbitrary arrest, the ground of appeal in this regard states: That the learned Provincial Court Judge erred in law by admitting evidence obtained by the police as result of the police violating the defendants Charter of Rights by arbitrarily detaining him contrary to Section of the Charter when the police arrested him with view to questioning him in connection with an after hours club that was under investigation.","The appellant was detained after leaving a suspected 'after hours' club which was under surveillance by police.
He was charged with a breathalyzer offence, and was convicted.
He appealed, arguing his s. 9 Charter rights had been violated.
He also contended the evidence of the amount of alcohol he had consumed on the night in question constituted 'evidence to the contrary' which rebutted the presumption in s. 258 of the Criminal Code.
Dismissing the appeal,
that the police officers were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion when they detained the appellant, and had a reasonable basis for stopping his vehicle.
The appellant's contention he consumed only two small bottles (1-1/2 ounces each) of rum, plus some cough syrup and mints, did not constitute evidence to the contrary to rebut the presumption of the breathalyzer offence.
On Appeal."

(11) At 17:00 hours upon being returned to the police station, the appellant advised Constable Coughlin that he wanted to see his sister C., his girlfriend L., his former girlfriend M.G. and his friend C.H., in private so that he could discuss with them giving statement to the police concerning the break and enter at the [name of school changed].","This was an appeal by a young offender who was convicted of nine charges of break and enter and one charge of assault.

Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial,
that both the appellant's sister and girlfriend gave evidence of inducements by the police to the accused to admit to the alleged crimes, in return for a lighter sentence.
The trial judge failed to address this evidence, thereby committing a palpable and overriding error."
155,"On this appeal, the appellant raises three issues:  (1) Whether the trial judge erred in failing to give effect to the submission of Crown counsel that an intermittent sentence was appropriate. H. Randall PLACE HEARD: Halifax City Court DATE HEARD: October 31st, 1994 CHARGE: That he did at or near Halifax in the County of Halifax, Province of Nova Scotia, on or about the 7th day of June, 1994 unlawfully operate motor vehicle on public street or highway in manner that was dangerous to the public having regard to all the circumstances contrary to Section 249(3) of the Criminal Code.","After an argument with his girlfriend, the appellant drove his car at high speed with the lights off, running two stop signs.
At the second intersection he collided with another vehicle, causing serious injury to three people.
He pleaded guilty to three counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm; the Crown proposed an intermittent sentence, but the judge sentenced him to nine months incarceration concurrent on each count plus two years probation with conditions.
The appellant appealed on the grounds the judge failed to consider the Crown's recommendation, failed to sufficiently state his reasons, and the sentence was excessive.
Dismissing the appeal,
that the sentencing power of a judge is not limited by Crown submissions, that the failure to state every reason does not constitute and error, and that in view of the appellant's record and other factors, the sentence was not excessive to the point of constituting a reversible error."
156,"Such an order is ""final"" and appealable by stated case."" A declaration of a mistrial and the setting down of the information for trial before another judge does not put an end to the proceeding which the information began.","The appellant appealed a decision of the trial judge declaring a mistrial in his summary offence trial and setting a new date for trial because the Crown had not disclosed a police record.
 He argued the judge erred by not ordering a stay of proceedings and/or a dismissal at the beginning of the trial, and by failing to find the non-disclosure violated his rights under s. 11(d) of the Charter.
He sought a stay of proceedings in this action.
Dismissing the appeal,
that a declaration is not an 'order' under s. 813(a)(i) of the Code in that it does not bring a final end to the matter.
It is therefore not appealable."
157,"The ground on which this application is brought is that the applicant\'s security interest was not registered defectively, according to The Personal Property Security Act Regulations. 66(1) of The Personal Property Security Act find that the financing statement of the applicant is validly registered.","Saskatchewan Economic Development Corporation (SEDCO) made a business loan to Fladseth, but misspelled her name in its PPSA registration as Eladseth.
It also properly registered against her trade name, 'Joan E. Craft Supplies'.
After her assignment in bankruptcy, the trustee disallowed Sedco's security on the basis that its registration was defective.
Sedco appealed this decision under section 135 of the Bankruptcy Act.
ISSUES: 1)Did Sedco register its interest in accordance with the PPSA Regulations?
2)If not, can the registration be cured under section 66 of the PPSA?
HELD: 1)The personal registration did not comply with the PPSA Regulations.
The registration against the trade name was proper.
2)This is a matter where section 66 should be applied.

He did nothing while his father was alive to demand or obtain payment.
4)Even if the mortgage was considered a debt in 1989 it was subsequently forgiven.
It was significant that the plaintiff was not included as a beneficiary and the amount of the mortgage was similar to the bequests to the other children.
5)The plaintiff was awarded his costs against the estate on a party and party basis for that portion of his claim on which he was successful and for defending the counterclaim.
Solicitor and client costs against the estate were not appropriate as the issues raised by the claim and counterclaim were not typical estate issues.
Judgment issued against the two executors in their representative capacity."
168,"As in many bankruptcies, they have both been poor business managers for example, Dr. Dominic at the outset of the bankruptcy declared $371,450.00 of unsecured creditors, but the trustee has determined that the actual amount is $138,109.70 of which $11,764.74 is the claim of Revenue Canada.","Two doctors filed in bankruptcy in 1995 and in each case the major unsecured creditor was Revenue Canada.
Neither met the 50% threshold of ss.173(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and each likely committed one or more acts of bankruptcy under ss.(b) to (m).
However there was no suggestion of dishonesty.
The combined medical earnings in the four years prior to the bankruptcy averaged $18,000 per month and the after-tax family income averaged $10,200 per month.
HELD: A consent judgment under ss.172(2)(c) was ordered such that if each doctor consented to the payment of $45,000 to be paid at a rate of $1,250.00 per month for 36 months without interest there would be an absolute discharge.
1)The payments proposed by Revenue Canada of $3,349.00 per month were unreasonably high in all the circumstances.
2)Their contributions to the community did not relieve either doctor from making reasonable payments to the trustee as a condition of their discharge from the bankruptcy."

She relied upon Civil Procedure Rules 15.07 and 15.08.
Dismissing the appeal,
that the appellant's application was an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her current circumstances.

The interim maintenance order will terminate with the payment for December, 1997; 3.(a) Subject to subparagraph (b) hereof, Ron shall pay Margaret by way of maintenance, the lump sum of $18,000.00 which shall be made on or before June 30, 1998.","The petitioner sought spousal maintenance.
The parties, now 56 and 61, were married in 1961 and separated in 1994.
The wife had part of Grade 9 and the parties had agreed she would stay home and raise the four children.
HELD: 1)Judgment for divorce was to be issued in the usual form after January 1/98.
2)The respondent was to pay as maintenance a lump sum of $18,000 free from any income tax.
The interim maintenance order was to terminate with payment for December 1997.
The wife could find employment but at a rate at or near minimum wage.
She had no motivation to work, having convinced herself that there was no work available and that her health did not permit it.
The wife would benefit from having bridge income until she attained age 60 in 2001.
Her half of the matrimonial property included a share of a superannuation program.
 3)The respondent was to pay $1,000 as costs to the petitioner."
171,"Very briefly, the Petitioners allege (and Ashton admits): (a) that the three Petitioners, Ashton, and three other individuals were equal members of two real estate partnerships; (b) that the KW Properties partnership was governed by written partnership agreement, while the Key West Carleton partnership had no written partnership agreement; (c) that the two real estate partnerships owned real estate properties and owed money to various lenders on mortgages registered against these properties; (d) that the partnerships very frequently ran short of funds to meet their mortgage payments and subsequently called upon the seven partners to contribute additional monies to the partnerships for that purpose; (e) that Ashton frequently did not contribute the additional monies required of him by the partnerships.","Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them.
The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages.
The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them.
The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife.
HELD: A receiving order was granted.
1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations.
It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993.
The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.
 2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996.
The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions."
172,"(2) For the purposes of this rule, ""litigation guardian"" means: (a) property guardian appointed pursuant to The Dependent Adults Act with authority to commence, defend, compromise or settle any legal proceeding that relates to the estate of the dependent adult; (b) personal guardian appointed pursuant to The Dependent Adults Act with the authority to commence, defend, compromise or settle any legal proceeding that does not relate to the estate of the dependent adult; (c) the property guardian of person in respect of whom certificate of incompetence has been issued and is in effect pursuant to The Mentally Disordered Persons Act; (d) until the court orders otherwise; (i) the Public Trustee; or (ii) any other person the court considers suitable; who has been served pursuant to section 32 of The Public Trustee Act on behalf of person who may be of unsound mind and who has no guardian with authority to commence, defend, compromise or settle any legal proceeding relating to the person or the estate of the person, as the case may be; (e) the litigation guardian of minor who has reached the age of majority; or (f) any other person appointed by the court.","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. who was alleged to be of unsound mind.
H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing.
The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself.
An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act.
The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order.
1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved.
Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult.
The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings.
2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected.
If the court failed to intervene H.B. will be left in limbo, a victim of the system."
173,"Rule 63.19(1) of the Civil Procedure Rules requires the filing of Contingency Fee Agreement and it states as follows: ""63.19 (1) Within ten days after it is signed, copy of an agreement referred to in rule 63.17 shall be filed with the Prothonotary of the county where the solicitor practices, and the Prothonotary shall file the agreement separately from any proceeding, and, unless the court otherwise orders, the agreement is not available for inspection by, or its contents shall not be communicated to any person, other than the client, solicitor, or taxing officer engaged in the taxation.","The applicant sought approval of the Court for a settlement reached on behalf of the infant plaintiff, who had been injured in an automobile accident.
Part of the order sought provided for the payment of solicitor fees by way of a contingency fee agreement negotiated with the applicant.
The contingency fee agreement was never filed with the prothonotary.
Granting the order relating to the settlement amount, but setting aside the contingency fee agreement,
that Civil Procedure Rule 63.19(1) requires that all contingency fee agreements be filed with the prothonotary.
As this was not done, the applicant's solicitor is only entitled to compensation as would have been payable in the absence of the contingency agreement."
174,"The terms of the probation order are affirmed save and except condition which is amended to read: Pay Restitution in the amount of $8,518 directly to Mr. Hal Schmidt, c/o Family Pizza, Bay #10, 318 105th Street, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, S7N 1Z3 at the rate of at least $200 per month commencing in December 1, 1997 until the full amount is paid.","The Crown appealed the six month conditional sentence with 45 months probation and a restitution order for the offence of stealing money in excess of $5,000 contrary to s334(a).

Both parents sought sole custody of the one child who had been living alternate weeks with each since June 1997.
HELD: 1)The present shared parenting arrangement was to continue until the mother was available for full-time child care.
The father would have access on alternating weekends and for a three hour period one weekday provided the child was returned by the bedtime set by the mother.
Although both parents genuinely love the child and were equally competent caregivers, neither demonstrated that sole parenting offered an advantage to him.
Both had full time jobs.
2)When the mother assumes sole custody the father must pay child support of $226 per month and proportionate share of horse riding lessons ($28 per month)."
176,"[2] Rule 547 reads in part: 547(1) Where plaintiff in any action or issue, or the petitioner or applicant in any proceeding by way of originating notice resides out of Saskatchewan, or, although temporarily resident within Saskatchewan is ordinarily resident out of Saskatchewan, or where under the provisions of any statute defendant may be entitled to security for costs, and the defendant by himself or his agent alleges by affidavit that he has good defence on the merits and stating the nature of such defence, the defendant shall be entitled to serve notice of motion for an order requiring the plaintiff within time to be limited by the court to give security for the defendant's costs in such amount and in such manner and form as the court may direct. v. Brown (1985), 48 C.P.C. 150 (Ont. S.C.) for authority that where there is more than one plaintiff and their claims are joint, security will not be ordered from non-resident plaintiff where there is plaintiff within the jurisdiction.","FIAT. SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan.
HELD: The motion was dismissed.
 1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply.
Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan.
Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application.
The action was commenced in April 1996.
Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order.
To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.
 3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause."
177,"The remaining action was between Turf Masters, by then called Granview, the City, and third party indemnity claim by the City against CBCL which alleged negligence or negligent misrepresentation on the part of CBCL.","The plaintiff was subcontracted by the City of Dartmouth to build a sports field.
The defendant were the project consultants for the City, and were involved throughout the tendering process and construction.
Their report indicated a number of significant potential problems.
The plaintiff was not made aware of the report when it bid on the project.
The plaintiff subsequently became aware of the problems, which made their work more costly.
After completing the work, it commenced a claim for the additional work which had to be performed due to the undisclosed site conditions.
The defendants were joined by the City as a third party to that action.
The plaintiff was successful at trial, but the decision was overturned on appeal.
The plaintiff then commenced the present action directly against the defendant, alleging negligent misrepresentation.
The defendant applied to strike the action on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process.
Granting the application,
that the present cause of action is the same one litigated in the first action, simply under a different legal concept.
To allow the plaintiff to relitigate the same action on the same factual basis would be an abuse of process."

The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines.
The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal.
The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children.
He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside.
1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue.
Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of.
The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed.
2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home.
3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f).
The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).

Introduction [1] Two female employees of Cadillac Fairview Corporation Ltd., unionized employer, filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination in their employment contrary to The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code.[1] The Code prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee on the basis of sex.","Two female employees filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination contrary to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code.
The unionized employer applied for judicial review in the nature of prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s.25 of the Trade Union with the result that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint.
The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship and granted an order prohibiting the Board of Inquiry from hearing and determining the matter.
Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount.
HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code.
1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment.
2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy.
Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions.
To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect.
3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement.
The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account.
It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.
 4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff.
No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25]
This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary.
The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts.
This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals.
For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment.
The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31]
One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator.
The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction.
It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction.
The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement.
To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do."
181,"(2) In proceedings in respect of an offence referred to in subsection (1), no evidence shall be adduced by or on behalf of the accused that the complainant has engaged in sexual activity other than the sexual activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge, whether with the accused or with any other person, unless the judge...determines, in accordance with the procedures set out in sections 276.1 and 276.2, that the evidence (a) is of specific instances of sexual activity; (b) is relevant to an issue at trial; and (c) has significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice. (4) Where the judge, provincial court judge or justice is satisfied (a) that the application was made in accordance with subsection (2), (b) that copy of the application was given to the prosecutor and to the clerk of the court at least seven days previously, or such shorter interval as the judge, provincial court judge or justice may allow where the interests of justice so require, and (c) that the evidence sought to be adduced is capable of being admissible under subsection 276(2), the judge, provincial court judge or justice shall grant the application and hold hearing under section 276.2 to determine whether the evidence is admissible under subsection 276(2).","The appellant appeals his conviction of sexual assault causing bodily harm on the ground the trial judge erred in preventing cross-examination of the complainant.
The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault.
The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother.
The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter.
The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her.
The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment.
The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person.
The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence.
It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex.
The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault.
It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon.
That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred.
The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant in respect of the same assault is obvious.
That question has a direct bearing on her credibility."
182,"Based on the Guidelines and an annual income of $50,064.00, Mr. Holmes is required to pay basic monthly maintenance of $661.00 for two children and the provisional order will be varied to reflect this amount.","A provisional order from the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench required the respondent to pay monthly support based on his income of $55,000 for the couple's two children.
He was also required to pay half of the monthly dental expenses.
Subsequently, the respondent filed a financial statement showing his income to be $50,064.
HELD: The respondent's monthly child support payments are reduced according to the guidelines.
The respondent is also required to maintain health and dental insurance for his children through his employer.
The Court instructed the respondent on the procedure for submitting the children's health insurance claims.
The provisional order was confirmed subject to these specified variations."
183,"[2] Prior to hearing the merits of the application itself, counsel for the respondent, Nadine Onoushko, raised a preliminary objection with the court and argued that the matter should not proceed by way of judicial review but that the applicant should be restricted to an appeal of the decision of the Rentalsman in accordance with the provisions of s.","The applicant sought an Order quashing a decision of the Office of the Rentalsman pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664(1) and 674.
The respondent raised a preliminary objection, arguing that the matter should not proceed by way of judicial review but that the applicant should be restricted to an appeal of the Rentalsman's decision under s.49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, and that the applicant had failed to do so within the prescribed 30 day limit.
The applicant argued that she never received any notice of proceedings making it impossible for her to appeal within 30 days.
HELD: Preliminary objection dismissed.
The court ordered that the application be returned to the Chamber's list for a hearing on the merits.
Since there is nothing in the Act that allows the court to extend the time for filing an appeal, to deny the application for judicial review would deny the applicant an opportunity to pursue her only remedy in the circumstances."
184,"Justice Carver directed Mr. Saunders on January 14, 1999, to reimburse the estate with the money he had taken in September, 1997 and January, 1998. [26] In view of the actions of Mr. Saunders, and his professed ignorance respecting the personal uses to which he employed substantial part of the estate funds, Justice Carver was completely justified in ordering that his executor’s file be delivered to the court.","One of the residual legatees of the respondent estate filed a petition under s. 31(1) of the Probate Act.
At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.'
The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act.
The executor appealed.
He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security.
Dismissing the appeal,
that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding.
This was also one of those rare occasions where solicitor and client costs on the appeal were warranted, as the executor's actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which the Court termed reprehensible and unconscionable."
185,"Repairs [20] Although there was no specific contract with respect to the repair of the leased vehicles, it is clear that Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard with respect to some work orders that were issued by Redhead.","An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles.
At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993.
There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement.
It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them.
In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions.
HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs.
Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default.
Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act.
1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments.
Any verbal arrangement was never verified.
It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk.
2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.
The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.
 3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven.
Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.
 It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs.
Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number."
186,"(3d) 614; 1972 CanLII 1515 (BC SC), [1972] W.W.R. 450 (B.C.S.C.); Mr. Justice Berger, in dealing with defendant’s suggestion that crop damage may have been caused by other herds of cattle, said, in holding for the Plaintiff, that “there was simply no evidence of this”.","The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field.
The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD:
Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45.
The court valued the loss at $3,052.36.
It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production.
Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act.
A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle. 
This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence.
The issue here is the quantum of the damage.
The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case.
An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels.
The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions."

In determining the issues of: (1) whether Constable Schmidt, as an R.C.M.P. officer, had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer appointed pursuant to The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act in the City of Prince Albert?","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1).
The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached.
In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop.
HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08.
A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary.
1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada.
When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated.
The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another.
Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation.
The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers.
2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles.
The R. v. Emke decision is outdated.
3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty.
There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter."
188,"[2] The applicant proposed to the respondent that it repay the judgment recovered by the latter as follows: Beginning balance, as per judgment: 122,601.36 October interest 520.64 123,122.00 Awarded costs 7,572.50 Balance October 31, 2000 130,694.50 November 1, 2000 payment 32,894.50 97,800.00 November interest 401.92 December interest 415.32 Balance December 31, 2000 98,617.23 January 1, 2001 payment 33,117.23 65,500.00 January interest 278.15 February interest 251.23 Balance February 28, 2001 66,029.38 March 1, 2001 payment 33,529.38 32,500.00 March interest 138.01 April interest 133.56 Balance April 30, 2001 32,771.58 May 1, 2001 payment 32,771.58 Balance May 1, 2001 0.00 [3] The respondent objects strenuously pointing out that the applicant had plenty of opportunity over the years to pay its obligation and also drawing attention to number of allegations made in Mr. Tait’s affidavits and elsewhere suggesting that the officers of the applicant mismanaged the affairs of the company or re-directed funds which should have been allocated to payment of the interest which is the subject matter of the judgment finally granted.","FIAT. The numbered company applied for relief pursuant to the Queen's Bench Act s.81(1) allowing the court to direct the judgment to be paid by installments.
The creditor objected that the applicant had plenty of opportunity over the years to pay and drew attention to prior allegations of mismanagement or redirection of funds which should have been allocated to the payment of interest.
HELD: The payment which should have been paid in November was to be paid within 7 days.
The remaining payments set out in the schedule will commence January 2001 with the change in rate of interest from that provided under the Interest Act to one equivalent to pre-judgment interest.
A 5 day grace period was allowed after which the respondent was allowed to proceed immediately with enforcement by execution, garnishment or any means it deems appropriate.
The taxed cost of this application was added to the judgment and will be part of the balance to be paid on May 1, 2001.
Counsel could apply for further directions."
189,"She takes the position that despite the significant reduction in the applicant’s income, he is still in financial position to continue to meet spousal support obligations.","The applicant sought to vary the 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing spousal support of $2,500 per month.
The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP.
Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed.
HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.
 1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts.
The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.
 2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension.
3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions.
However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired.
The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home.
She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property.
The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge).
There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs."
190,"41 and 42 of the TUA do not apply, because the order of the Chief of Police predated the collective agreement, or there is conflict between the Police Act and another Act or the collective agreement, or the statutory freeze contained in the TUA, does not preclude the plaintiff pursuing any common law rights in the courts, or that the dispute in its essential character does not arise out of the collective agreement but rather pursuant to the Regulations under the Police Act, or that the exclusivity of the bargaining agent provisions in the TUA are not applicable because the plaintiffs’ rights as police officers under the Police Act are individual as opposed to collective rights, these are matters that involve the threshold question of whether the question is itself arbitrable.","The plaintiffs were Sergeants in the Town of Bedford Police Department.
Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank.
The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement.
After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights.
The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter.
Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed.
Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court.
It is irrelevant if the plaintiffs have now lost their rights to initiate the arbitration process."
191,"The decision was appealed by Mrs. Collins and on April 13, 2000 the Court of Appeal delivered the following judgment: The trial judge's reasons for judgment state that as long as the parties reside in the trailer court, the parties are to share joint custody. Therefore the parties may proceed by way of an application to vary and the issue raised by the decision of the Court of Appeal will be subsumed in that application.","The Court of Appeal remitted the issue of custody to the trial judge on April 13, 2000 but the matter was adjourned for various reasons.
The parties had brought numerous applications since the July 9, 1999 decision and they had been in a pre-trial.
HELD: An application was to be brought which would encompass all of the new issues.
There had been numerous changes in circumstances which went beyond the single issue referred back.
The petitioner intends to challenge the legislation dealing with custody and access but was unaware he is required to serve notice under the Constitutional Questions Act."
192,326 of the Act; There was no evidence to justify the learned Provincial Court judge\'s finding that returns were not filed; That there was unreasonable delay which compromised the appellants\' right to a fair trial; That the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by some person authorized to sign on the Minister\'s behalf.,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act.
Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant.
The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection.
Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel.
There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing.
The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances.
2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party.
This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code.
Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed.
It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns.
3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326.
The appellants filed blank returns.
The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.
 It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all.
4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b).
Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage.
The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced.
Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.
 5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister.
Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing.
Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties.
The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation.
It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.
 The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.
 It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal.
The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act.
The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant."
193,"On April 4, 2001 the young person appeared before the Youth Court judge and requested that the Court appoint him counsel after his Legal Aid lawyer withdrew. v. B.W., [1997] B.C.J. No. 3056 (Q.L.) (B.C. Youth Courts), the young person refused to be represented by legal aid counsel and applied for court appointed counsel of his own choice.","An application for certiorari and mandamus.
In issue is whether the Youth Court judge has the discretion to refuse to appoint counsel to represent a young person having regard to the provisions of s.11(4) of the Young Offenders Act.
The meaning of the word 'unable' in s.11(4)(b) was in issue.
The youth was facing a variety of charges including failure to comply with conditions of an undertaking; failure to attend court; possession of property obtained by crime; obstructing a police officer.
He requested the Youth Court appoint counsel after his Legal Aid lawyer withdrew.
Both parents were on social assistance.
The matter was adjourned to investigate the possibility of an aunt providing financial assistance but the youth advised in April that she was unable to do so.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
The Youth Court judge did not err in refusing to direct counsel be appointed.
The Youth Court judge's discretion is not limited solely to considerations of financial inability.
The youth disentitled himself to continued Legal Aid representation by his own misconduct."
194,"[3] The goods in issue were books supplied to ITI as course materials. [4] The judge held that once ITI had decided what course materials it would use, there was binding contract to supply those very materials to the students.","A supplier delivered computer books to an educational institution prior to the appointment of a receiver for the institution.
Immediately after the appointment of the receiver, the supplier presented a written demand for repossession of the books.
The receiver refused, claiming that the books were subject to an agreement for sale to the institution's students and therefore, exempt. 
A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed.
Appeal allowed; return of books or payment of their value to the supplier ordered.
Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time.
The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand.
The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials.
Thus, the books were not subject to any agreement for resale within the meaning of the Act."
195,"She dismissed the application, noting first that she had not read the criminal record, and secondly that trial judges often are necessarily made aware of evidence that is both incriminating and inadmissible and are nevertheless required to continue with the proceedings on the basis that the inadmissible evidence cannot be taken into account in reaching verdict.","The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure.
In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit.
The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her.
The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial.
There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused.
The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point.
The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible.
She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself."
196,He found that the Board did not err in adding the company HRK Collections Fine Art Limited as a party and did not exceed its jurisdiction in finding that the appellant had not complied with its original order.,"A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users.
A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant.
The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence.
The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada.
The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision.
During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations.
In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench.
This was not appealed.
An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order.
The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V.
The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services).
The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal.
The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order.
It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance.
The original order cannot be challenged at this late date."
197,"[7] After the separation took place the petitioner returned to her Melville residence which the parties agree has value of $30,000.00 both at the time of the marriage and the time of the application.","The wife sought an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property.
They married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in 1997.
Each had significant assets at the time of the marriage, which had increased in value.
They agreed at the time of the marriage to keep their assets separate and to not make a claim on the assets of the other and that their entire estates would be left to their respective children.
 The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths.
HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000.
1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention.
This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act.
The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death.
2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a).
There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home.
The Melville residence owned by the wife at the time of the marriage was exempt in accordance with their agreement.
It had not increased in value and the wife solely paid its maintenance. 3)No costs."
198,"If passage of time limit which is milestone toward the trial caused the Court to lose jurisdiction to determine the child's best interest this would contradict the object of the Act."" From that passage, the Court of Appeal is again underlining that as the trial date approached, time limits need to be extended in order to meet the object of the Act when the best interest requires it and when the proceeding is moving toward hearing which is designed to decide the overall best interests of the child and therefore the type of disposition order that should best protect the child's interests.","The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction.
No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties.
The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel.
Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed.
The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial.
When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act.
When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date."
199,"(a) General damages based upon expected profits from development of the property and/or excavation of sand; [7] While maintaining that the details of the damages sought are not sufficiently particularized in the statement of claim, the appellants have not suggested that the pleading is so deficient as to warrant striking under Civil Procedure Rule 14.25.","The plaintiff company sued the defendants for negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract alleging that the defendants sold it a piece of land smaller than what it was represented to be.
The plaintiff intended to excavate and sell sand from the land and claimed damages including loss of profits due to the smaller amount of sand available.
Before filing a defence the appellants demanded particulars of the alleged lost profits.
The plaintiff refused to provide particulars and the chambers judge dismissed the appellants' application for an order compelling particulars.
,appeal dismissed;
the appellants had not challenged the sufficiency of the pleadings; no case was made out that the appellants required the particulars in order to file a proper defence to the action. 
There were other rules available to the appellants which could be utilized to discover the underlying details of the damage claim."
200,It is misconception to think that by proceeding with vendor’s and purchaser’s application that the closing date of the transaction will be automatically put over until the application is heard. Those cases are not authority that an application must be commenced and heard before the date of closing.,"The vendor's application for an order declaring that the purchaser's objection was without merit was commenced 13 days after the closing date.
Application dismissed;
although such an application does not have to be heard prior to the closing date, it does have to be commenced prior to that date."
201,"The Defence Evidence [7] The accused testified that he suffers from panic attacks and that, when stopped by the police, he was in the grip of such an attack. [18] Although the accused testified that he was into his panic attack his evidence was that he was working hard, stressed out about his marriage, stressed out about his mother and sister, off his medications, drinking, and not sleeping.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drug (Code ss.253(a) and 255(1)).
The accused admitted to consuming one vodka cooler before driving but argued the signs of impairment were manifestations of his panic attack.
No .08 charge was laid, as his readings were .07 and .06.
HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving.
The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack.
The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.
As stated in McCallum, the fact that the effects of alcohol may have been exacerbated by the accused suffering from fatigue does not provide a defence to the charge."
202,"That the Workers’ Compensation Board of Saskatchewan acted outside of the jurisdiction prescribed to it in The Workers’ Compensation Act, 1979, R.S.S. W-17.1, when it denied the Applicants’ claim for compensation, based upon its finding that Mr. Truitt’s death was not compensable, because he was not found dead within the meaning of section 30 of The Workers’ Compensation Act, 1979.","The deceased was a master's student who also worked as a student assistant at the University of Saskatchewan.
He became ill while teaching a class.
His students helped him to the faculty lounge.
He was found in the faculty washroom unconscious and not breathing approximately 30 minutes later.
Emergency medical technicians were not able to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead at the Royal University Hospital.
An application for dependants' benefits was submitted over 3 years later.
The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim.
The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674.
HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979.
The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption.
2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant.
3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing.
4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis."
203,"[4] At the appeal hearing Mr. Maley took the position that the notice he received of the cleaning claim as set out on the hearing notice was inadequate and, that when he attended for the hearing before the Rentalsman he was not prepared to refute the amount of the cleaning claim.","FIAT. After the tenant vacated the home, the landlord, pursuant to Residential Tenancies Act s.47, sought $3,746.76 for rent loss, cleaning, damage to the premises and unpaid utilities.
The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01.
The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence.
The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process.
While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting.
The Rentalsman's decision, made after reviewing pictures, repair bills and the statements of house cleaners, who indicated the hours worked and their hourly rate, was not patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the evidence."
204,"(Danka) seeks interlocutory injunctive relief framed in argument as follows: i) An interlocutory injunction until trial of this action restraining the Defendants, Ritchie Gifford, Clifford Kohuch, Kenneth Speed and Allan Currie from breaching the terms of their respective restrictive covenants in favour of Danka by taking employment with Brennan Educational Supply Ltd. in any position that involves the sales or service of photocopiers, printers, facsimile machines or related multi-function machines; ii) An interlocutory injunction restraining the Defendant Employees from competing, directly or indirectly, with Danka Canada Inc. until after their respective contracts of employment with Danka Canada Inc. have been terminated by the giving and expiry of reasonable period of notice to quit; iii) An interlocutory injunction until trial of this action restraining the Defendant Employees or any individual who were employees of Danka Canada Inc. and who are hired by Brennan Office Plus or Brennan Educational Supply Ltd. after the date of this Court’s order from soliciting, directly or indirectly, the customers of Danka Canada Inc. and from performing any service work to equipment that was sold or leased by Danka Canada Inc.; iv) An interlocutory injunction until trial of this action restraining the Defendants, Garry Huntington, Robert Brennan and Brennan Educational Supply Ltd., from soliciting, directly or indirectly, the employees of Danka Canada Inc., from soliciting, directly or indirectly the customers of Danka Canada Inc. in respect of the sale or lease of photocopiers, printers, facsimile machines or related multi-function machines and from performing any service work for customers of Danka Canada Inc. in respect of any machines that were sold or leased to the user by Danka Canada Inc.","The plaintiff employer sought injunctive relief and sought to enforce certain restrictive covenants and to restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any dealings with customers of the plaintiff or pertaining to equipment sold or leased to customers by the plaintiff.
HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow.
These are those reasons. 1)
The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines.
The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business.
2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired.
The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff.
The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients.
3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice.
The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice.
4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants.
The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods.
5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff."
205,[10] The Court now turns its attention to the more substantive basis upon which Mr. Tilk opposes court approval of the applicant’s Proposal namely; that members of the employee pension plan who have been classified unsecured creditors (by virtue of the Company’s indebtedness for the unfunded portion of their pension plans) should be reclassified in some other category of creditor.,"The company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by its creditor pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.
A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide.
He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status.
HELD: The Proposal was accepted.
 1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA.
The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims.
Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal.
2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court.
The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation.
Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.
 3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing."

[1] The appellant wife appeals the decision of the chambers judge varying the amount of child support and reducing the amount of arrears.
She contends that the chambers judge erred in varying the order for maintenance and reducing the amount of arrears in the absence of evidence that there was a change in the conditions, means and needs of the respondent or the children as contemplated by s. 17(4) of the Divorce Act.[FOOTNOTE 1][2]
The respondent contends that the amount of child support should be reduced by reason of his reduced income caused by his unemployment or reduced employment over the last four years.
The appellant argues that the respondent has failed to satisfactorily explain his unemployment.
There is evidence that his change in income is due to his own voluntary action and, as a result, he has failed to establish the threshold 'change in circumstances' which could result in a variation of the order.
[3] The appeal is allowed and the decision of the chambers judge is set aside.
There is evidence from which this Court can impute income to the respondent in the amount of $27,000, and the child support shall be varied to $510.00 per month as of February 1, 2004 in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines.
The sum of $1,926.78 currently held by the Maintenance Enforcement Office shall be applied to the arrears.
The respondent shall pay the sum of $200.00 per month on the arrears commencing April 1, 2004.
[4] The appellant shall have her costs in the usual way.1R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd. Supp.)."
207,"(1) Mr. Pilat, having income imputed to him in the sum of $40,000.00, shall pay child support to Ms. Lilley, pursuant to s.","FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter.
He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated.
HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest.
In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination.
Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment.
He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000.
The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year.
It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances.
The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable.
2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter.
3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income.
4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted.
The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.
 In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.
 5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith.
The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful.
Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax.
It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order.
The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure.
Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure."
208,"Mr. Dorosh seeks to vary the child support order and asks that the court order that he pay zero (0) child support on the basis that he has his daughter in his custody at least 40% of the time and on the basis that his income has changed. Commencing September 1, 2004, Mr. Dorosh will pay to Ms. Antonowitsch the sum of $202.00 on the first day of each and every month for so long as Letitia is child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. This order, being made subsequent to May 1, 1997, falls under the provisions of the Guidelines and amended provisions of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.","FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support.
HELD: 1)
On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody.
The child is now 15 years old.
The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting.
The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests.
The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.
 2) The access was varied in January 2004.
Nothing has changed to warrant a variation.
3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time.
There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears.
The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date.
In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund.
If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4)
The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working.
The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control.
The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use.
The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review.
The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs."
209,"[3] The second count is number three in the indictment, that the accused:  on or about the 12th day October, A.D. 2004 at or near Aldersville in the County of Lunenburg, Province of Nova Scotia, did break and enter the dwelling house of James Eustace and did commit therein an indictable offence contrary to Section 348(1)(d) of the Criminal Code.","The 23 year old defendant pled guilty to two counts of breaking and entering a dwelling house and one count of breaking and entering a shed.
He cooperated with the police and provided evidence against his co-accused.
He had a previous criminal record, which included convictions for mischief, theft, break and enter, breach of an undertaking and possession of stolen goods.
Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment;
in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused."

No. 014242 of 1992, J.C. of Regina Appeal File: 1451 Quorum: The Honourable Mr. Justice Vancise The Honourable Mr. Justice Lane The Honourable Madam Justice Jackson THE COURT: Having regard for the governing standard of appellate review, found in such cases as Pelech v.","Appeal from [1993]TWL QB93106 QB93p55.
HELD: There was no tenable basis for interfering with the trial judge's decision to award custody to the father.
An award of $700.00 a month spousal support was not unreasonable having regard for (i) the length of the relationship (approximately fifteen years), (ii) the husband's wage (approximately $55,000.00 per year) and (iii) the fact that the wife had seldom worked outside the home."
211,"APPELLANT'S POSITION The appellant contends the respondents failed in their contractual duty (which the appellant classifies as fiduciary duty) to teach the appellant both how to properly care for the child and how to properly provide for his needs, and having failed to meet their obligations the respondents do not have ""sufficient interest"" as required by s.6(1) of The Children's Law Act, S.S. 1990-91, c.C-8.1 and are therefore without status to make an application for custody.","The Respondents contracted with the Department to care for a child and his Mother who was mentally disabled.
After two years, the relationship between the Respondents and the Mother broke down and she left their home.
The Respondents sought and were granted custody of the child.
The Mother appealed.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
1)The Respondents had sufficient interest under s.6 of The Children's Law Act to seek custody of the child.
2)The trial judge correctly determined that the only issue was the child's best interests, even in a contest between a parent and a stranger, although the parent/child relationship was one factor to be considered.
3)The findings of the trial judge were strongly supported by the evidence, the law was correctly applied, and therefore his decision ought not be overturned.
4)The matter was returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access."
212,"Justice Gruchy, in an oral decision on June 30, 1993, following an interim custody hearing, ordered joint custody of the children, with maximum exposure to each parent through, among other provisions, regular alternating weekend contact by the father from Friday evening until Sunday and during the week, while the children engage in their regular activities, on two consecutive overnights from Tuesday after school until Thursday, when they are to be picked up by their mother.","This was a petition for divorce with an application for settlement of corollary matters, especially custody and access.
The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions.
The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue.
The mother sought sole custody with generous access.
The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication.
Allowing the mother's application,
that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say.
Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues.
As the parties lacked flexibility, a detailed access plan was incorporated."
213,"Banilevic for the appellant, Paul Flengeris David Burke on his own behalf DISPOSITION: Appeal Heard: October 1994 Appeal Dismissed: 3 October 1994 (orally) Written Reasons: October 1994 Appeal Files: 6289 6290 Appeal From: Provincial Court Reasons by: The Honourable Chief Justice Bayda In concurrence: The Honourable Madam Justice Gerwing and The Honourable Madam Justice Jackson BAYDA C.J.S.: The ultimate question in this appeal is whether the evidence adduced by the Crown - the defence called no evidence - was insufficient to such a degree that the trial judge\'s verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Court either unreasonable or one that cannot be supported by the evidence and, on the basis of the Yebes v. The appellants alleged two insufficiencies in the evidence: (i)""The absence of any expert evidence that the injuries sustained by Musam Musleh [the victim-complainant] resulted from any blows such as kicks or punches and as such were the result of an assault."" In short, they contended that the Crown failed to prove that an offence of assault, or indeed an offence of any kind, had been committed.","At trial in Provincial Court, the accuseds called no evidence and were convicted.
They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance.
2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds.
3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code."
214,"Section 100(1) of the Criminal Code, the material portions of which read as follows, provides that: 100.(1) Where an offender is convicted of an indictable offence in the commission of which violence against person is used, and for which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for ten years or more ., the court that sentences the offender shall, ., in addition to any other punishment that may be imposed for that offence, make an order prohibiting the offender from possessing any firearm or any ammunition or explosive substance for (a)in the case of first conviction for such an offence, ten years, and (b).","The Crown elected to proceed summarily and the accused entered a plea of guilty to a charge of assault under S.266 of the Code.
He was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment, 18 months probation and a 10 year fire arm prohibition was imposed.
He appealed his sentence.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
1)Because the accused had no related record and given the circumstances of the assault,
the sentence of imprisonment was reduced to time already served (15 days).
2)The trial judge erred in imposing the 10 year fire arm prohibition under S.100 of the Code. S.100 requires a conviction on an indictable offence involving violence against a person where the maximum sentence available is 10 years imprisonment or more.
3)The maximum sentence for assault under S.266 is 5 years if the Crown proceeds by indictment and 6 months if, as here, the Crown proceeds summarily."

After the husband's retirement, the wife sought to receive her share of the pension from the employer as a lump sum.
The husband objected, claiming that he was entitled to any remaining benefit from her share in the event she should predecease him.

217,"The appellant's main contention arises out of what the trial judge said at the conclusion of arguments by counsel: After hearing the evidence that came to the Court, that the Crown evidence is credible and do not find the Accused's evidence credible. His contention, as I understand it to be, is that the trial judge so concerned himself with the question of the credibility of the evidence of the complainant and the accused that he overlooked his duty to consider such evidence, ""together with the rest of the evidence, with a view to determining whether it raised a reasonable doubt of the appellant\'s guilt, irrespective of whether he believed the evidence of the (complainant)"": per Sherstobitoff, J.A. in R.","The accused was convicted of assault.
He contends that the trial judge so concerned himself with the question of credibility of the complainant and the accused that he overlooked his duty to consider evidence of a witness, 'together with the rest of the evidence, with a view to determining whether it raised a reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt, irrespective of whether he believed the evidence of the complainant.'
HELD: Appeal dismissed and conviction accordingly affirmed.
 1)Great deference to findings of credibility made at trial should be shown.
2)The trial judge did not say that he found the accused guilty only upon the credibility of the complainant and the accused.
He said that he found the Crown's evidence to be credible, and the accused's evidence not to be credible.
The Crown's evidence was comprised of both the complainant and the witness.
3)The trial judge's findings are supported by the evidence and his conclusions are not clearly wrong so as to make the conviction unreasonable."
218,"Doctor Jackson was referred to the summary of the review team report, dated February 23rd, 1996, prepared by Ms. MacIsaac and the administrative group, and expressed his concurrence with the concluding paragraph that reads: ""The report of Drs. Kutcher and Kusumakar cannot be released in its entirety because it was prepared for the purpose of internal evaluation, education and improvement of Hospital care and practices, and contains confidential patient information."" Doctor Jackson testified he was surprised when he learned the Regional Hospital had agreed to release the report, adding his belief the hospital did not understand the ""issue of confidentiality"".","Following three patient suicides at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital, the hospital, in response to concerns and questions from family members, retained two psychiatrists to review the cases, the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the cases, patient records and hospital policies and practices.
At the end of the review they were to provide a written report to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer.
The hospital staff participating in the investigation and review were advised that their information would be treated as part of a 'peer review' and therefore confidential.
Upon receipt of the report the hospital, as a result, refused to disclose the report to the families.
An application pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was made by an M.L.A., who sought for the disclosure of the report and for a review of the hospital's decision to not release the report.
The hospital decided to release the full report.
The appellant employees appealed the decision of the hospital, claiming that they had been assured confidentiality.
Allowing the appeal,
that the disclosure of personal information consisting of personal recommendations or evaluations, character references, or personal evaluations by the appellants and other hospital staff are presumed under s. 20(3)(g) of the Act to be an unreasonable invasion of a third party's personal privacy.
Under s. 20(1) the hospital is required to refuse to disclose this information.
It necessarily follows that recommendations in the report founded upon such information is also presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy and is likewise not to be disclosed.
The remainder of the report is disclose able."
219,"February 16, 1996 The applicant seeks to have the firm, Robertson Stromberg, barred from acting for the plaintiff by reason of Ms. Schirr, a member of that firm, having been active in representing the defendant, a Crown corporation, during the years prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change of government in Saskatchewan.","The applicant sought to have the law firm barred from acting for the plaintiff because a member of that firm had been active in representing the defendant prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change in government.
This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors.
The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause.
1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff.
This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.
 2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern.
4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme.
It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists.
Also such policies may well have changed since 1992."
220,"Thus, the documentation stands as tangible personal property and is subject to tax as such by virtue of Subsection 5(9) of the Act unless the Appellant can claim an exemption under Section 8(1)(f) of the Act. The respondent argues the Board erred in its conclusion that the purchase of the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use in Saskatchewan.","The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax.
Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges.
The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications.
The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately.
The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f).
The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act.
At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax.
HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed.
Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature.
The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact.
2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.
 3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact.
There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement.
The words used are simple and ordinary.
It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience.
To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax.
The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.
 5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board."
221,"In number of cases where the method adopted by the police officer of creating the copy has been the subject of questioning and has been found to be deficient, courts have refused to admit the certificate of analyses. The law is clear that the affidavit is to be received as evidence unless the officer is challenged in that respect and it emerges that there was some deficiency in the preparation of the copy which would negate the evidence of its being true copy.","The accused was acquitted on a charge of operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drugs and while his blood alcohol level exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood when questions were raised as to the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to the copy of the certificate of analysis.
HELD: 1)Section 258(7) has been judicially amended to mean 'true copy' which presumably, though not logically, means something more than 'copy'.
It has grown to the point that an affidavit may be disregarded if the police do not provide supplemental evidence when challenged as to the manner in which they assured the accuracy of the copy.
2)The trial judge further advanced the law to a point where, even when not challenged, there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit.
This is an error of law.
A challenge under s258(7) should be based upon a discovered difference as between the copy and the original.
Otherwise the refusal to admit the certificate becomes merely a prize in a procedural game which can only bring the justice system into disrepute.
3)A new trial was ordered to determine whether the stop was justified."
222,"Section 718.2 (a) (iii) provides: court that imposes sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles: (a) sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (iii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused position of trust or authority in relation to the victim...","The offender, a former police chief, plead guilty to five theft related charges.
The amount of money involved for all five counts was $64,000.
He used his position of authority as police chief to commit the crimes.
The offender did not have a criminal record.
The offences were premeditated, and directed against trusting and well-intentioned organizations.
Sentencing the offender to four months consecutive imprisonment on each count, for a total of twenty months, and ordering restitution to the victims,
 that the sentence must serve as a message of deterrence to all individuals who hold positions of trust and authority.
This message is particularly important to police officers, whose integrity must be beyond reproach."
223,"The grounds relied on by Cajon give rise to the following issues: (1) Did the adjudicator err in law by finding that the respondent Kovach by her conduct had not frustrated or fundamentally breached her employment contract? In my view, the adjudicator acted well within his jurisdiction when determining what the terms of Ms. Kovach\'s employment contract were and that Cajon had not fulfilled obligations thereunder.","The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act.
The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination.
The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work.
The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked.
The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges.
She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.
1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended.
The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.
 2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one.
The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law.
The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them.
4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations."

A period of probation was appropriate but 3 years was out of proportion to the nature of the offence.
The inclusion of a term prohibiting him from consuming alcohol was inappropriate since it had no relation to the purpose of the original recognizance."
225,"Considering and weighing the evidence of the description of the robber given by Mr. Hanson and his girlfriend to the police at the time, the evidence related in court by each of those witnesses, the photograph of the accused identified by Mr. Hanson in the photo ID line-up, the photograph of the accused tendered as defence evidence, and the appearance of the accused in court (no mustache), have no reasonable doubt that Mr. Hanson identified the accused as being the robber. do not find Mr. Hanson's failure to identify the accused at the preliminary inquiry (eight months after the robbery) nor at trial (eleven months after the robbery) to be reason to suspect or reject his evidence that he identified the accused in the photo ID line-up three and one-half months after the robbery and gave an accurate description to the police immediately at the time of the robbery.","The accused is on trial for armed robbery and the central issue is identity.
The Court admitted a letter into evidence in which the accused attempts to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi for him.
HELD: Accused found guilty.
The accused was correctly identified.
The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by.
The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry.
The letter is direct evidence of where the accused was not at the time of the robbery and is corroboration for the identification evidence of the Crown witness."
226,"B. The Board of Directors of the White Bear Education Complex Inc. proposes to proceed as follows with respect to the following employees: (b) With respect to Rodney Dignean that he be suspended, without pay, for ten day period, effective January 29, 1997, during which time full investigation of his conduct in his position of Coordinator of Post Secondary Programs be completed. very brief written report by one Reggie Blacksmith, in which he describes himself as “Consultant for the White Bear Education Complex Inc. Board,” concludes that: Rodney Dignean must be terminated from the position as “Post-Secondary Co-ordinator.” For he has disgraced his responsible position, and lost the trust of his employer, White Bear First Nations Chief and Council and White Bear Education Complex Inc. This conclusion appears to be based upon little more than an examination of Dignean’s December 13, 1996, letter to the band council solicitor.","The plaintiff was the coordinator of post-secondary education programs for White Bear First Nation, between 1990 until his termination in May 1997.
The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff.
In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs.
There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict.
The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct.
The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment.
The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal.
The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause.
HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed.
The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct.
There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance.
The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract.
Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed.
Although the plaintiff had been treated unfairly, the plaintiff had not shown that the employer was guilty of harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious conduct."
227,"Subsection 247(3) provides as follows: (3) The refusal by development officer to (b) approve tentative or final plan of subdivision, may be appealed by the Applicant to the Board. Section 250(3) provides: (3) An Applicant may only appeal refusal to approve concept plan or tentative or final plan of subdivision on the grounds that the decision of the development officer does not comply with the subdivision by-law.","The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval.
In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications.
The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus.
Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan).
The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness.
The development officer misinterpreted the legislation.
Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval.
There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate.
The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete.
Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy"
228,"Mrs. Clarke will probably have yet further indebtedness to Revenue Canada for 1998 because Mr. Clarke had at that time the Interim Order which pre-dated May the 1st, 1997 and therefore, the Child Support Guidelines Income Tax change probably did not take place until May the 13th, 1998 when the parties altered the level of child support.","The parties were married for 14 years and separated in 1995, entering into a detailed Separation Agreement in 1998.
The two children of the marriage are 16 and 8 years of age.
There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment.
The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training.
For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00
The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since.
The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00.
The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment.
This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties.
The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose.
Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001.
An adjustment was also made to account for arrears in child support and child support payments."
229,"[4] Civil Procedure Rule 33.01(A)(1) reads as follows: Notwithstanding the provisions of rule 33.01, the court may order the defendant to make an interim payment of such amount as it thinks just, not exceeding reasonable proportion of the damages which in the opinion of the court are likely to be recovered by the plaintiff after taking into account any relevant contributory negligence and any set off, cross-claim or counter-claim on which the defendant may be entitled to rely, if the court is satisfied: (a) that the defendant against whom the order is sought has admitted liability for the plaintiff’s damages, or (b) the plaintiff has obtained judgment against the defendant for damages to be assessed.","In a trial of liability only, jury found defendants to be entirely responsible for causing motor vehicle accident.
Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff.
Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages.
Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied.
Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount.
The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced.
There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment.
Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition.
In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered.
Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application.
The evidence in support of the spouse's application was far too incomplete and had yet to be tested by defendants in discovery.
Court could not form opinion on what damages spouse was likely to recover."
230,"MSI states that Hurd should have returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, Hurd’s condition pre-existed purchase of the insurance policy and was not covered thereby.","The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from MSI for the time he expected to reside in the USA pursuing studies.
The policy did not cover the periods he would be in Saskatchewan where he ordinarily resided with his parents.
The plaintiff suffered chest pain following a water-skiing accident in August 1997 in Saskatchewan and underwent a thoracostomy for a collapsed lung while in Saskatchewan.
He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA.
MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy.
The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary.
They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb.
HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $26,864.46 plus costs, to be taxed.
1)The evidence that travel was dangerous and put the plaintiff's life in jeopardy was accepted.
Therefore the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for the surgery.
2)The exclusionary clause did not exempt MSI from liability for payment.
The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation under the policy to extend the benefits in question.
The policy was in effect from August 1, 1997 to July 31, 1998.
It was not raised in a letter confirming the dates of his coverage sent after the plaintiff had experienced the pneumothorax of which MSI had been informed."
231,"The appellants apply for leave and, if granted, appeal the judge’s decision to order restitution of the full amount rather than one-half of the amount as submitted in the joint recommendation.","The appellants pled guilty to theft over $5,000.
The Crown and the defence put forward a joint sentencing recommendation of two years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud, which was all that the appellants had actually retained.
The sentencing judge ordered full restitution.
The appellants appealed; the Crown conceded that the appeal should be allowed.
Allowing the appeal,
that while the agreement reached by the Crown and the appellants was not binding upon the sentencing judge, the joint recommendation was a fit sentence; in the circumstances there was no sound reason for departing from it."
232,"(orally) [1] The proposed appellants applied to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal of a Court of Queen’s Bench trial judge’s order awarding costs to the proposed respondent payable by Spelliscy and Tapp, jointly and personally.","The proposed appellants applied to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal of an order awarding costs payable jointly and personally by Tapp and Spelliscy on the basis the award was punitive and inordinately high.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs on double Column V.
The Court is still of the view the proposed appellants would have little chance of success on appeal.
Costs are a discretionary award and there was material on file upon which the trial judge could base his decision.
The appellants failed to first apply to the trial judge to obtain leave to appeal as required by Queen's Bench Act s.38."
233,[4] The Queen’s Bench file indicates that the application was served by mail addressed to his home address an address which he designated as his address for service upon electing to represent himself.[1] [5] Whether the appellant was validly served under the Queen’s Bench Rules is an issue that will have to be properly presented and determined by the division of the Court hearing the appeal.,"The appellant sought an order under Rule 15 staying execution and garnishment proceedings with respect to an order granted in January 2003 for child support and s.7 expenses and costs.
He questioned the validity of service by mail arguing personal service was required.
HELD: Whether the appellant was validly served is an issue that will properly presented to and determined by the Court hearing the appeal.
Bringing an application under Queen's Bench Rule 271 would have been a more expeditious procedure.
The stay was granted since this was the type of appeal that can be expedited.
The monies paid into court will remain in Court pending the hearing and determination of the appeal.
Costs were reserved to the Court hearing the appeal."
234,[3] There is presumption of testamentary capacity and in the face of challenge the executors have provided uncontradicted evidence which affirms positively the testimony capacity of Mr. Carlson not only at the crucial time the will was signed but for some months thereafter.,"The applicants brought a motion seeking proof of the Will in solemn form, questioning the testamentary capacity, due execution of the will and raising the issue of undue influence and coercion.
HELD: The motion was dismissed with costs.
The role of the Court is that of a gatekeeper.
The Court will not send an issue to trial unless evidence is brought forth which, if accepted, would tend to negative knowledge and approval of testamentary capacity.
No issue of credibility arose."
235,"“I told her not to do this because she would ruin the dog.” [13] The first night she came he slept in the same bed as her but only this one time because her mother called and said, “Don’t sleep with her.” [14] The Respondent does admit that the Complainant would grab his crotch on occasion but “I told her this had to stop.” [15] There is evidence that on July 29, 2002, the Respondent was severely beaten by home invader.","The Agency brought an application for a finding that the Respondent had abused a child, for the purposes of entering his name in the Child Abuse Register.
The complainant described certain incidents that amounted to sexual assault when she was under the age of 16.
The Respondent had previously been acquitted of charges based on the same allegations in criminal court.
The Respondent has abused a child within the meaning of the Act.
Although the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities, it is elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and their implications.
However, it is considerably less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt."
236,"Westridge represented to Genex, expressly or by implication, that: (a) it had carefully examined all of the tender documents, including the tendering and contract requirements, the formal agreement, the general conditions of the contract, the general requirements, specifications, drawings and addenda; (b) it had the qualifications, expertise and ability to furnish all material, plans and labour necessary for the proper completion of the entire work as described in the tender and contract documents; (c) it had the qualifications and expertise to recommend the use of alternative products and construction methods; (d) the use of alternative products and construction methods, would not compromise the performance or longevity of the Tullymet Nucleus Unit unless expressly identified, and in particular that the use of the Galvalume alternate, would not compromise the performance or longevity of the building, or the building’s roof; (e) it could and would bring to bear due and proper expertise, skill, care and diligence in respect of all aspects of the construction of the Tullymet Nucleus Unit undertaken by it; and (f) if retained by Genex, it could and would carry out all aspects of the work in respect of the construction of the Tullymet Nucleus Unit with the result that the Tullymet Nucleus Unit would be fit and sufficient for the purpose for which it was intended and be of good material, design and workmanship and free of defects and be of reasonable durability having regard to similar structures built for similar purposes.","The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant.
The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn.
The applicant was the general contractor.
Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant.
The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend.
If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered.
The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.
 1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship.
They are not performance bonds.
2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship.
3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident.
What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence.
Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend."
237,"[E.H.] acknowledge there have been no agreements or court orders with regard to [K.V.P.A.]’s support nor has Mr. [V.G.B.] requests this Court to set child support at rate higher than the Table amount based on undue hardship. [E.H.] has no ability to pay substantial arrears if child support order was made retroactive and any such order would clearly impair his ability to provide ongoing support, not just for [K.V.P.A.], but for his other children as well.","This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support.
HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child.
The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support.
He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income.
1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment.
There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.
 2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'.
That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines.
The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning.
The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a).
The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income."
238,"The Code, CDSA and Search Warrants [18] Section 487(1)and (2) of the Code provide as follows: 487(1) justice who is satisfied by information on oath in Form that there are reasonable grounds to believe that there is in building, receptacle or place (a) anything on or in respect of which any offence against this Act or any other Act of Parliament has been or is suspected to have been committed, (b) anything that there are reasonable grounds to believe will afford evidence with respect to the commission of an offence, or will reveal the whereabouts of person who is believed to have committed an offence, against this Act or any other Act of Parliament, (c) anything that there are reasonable grounds to believe is intended to be used for the purpose of committing any offence against the person for which person may be arrested without warrant, or (c.1) any offence-related property, may at any time issue warrant authorizing peace officer or public officer who has been appointed or designated to administer or enforce federal or provincial law and whose duties include the enforcement of this Act or any other Act of Parliament and who is named in the warrant (d) to search the building, receptacle or place for any such thing and to seize it, and (e) subject to any other Act or Parliament, to, as soon as practicable, bring the thing seized before, or make report in respect thereof to, the justice or some other justice for the same territorial division in accordance with section 489.1.","The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search.
The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights.
HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.
 1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid.
That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2)
The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued.
The search was therefore warrantless.
3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair.
4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants.
The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA.
The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis.
5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter."
239,"[22] In short, I am satisfied that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from all of the evidence before the court is not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant, but that, because it contained items of such a personal nature, because the cocaine the defendant handed to Hyslop came from the knapsack, and because no one else had access to the knapsack, the defendant must have had knowledge of all of its contents and, for the same reasons, consented to their being there.","The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking.
When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer.
While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it.
The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash.
In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers.
They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle.
The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted.
The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle.
When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left.
The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial.
The defendant was found guilty on all charges.
The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession.
The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there.
The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking."
240,"At paragraph Hamilton J.A. states as follows: “I considered if this Rule authorizes me to issue summary judgment limited only to liability for the accident itself and not causation, because of its use of the words ""a part thereof"", but on reading the whole of Civil Procedure Rule 13.01, am satisfied that it means that summary judgment is not to be granted when there is any issue other than the amount of damages still in issue between the parties, which interpret to only be the case after causation has been determined as part of the summary judgment application.” [14] am satisfied upon reading the reports of Doctor Steve Crosby and Doctor Douglas Watt attached as appendices and to the plaintiff’s affidavit, the causation of certain amount of her physical injuries resulted from the accident.","The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment.
The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered.
The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working.
Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed.
There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle.
However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial."
241,"Werry for the Prospective Respondent City of Regina Application: From: Assessment Appeals Committee Saskatchewan Municipal Board Heard: May 11, 2005 Disposition: Leave granted Written Reasons: May 12, 2005 By: The Honourable Chief Justice Bayda BAYDA C.J.S.","The applicants apply for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 33.2(2) of The Municipal Board Act to appeal to this Court against the decision of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board Assessment Appeals Committee.
HELD: Leave is granted to appeal."
242,"The Ontario Court of Appeal held that nothing in the Divorce Act or the Guidelines gives court jurisdiction to re-calculate child support retroactively because of an increase in the payor’s income nor does failure to disclose an increase in income have that effect as there is no duty on payor to disclose absent contractual duty, court-ordered obligation or request from the payee for financial information pursuant to s. [19] Prior to the Alberta Court of Appeal trilogy, the “norm” in awarding retroactive child support was restricted to the date of the application for the order except in special circumstances (See: Headrick v.","The respondent applies to vary his 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for him.
In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month.
The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive.
HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.
 1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court.
In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2)
The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met.
If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3)
By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him.
The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her.
There was no justification for the payment to continue.
It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her."
243,"Counsel for the defendant submits that no such award can be made because the plaintiff did not expressly plead claim for aggravated damages. [18] In summary, the authorities relied upon by the defendant did not decide that plaintiff must specifically and expressly plead claim for aggravated damages, as opposed to alleging and proving the facts necessary to support such an award.","The plaintiff claims damages for injuries sustained when he was punched in the face and knocked unconscious by the defendant.
Liability is admitted.
The plaintiff applies for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 485 of the Queen's Bench Rules.
The parties agree that damages should be assessed on the basis of the affidavit evidence.
HELD: 1)
The defendant pled guilty to a charge of assault causing bodily harm.
He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30.
2) The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and significant pain for a number of months after the assault.
Extensive dental treatment was required and will be required at some point in the future.
The plaintiff has minimal scarring.
He is awarded general damages of $12,500.
3) The pleadings and the affidavit evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages.
However, the photographs graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered.
Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers.
These circumstances justify an award of aggravated damages in the sum of $2,000.
4) The plaintiff was awarded special damages in the amount of $1,911.70."
244,"[2] The Government of Saskatchewan (“the Government”) seeks an order: (1) pursuant to Rule 164(4) of The Queen’s Bench Rules requiring Thomas Bekkattla (“the Plaintiff”) to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars, and in default of so doing, striking the offending portions of the statement of claim; (2) pursuant to Rule 173 of the Rules striking the following pleadings: (a) Paragraph (b) From paragraph 21, the clause “(h) other assaults that will be proven at trial”; (c) From paragraph 23: (i) the words “breach of trust, and breach of fiduciary duty” where they appear in the third line, and (ii) the words “which include but” and “not limited to the following” in the fourth and fifth line, so that the phrase reads “the particulars are”; (d) From paragraph 27, the concluding words “the particulars of which will be proven at trial”; (e) From paragraph 30, the word “punitive” in the fifth line; (f) The whole of paragraphs 31 and 32; (g) The phrase “exemplary and punitive” in clause 33(d) and substituting the words “and exemplary”; (h) The whole of clause 33(e) “Damages for breach of fiduciary duty”; (i) The whole of clause 33(f) “Interest pursuant to The Pre-judgment Interest Act, S.S. 1984-85-86, c.","The Government seeks an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the plaintiff to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and pursuant to Rule 173 of the Rules and order striking portions of the pleadings.

The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet.
If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars.
If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state.
2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'.
The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.
 3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty.
The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.
 4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion.
The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5)
As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim."
245,"[26] While the Applicant may receive the benefit of the tuition credits for some of the children, many of the expenses that he is paying towards rent and food are not expenses for which he can claim deduction and thus, the additional amounts can only be compared to the $52,000 child and spousal support figure which is deductible on his income tax return, if one adjusts for tax implications to Dr. Boucher. (6) An order made under subsection (1) or an interim order under subsection (2) that provides for the support of spouse should (a) recognize any economic advantages or disadvantages to the spouses arising from the marriage or its breakdown; (b) apportion between the spouses any financial consequences arising from the care of any child of the marriage over and above any obligation for the support of any child of the marriage; (c) relieve any economic hardship of the spouses arising from the breakdown of the marriage; and (d) in so far as practicable, promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse within reasonable period of time.” [89] After almost 13 years of cohabitation and since separation, the mother has continued to receive spousal and child support; initially in the amount of $6,000 per month, then in 1995, $4,000 per month; then in July, 1996, $5,000 per month and, when the first two left home, in the amount of $4,000 per month.","The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce.
The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support.
Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education.
After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments.
The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home.
Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work.
The father now applied to terminate spousal support.
The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses.
Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself."
246,"[17] It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father’s position that the mother is an alcoholic and not properly caring for the child have any personal knowledge that that is the case, and that the information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained from third parties, the only one identified being Vivianne Tindall.","The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago.
During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday.
HELD: Appeal allowed orally.
 1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision.
2) The appeal must succeed.
Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree.
The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case.
It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3)
It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case.
The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall.
One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her.
4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered.
The report were not sworn or verified under oath.
 Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered.
Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father."
247,"B-3 setting aside the decision of the registrar dated July 20, 2006, upholding the disallowance of the claim of Pioneer Grain Company Limited, as a secured creditor in the proposal of Shane Paul Sabourin.","FIAT: The applicant applies for an order pursuant to Rule 30(1) of the general rules under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act setting aside the decision of the registrar upholding the disallowance of the applicant's claim as a secured creditor in the proposal.
HELD: In reviewing the registrar's judgment, it is clear that he succinctly and accurately set forth the facts of the matter and that to that end there has been no complaint regarding the judgment.
The court considered the registrar's analysis in this matter and can find no fault with his reasoning.
The registrar's interpretation is supported by the legislation and, based upon the undisputed facts which he found, the interpretation is reasonable.
The application is dismissed."
248,(collectively called “Sullivan”) for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. IV [18] The only remaining sole issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff.,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine.
The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff.
HELD: 1)
There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended.
An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends.
He did not prepare the proposals during working hours.
He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina.
However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract.
Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff.
2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal.
There were no union members available for it to hire.
It had no employees ready to perform the contract.
It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December.
If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage.
3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff.
He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets.
He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff.
He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret.
4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs."
249,"directed a trial on the issues of the residence of Michael in 2006; the incomes of the father and mother, for the purposes of the Federal Child Support Guidelines [SOR/97-175, as am.] (the “Guidelines”); and, any s. [17] Section of the Guidelines provides as follows: 7.(1) In child support order the court may, on either spouse's request, provide for an amount to cover all or any portion of the following expenses, which expenses may be estimated, taking into account the necessity of the expense in relation to the child's best interests and the reasonableness of the expense in relation to the means of the spouses and those of the child and to the family's spending pattern prior to the separation: (a) child care expenses incurred as result of the custodial parent's employment, illness, disability or education or training for employment; (b) that portion of the medical and dental insurance premiums attributable to the child; (c) health‑related expenses that exceed insurance reimbursement by at least $100 annually, including orthodontic treatment, professional counselling provided by psychologist, social worker, psychiatrist or any other person, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and prescription drugs, hearing aids, glasses and contact lenses; (d) extraordinary expenses for primary or secondary school education or for any other educational programs that meet the child's particular needs; (e) expenses for post‑secondary education; and (f) extraordinary expenses for extracurricular activities.","The parties have two children, a son born March 1990 and a daughter December 1991.
A trial on the issues of the son's residence in 2006, the parties' income for the purposes of child support and any s. 7 expenses was held.
HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son.
This is a period of no more than 5 months.
Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother.
The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.
 2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629.
The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3)
The parties have been divorced since 1998.
The son has played baseball since 2004.
The daughter has speed skated since 2001.
The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father.
It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses.
Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him.
To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.
 4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines.
The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually.
The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years.
The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription.
The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%.
Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5)
Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes.
The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794.
His income is considerably higher now.
His child support payments are adjusted accordingly."
250,"27) am also satisfied that the parties based their October, 2005 verbal agreement for child support on Mr. Gavelin’s 2004 income.","FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005.
The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access.
The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive.
The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child.
That is the situation here.
There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis.
In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible.
The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation.
That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday.
This seems reasonable on an interim basis.
This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring.
It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased.
The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months.
He will have to be re-introduced to them.
A phase in period is required. 2)
The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years.
His gross income in 2006 was $112,064.
This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer.
The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes.
This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary.
The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3)
The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application.
The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006.
The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005.
He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006.
He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children.
The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.
 The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's.
The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs.
The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship.
There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application.
A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted."
251,"He points out that on November 1, 2005 Parliament amended the Criminal Code to provide one year minimum sentence for the distribution of child pornography, which became law approximately six weeks after Mr. Houston was charged in this matter.","Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works.
The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls.
HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry.
The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem.
The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society.
For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles.
The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images.
The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world.
Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same.
2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it.
A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence.
Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother."
252,"However, the respondent points to the judge’s reference to Schoenthal (the only case cited by the sentencing judge and case of criminal negligence causing death rather than manslaughter) as putting the unlawful act in the lowest Laberge category.","The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter.
The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation.
The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.
 2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities.
In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility.
It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review.
However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor.
The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances."
253,"[Emphasis added] [12] The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were liable in negligence on the basis that Sebastian was in breach of his duty of care because he failed to properly identify the nature and extent of the Homeowners’ existing insurance coverage, which he could easily have done by carefully reviewing copy of the McCallum Hill SGI policy.","The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners.
Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners.
The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners.
Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance.
The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment.
The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal.
The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal.
SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care.
HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed.
Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant.
The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian.
It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs.
There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian.
The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients."
254,"“[3] The factors enunciated in the foregoing cases for determining parental status are: a) changing the child’s name to that of the respondent; b) discussing the possibility of adopting the child; c) the child’s reference to the respondent as ‘Dad’ or ‘Mom’; d) the child’s perception of the respondent as father or mother figure; e) the age of the child; f) the duration of the child’s relationship with the respondent; g) whether the respondent participates in disciplining the child; h) whether the respondent provided financial support for the child; i) whether the application is for interim or final support; j) whether there has been any intention to terminate the relationship; k) whether the child has relationship with the noncustodial biological parent; l) whether any other person is obligated to support the child; m) whether the respondent spends time personally with the child; n) whether the respondent is “psychological parent”; o) whether the respondent has ever sought custody of or access to the child; p) the nature of the post separation conduct of the applicant or the respondent, such as denial by the applicant of access to the child by the respondent.” [17] In this case, Ms. McPhail asserts that Dr. Hunt treated the children as his own and acted as their parent.","The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse.
She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children.
The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt.
The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him).
They separated in July 2008.
The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997.
The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000.
HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children.
The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits.
The determination will have to be made after trial.
2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation.
The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case.
In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay.
The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000.
Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth.
The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested.
A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems.
The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term.
A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount.
The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.
 3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court.
It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner.
The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed."
255,"117 (Q.B.) [4] In my view, the findings of fact by the learned trial judge are reasonably supported by the evidence and there is no palpable and overriding error. R. 308 (Q.B.) and Regina (City) v. R. 271 (Q.B.) [5] Nor did the learned trial judge make a palpable and overriding error in interpreting the evidence and applying the pertinent provisions of The Consumer Protection Act, S.","The appellant appeals the judgment of the Provincial Court pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act, 1997.
HELD: The findings of fact by the trial judge are reasonably supported by the evidence and there is no palpable and overriding error.
The learned judge did not make an error in law."
256,"Nevertheless she has concluded that it would be best for the children at this time for (the husband) and to have shared parenting relationship in which, when either of us is not sailing offshore, the children are in our care for equal amounts of time” This suggests that whatever occurred between the parties has not caused the wife concern about the husband’s ability to appropriately parent these children. Although the children were primarily in the husband’s care, when the parties arranged for the children to be parented by the wife, she did so in the matrimonial and the husband moved out for that period of time.","The parties were separated and had difficulty communicating.
They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three).
The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50).
She alleged the husband was abusive.
The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children.
Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times).
The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded.
If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that.
Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan.
Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation.
A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance.
Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting."
257,"and, better particulars of any matter of which particulars should properly be given and such notices shall clearly state the particulars required.” Unlike Rule 139, which has as its main purpose the provision of sufficient particulars to enable a defendant to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiffs’ claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence, Rule 164 has a different, but similar, scope.","The litigation revolved around a claim by the plaintiffs for damages that resulted from a motor vehicle accident.
The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006.
In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury.
Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery.
HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence.
Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery.
In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery.
The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars."
258,"Heather Robertson Heard: February 9, 2011, in Halifax, Nova Scotia SUPPLEMENTARY WRITTEN DECISION: February 16, 2011 Counsel: Colin Piercey and Tricia Barry, for the plaintiff, respondent Stephen Kingston and Justin Kimball, for the defendants, moving parties Robertson, J.: [1] By a motion dated December 16, 2010, the defendants sought an order confirming their ability to pay certain amounts for billed and unbilled time of their respective legal counsel, as well as retainers with respect to ongoing litigation, without such payments violating the terms of two execution orders previously issued February 18, 2010, as Hfx No. 190408 against the defendant judgment debtors to the plaintiff herein, who were successful litigants in this action.","The judge declared the defendants could pay legal fees from third party loans without offending two prior execution orders that prevented them from disposing of any property.
The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets.
Later, the defendants' counsel wrote to the court essentially indicating he could not confirm the loans would not be secured against any assets.
The court issued this supplemental decision.
In the absence of any evidence the loans will not be secured against assets already subject to the execution order, or will not otherwise reduce those assets, the order and declaration sought can no longer be granted."
259,"On the weakness side of the equation Dr. Greenough notes the following in relation to M.S.: She comes from an abusive home, lack of stable work, history of drug use and no identified treatment; criminal involvements; risk taking, impulsive behaviour, weak and unchanged parenting skills; unrealistic career aspirations; unstable volatile relationship with P.K., did not complete the alternative to violence program; number of mental health issues and no sustained commitment to treatment; lack motivation to seek treatment; lack pro-social support; history with Social Services and lack of compliance with previous orders; motivation for attending classes driven by the Court process. [28] The Ministry argues that given the extensive past history involving three older children of M.S. and P.K., the Ministry properly apprehended T.J.E.S. pursuant to section 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry states the permanency planning committee was of the opinion there was no use putting off the inevitable.","The Ministry brought an application for a permanent order for the child pursuant to s. 37 of The Child and Family Services Act.
The Minister apprehended the child at birth.
The mother's three older children had been apprehended with two other older children placed with a person of sufficient interest and the third child was made a permanent ward of the Ministry.
The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child.
The mother and the child's father had separated with the father supporting the mother having the child returned to her care and the father having access to the child.
HELD: There was no basis for the initial apprehension as the child was not in need of protection.
The child shall be returned to the mother who is a person who has a right of custody of the child pursuant to s. 36(3) of the Child and Family Services Act.
This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry with the child to be completely returned to the mother within 30 days of this order.
There was no evidence presented at trial regarding attempts by the Ministry to pursue any less intrusive alternatives and instead proceeded directly to the most severe position being a permanent order.
The evidence did not justify the Ministry's position."
260,"He said this deficiency came about because: (1) Cst. Granrude’s notes and General Occurrence Report provided to the defence did not disclose observations about Mr. Charron’s condition at the detachment that Cst. Granrude described in his testimony at the trial; and (2) The Operational Checksheet provided to the defence (Exhibit D-1) did not contain notations under the heading of Observations on Subject that included the words “slurred speech” and “two beer started around 2100"", as was contained in the original Checksheet which was filed by the Crown as Exhibit P-2 during the re-direct examination of Cst.

During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying.
During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech.
In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.
 The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence.
HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document.
The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown.
The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out.
While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence.
This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1)."
261,"Position of the Plaintiff [15] The Plaintiff’s position is that the Defendant is in breach of the agreement to successfully supply and install the business equipment; that they had continuing agreement until at least the summer of 2009, due to the continuing representations of the Defendant; that P2 is valid written contract between the two parties; and that the Defendant is in fundamental breach of their contract.","The plaintiff entered into a verbal agreement for the defendant to supply and install business equipment.
The plaintiff alleged that the equipment sold never worked properly and sought damages for breach of contract and, in the alternative, damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, damages for negligent misrepresentation, and damages for unjust enrichment in the amount of $20,000.
HELD: The Court dismissed the action as the plaintiff did not establish its case on a balance of probabilities.
 The Limitations Act applies and the action was barred.
The defendant agreed to supply and install the equipment which was done; there was no agreement to maintain, service or reprogram equipment.
There was no material misrepresentation or fraud or concealment of facts, nor unjust enrichment."
262,"May 30, 2013 [1] Further to the hearing of this matter on May 7, 2013, the issue remaining to be determined is whether the children are to be, on an interim basis, relocated from La Ronge to live with the respondent at Melville, Saskatchewan. Dueck, 2012 SKCA 109 (CanLII), 399 Sask.R. 303 where Richards J.A. commented on the relocation of children on an interim basis when he said the following at para.","The issue to be determined was whether the parties' children should remain in La Ronge or be relocated to live with the respondent in Melville on an interim basis.
The parties were in a common law relationship and had two children, aged 9 and 12.
After separation, the children resided with their mother, the respondent, in La Ronge and they had access with the petitioner on the weekends.
In January 2011, the parties agreed to a weekly co-parenting arrangement.
In April 2013 the petitioner was advised by the respondent that she and the children had moved to Melville.
Up until that point the child had always resided in the La Ronge area and attended only one school.
HELD: The Court found the co-parenting arrangement to be the de facto parenting arrangement and that there was no risk to the children with either parent.
The Court ordered that the parties were joint custodians of the children and that preservation of the status quo was in their best interests.
The Court ordered that the children primarily reside in La Ronge with the petitioner and attend school there.
The Court also ordered specified access for the respondent."
263,"The purpose of paragraph 68 is to establish that Mr. Banga’s impugned statements related to the plaintiffs, and, as such, the facts pleaded, are clearly material and ought not to be struck.","Civil Procedure – Pleadings – Statement of Claim – Striking OutCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 7-9
The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants that included three causes of action: a claim against Xtreme Mining and Banga for wrongful dismissal; a claim for defamation brought against Banga; and for inducing breach of contract against Potash Corp.
The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial.
The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants.
Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment.
The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose.
The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation.
The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media.
HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition.
Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time.
It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial."
264,"By the terms of the 2011 Variation Order, the parties left to a future court the finalization of the amount of child support based on Mr. Prescesky’s income.","Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal
The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645.
The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334).
An original support order was issued by consent in 2006.
It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable.
In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month.
In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000.
The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year.
One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances.
In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose.
The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him.
The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income.
The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears.
The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them.
In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009.
Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial.
The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct.
The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established.
The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order.
He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.
 HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act.
Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order.
The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income.
Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay."
265,"[12] Following their separation in October 2012, the petitioner’s application was brought back and heard by Kraus J., who issued the following fiat dated November 22, 2012: The interim order made September 28, 2010 granted joint custody to the parents of their four (4) children, age 10, and (the twins), with primary residence to the mother, access to the father at reasonable times, no less than every second weekend from Friday evening to Sunday evening, and one evening every week from 5:00 until 7:00 p.m. Following the interim order, the parents proceeded to pre-trial conference on October 29, 2010 where they entered into Memorandum of Understanding, confirming the father’s access on the weekend following the pre-trial conference but somewhat changing weekday access.","Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage.
They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children.
The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner.
The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend.
The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again.
In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order.
At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order.
A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially.
The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014.
In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent.
They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends.
The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends.
The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him.
HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial.
In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012.
The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner."
266,"[40] I have concluded, as argued by the Crown, that Mr. Drysdale’s actions in leaving the area of confrontation and going back to his dufflebag to retrieve the knife and thereafter approaching Mr. Brown with the knife in his hand, pursuing him in the parking lot as he ran away, and using the knife to slash Mr. Brown’s vehicle’s tire, was completely out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat that Mr. Drysdale may have perceived was made or presented by Mr. Brown in the circumstances of this case.","Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence
The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code.
The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation.
The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife.
The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle.
The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused.
A knife was also located in the yard.
A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court.
The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers.
The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident.
He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to.
He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out.
The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them.
He said that he did not intend to stab them.
At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not.
The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle.
The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode.
The accused raised the issue of self-defence.
HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.
The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him.
The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires.
The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect.
The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused.
The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer.
The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat.
The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence.
The accused was found guilty as charged."
267,"The defendants first applied to terminate on May 6, 2014 four months after the Order was granted alleging that the proceedings taken by the plaintiff in Turkey to prove and enforce guarantees executed by Mr. Arslan [Turkish Proceedings] had failed, and that the plaintiff had failed to prosecute those proceedings without delay.","Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8
The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim.
ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants.
The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs.
Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt.
ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act.
The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied.
Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff.
The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014.
The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA.
The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim.
If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000.
HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted.
The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed.
The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs.
The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice.
The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay.
The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.
 The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim.
The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order.
The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24."
268,"Minister of National Revenue 1978 CanLII 13 (SCC), [1978], 24 N.R. 163 (S.C.C.), concerns an interpretion of the relevant provisions of the Federal Court Act. am more persuaded by the decisions in Morin v.","The applicant union sought an order of mandamus with certiorari in aid, ordering the defendant Minister to exercise his discretion to appoint an arbitrator to hear a grievance.

Quite apart from certification and voluntary recognition, the union could attain bargaining rights pursuant to Part II of the Trade Union Act, which allowed an employer in the construction industry to assign bargaining and negotiating rights to an 'accredited employers' association' such as the Construction Management Labour Bureau Ltd.
The Court ordered the Minister to exercise his discretion under s.107(4) of the Act according to law as set out in Part II of the Act and confirmed by the Appeal Division in Boyd &amp; Garland."
269,"The plaintiff's solicitor appeared at the scheduled examinations but neither Leo nor Louis Dion appeared, nor did anyone else appear on behalf of the corporate defendant, nor did the defendants' counsel appear.","The plaintiff applied under Queen's Bench Rule 231 to strike the statements of defence of a corporate and individual defendant for failure to attend scheduled examinations despite service of an appointment and payment of conduct money to their solicitor.
The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences.
Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution.
Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend.
The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer.
This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants.
The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors.
HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply.
He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates.
Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks."
270,"The situation is not unlike the common case in which plaintiff succeeds on an issue of fault but fails to prove part of his claim."" Unlike other areas of civil litigation where costs are awarded, as general rule, where party is successful in obtaining an award greater than any offer made prior to litigation, the practice in cases involving contributory negligence appears to be to apportion costs in the same percentage as the findings of fault.","The plaintiff was found to be two-thirds and the defendant one-third responsible for an accident which occurred when the defendant's car hit the plaintiff as she tried to cross the highway on her bicycle.
The court awarded costs to the plaintiff fixed at the amount involved - the quantum of general damages.
The parties were unable to reach an amount of settlement.
In this matter, the defendant argued that the costs should be fixed at the amount actually recovered by the plaintiff.
Awarding the plaintiff one-third of her taxed costs,
that to reduce costs by the percentage of fault of the plaintiff and to reduce the amount involved would be a double reduction."
271,"March 24, 1994 The plaintiffs Clarence Gill and Shirley Gill (""Clarence and Shirley"") claim against Ford Motor Company of Canada Limited (""Ford"") for damages from a fire in their garage which they allege was caused by combustion of vapours from gasoline leakage from the fuel tube of a new truck they purchased from Ford. THEORY OF THE PLAINTIFFS The plaintiffs contend that the fire was caused by an electrostatic discharge through the U-shaped fuel tube in the Ford truck which was the subject of recall, along with 48,000 others, by Ford.","The Plaintiff's 1989 Ford F150 1/2 ton truck caught fire and burned in his garage.

The Plaintiff called several expert witnesses who testified that, in their opinion, the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire.
Ford called one witness who was the designer of of the truck's fuel system and a Ford employee.
He testified that the defective fuel line could not have leaked sufficient fuel to cause the fire.
He also admitted, however, that his prior written report contained errors.
Rebuttal evidence called by the Plaintiff indicated that the check valve in the fuel pump designed to prevent siphoning from the fuel tank in the event of a leaking fuel line did not operate as the Ford witness had testified.
HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.
The Plaintiff had proved on a balance of probabilities that the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire.
The Plaintiff's experts' evidence was accepted over that of the Ford expert.
No independent experts had been called by Ford."

The Applicant shall enter into an undertaking containing the following terms before any videotape is released to him: i.) That he will not make copy of any videotape provided by the Crown of interviews conducted with the complainant in the investigation of the pending charge against him under S. In result, and in all the circumstance of this application, the claim of the applicant to the right of review and study of the complainant statements, written and videotaped, on his own and away from the office of counsel, and his right to utilize them as claimed, are not essential to provide disclosure and his right to fair trial and to make full answer and defence.","FIAT The accused, who was charged with two counts of sexual assault involving complainants 15 and 13 years of age, applied for a remedy under ss.24(1) of the Charter of Rights compelling the respondent to provide full disclosure to him, without trust conditions or undertakings of any sort.
HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter.
The obligation to disclose is not absolute.
The Corwn's obligation to protect the privacy of the complainants is fulfuilled by providing the statements and videotapes to counsel for the accused on trust condition that counsel retain them in his possession.
The information contained therein is available to the accused and retained experts for use in preparing his defence.
Since the accused knows the sustance of the complaints and, therefore, the case he has to meet, there is no danger to the fairness of the trial by virtue of the trust condition attached to disclosure.
The public interest is served and the integrity of the criminal justice system is maintained when complainants are assured that staements and videotapes will not be reproduced.

The trial judge found the Blazer was stolen just before 12:15 a.m. on March 11, 1995 as result of break and enter; that the appellant was in the Blazer when it was stopped by the police and that it had been recently stolen; that the appellant ran from the vehicle and made the tracks in the snow which were followed by the police, and that the time periods for the happening of each and all of these events were consistent with his findings of fact.","This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.
The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning.
The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals.
Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook.
Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing.
The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow.
The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession.
He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle.
Dismissing the appeal,
that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge.
The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.)."
275,"In reference to the plaintiff specifically, and the abortion procedure, he stated in his report as follows: ""I would have felt that it was not advisable for patient to drive home on their own, not only after such procedure but especially after such procedure and having taken Ativan. The central issue is whether the health care professionals should have been aware that the plaintiff could be affected in her ability to drive motor vehicle by either the sedative given to her prior to the abortion, the local anesthetic administered during the procedure, or by the possibility that she would faint after leaving the client as result of the emotional impact of having had an abortion.","The plaintiff had an abortion at a Halifax clinic.
The plaintiff was in the recovery room for 30 to 45 minutes after the procedure, and then left.
On the drive home, she was injured in a motor vehicle accident when she fainted and her car crossed the centre line of the highway and struck another vehicle.
She sued three members of the clinic staff, including the doctor who performed the abortion, alleging negligence in letting her drive after the abortion.
Awarding the plaintiff $724,000 for past and future loss of income, future loss of pension, and general damages,
that based on the evidence of the possible complications from surgery such as an abortion, and considering the emotional impact of an abortion on all women, the defendants breached their standard of care as health care professionals in permitting the plaintiff to drive after the abortion."
276,"[13] Accordingly, a trial of the issue is directed to determine whether the respondents are in breach of the covenants of their lease as alleged with respect to the grounds stated by Russell in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d), supra.","Landlord and Tenant - Writ of Possession_____
The landlord applied for an order for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act.
The 41 month lease required a monthly rental of $500 for the first five months and thereafter semi-annual payments of $5,000.
The tenants had not paid any rent in 1998 nor had they maintained insurance; they installed alternating stalls in the barn in breach of their covenant not to make any alterations or additions to the premises; breached the express and implied covenants to keep the premises in good condition and tenantable repair by their failure to remove and properly dispose of baler twine, to maintain proper weed control or to remove manure buildup in the calf barn.
The tenants admitted the rental payment was due in May but claimed the landlord breached the pre-condition wherein Russell's husband promised to repair the damage caused by a 1995 hail storm.
The claims for repair was far in excess of those provided for in the lease which were the tenant's responsibility._____
HELD: 1)The landlord was entitled to a writ of possession since the tenants were in breach of the covenant to pay rent for more than two calendar months.
2)A trial of the issue was ordered to determine whether the tenants were in breach of covenants in the lease.
The matter should not be decided summarily where there are questions of fact or law.
The hail damage may allow the tenants to claim in damages against the landlord but it could not be construed as a debt due for the purposes of s27 of the Landlord and Tenant Act.
The remaining alleged breaches could not be determined summarily.
 3)Costs of the application were awarded to the landlord in any event of the cause."
277,"185 of the Act which provides: ""185 The insurer may refuse to pay benefit to person or may reduce the amount of benefit or suspend or terminate the benefit, where the person: (a) knowingly provides false or inaccurate information to the insurer; (b) refuses or neglects to produce information reasonably required by the insurer for the purposes of this Part or to provide an authorization reasonably required by the insurer to obtain the information; (c) without valid reason, refuses to return to his or her former employment, leaves an employment that he or she could continue to hold, or refuses new employment; (d) without valid reason, neglects or refuses to undergo and examination by practitioner, or interferes with an examination by practitioner, requested or required by the insurer; (e) without valid reason, refuses, does not follow or is not available for treatment recommended by practitioner and the insurer; (f) without valid reason, prevents or delays recovery by his or her activities; (g) without valid reason, does not follow or participate in rehabilitation program made available by the insurer; or (h) prevents or obstructs the insurer from exercising any of its rights of recovery or subrogation pursuant to this Part."" [5] On April 14, 1997 Sawkiw was in motor vehicle accident and suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine.","An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits.
The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver.
He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties.
HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g).
SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances.
SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time.
It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting.
It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations.
He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit.
2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta.
However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work.
Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment.
3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith.
If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a).
Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received.
He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations."
278,"[9] Based on this medical evidence, and on his own testimony that the back pain he suffered after June of 1995 was in the same area as the pain he suffered after the accident, Peters claimed to have met the onus on him of proving that the accident caused the disc herniation.","The applicant sustained a lower back injury in an automobile accident in February 1995 which resolved within ten days to two weeks.
In June 1995 he began to experience pain in his back which slowly worsened until he was hospitalized in October 1995.
He was diagnosed with a large central and right sided disc herniation.
SGI denied his claim for income replacement benefits as a non-earner under s.117(1) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.
In issue was whether the accident caused the disc herniation.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The plaintiff had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities.
Two family physicians supported his contention but the medical director of rehabilitation services for SGI and the orthopaedic surgeon who treated the applicant were both of the opinion the herniation was not caused by the accident."
279,"The Court not only accepts Mr. Maguire's evidence on this issue but also finds that at the relevant time of October to October 8, Mr. Duce had not yet expressed, and perhaps had not yet even formed, the opinion that the Marley formation in which leg one was primarily drilled was capable of producing or that leg one should have immediately been placed on production.","Coachlight sought an order requiring the defendant to pay the balance of its 35% share of $681,955.58 as costs for drilling a petroleum/natural gas well plus $49,701.61 representing its 35% share of the lifting and production costs under the Operating Agreement.
The plaintiff also sought a declaration that it holds builders' liens against the defendant's interest in the Well and other joint interest assets to the extent of the debts due.
Duce Oil denies liability for any costs of the horizontal well in excess of $447,535 being 110% of the authorization for expenditure executed with respect to the Well.
The defendant counterclaimed on the basis the plaintiff conducted certain operations without authority, was negligent in conducting operations and overcharged or made improper charges in its accounting procedures.
HELD: 1)Duce was liable for $96,286.95 representing 35% of the unpaid costs of the original and supplemental authorization for expenditures (AFE) and the costs of the screw pump.
2)Duce was responsible for $49,701.61 representing regular lifting and production costs and other joint interest wells plus expenditures under $25,000 which did not require an AFE.
3)Coachlight was only entitled to interest from the time of its written notice on June 20/94 that it was exercising its option under the CAPL 1981 to charge interest.
4)In default of payment within 90 days of Judgment the plaintiff would be entitled to a builders' lien in the entire estate or interest of the defendant in all petroleum, natural gas and other hydrocarbons except coal and valuable stone, upon or under the lands as specified together with all proceeds from the defendant's interests in petroleum and natural gas and its interest in fixtures, machinery, tools, appliances and other property in any of the defendant's oil or gas wells on those lands.
5)The totality of the evidence did not support the portrayal by the defendant of the plaintiff as a high handed, arrogant operator who simply forgot it had a minority partner.
 6)The plaintiff was entitled to its taxable costs."
280,"[2] In answer to the plaintiff’s proceeding, the Crown’s defence, in paragraphs and 9, reads: 8) In the further alternative, the Defendant states if the Plaintiff has suffered injury, damage or loss in the course of her military service, which is not admitted but denied, she is entitled to pension benefits pursuant to the Pension Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act cannot be read having regard to these authorities to amount to the proposition that having been denied pension by the government for sexual assault the Plaintiff is now barred from bringing an action for damages against the government claiming that she is now entitled to pension.","After being sexually assaulted, applicant was voluntarily released from Canadian Armed Forces.
She applied for and was denied a pension.
Civil proceedings were commenced and the Crown defended on the basis that before initiating civil proceedings, applicant was obliged to appeal denial of pension or seek review by Minister of pension rejection.
Applicant applied to strike out that portion of defence
application allowed.
The applicant applied for and was denied a pension.
Therefore no pension was at this time payable to her.
A review by the Minister would require new information and the appeal period had expired.
The applicant should not be denied her right to proceed against the Crown in such circumstances."
281,"In addition, Crown counsel indicated to the Court in oral argument, and in its written brief in the passage quoted above, that the reason it wanted to proceed with the Schafer matter first was that if the Court in that matter determined that certain of the particular incidents or dealings relied upon in that charge were not fraudulent, (i.e. the investors were simply not defrauded in relation to those matters) then “the Crown would have to consider carefully whether to proceed in relation to those matters in relation to Leibel.” [23] Certainly, it appears to have been Klebuc J.’s understanding that his findings would have some bearing on the proceedings against Leibel, for, following closing arguments, he stated that he would take time to give lengthy reasons for two reasons: “Number one, to work my way through it and make sure don’t miss anything; and secondly, provide you with some guidance with respect to the other case that’s outstanding.” [24] The Crown takes the position that it is not in any way bound in this proceeding by any of the findings of the Court in the Schafer matter.","FIAT. The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial.
He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith.
HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed.
The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests.
The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time.
2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended.
The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs.
To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process.
The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d).
2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay.
There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges."
282,"18 The SEA states that an order made or issued by the Lieutenant Governor in Council must be judicially considered (section 10), however the order in this case appears to have been made or issued by the Minister rather than the Lieutenant Governor in Council and so copy of the order (""any official or public document"") could be received in evidence only if it had been certified under the hand of person in whose custody the document had been placed (section 12 and section 18).","The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act.
No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer.
The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case.
HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b).
It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.
 1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied.
Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.
 2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given.
The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given.
The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public.
Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish.
3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described.
The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA).
It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA)."
283,"[11] must decide the case as presented; that the plaintiffs are entitled to damages from the defendants for breach of contract dated January 21, 1997 and with reference to the contract between the defendants and the City of Regina.","This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants.
The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association.
The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract.
Both matters were tried together.
The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P.
HELD: Both actions were dismissed.
1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity.
While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association.
2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work.
The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference.
The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs.
They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.
 3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required.
The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work."

Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined.
HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.
 2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old.
The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year.
The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes.
Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines.
The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon.
The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children.
One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children.
4)Spousal support was not ordered.
The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future.
Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same.
5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal.
Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000.
There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops.
6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs.

285,Adding Parties for the Purposes of Pursuing an Appeal: [5] R.B. submits that there are two bases on which this Court may add her as party for the purposes of appealing the permanent care order. [10] R.B. submits that Chambers judge generally has authority to deal with procedural matters and the addition of party for the purposes of bringing an appeal is such matter.,"The applicant grandparent applied to the Court of Appeal to be made a party to the proceeding so that she could appeal a permanent care order made in respect of her granddaughter.
Application dismissed;
a judge of the Court of Appeal in Chambers does not have the authority to make the order requested; in any event, an application in the Family Division for leave to terminate the permanent care order would be a more appropriate way for the applicant to proceed."

He was laid off his employment in 1996 and ceased support payments.
His common law spouse died suddenly in 1997 and he has remained the sole care and support for their mentally handicapped child.
He appealed the dismissal of his application in March 2000 to vary the support order by suspending payment until he gained employment and by reducing arrears.
HELD: The appeal was allowed in part.
He must obtain employment when his health allows.
Arrears were reduced to $5,000 and enforcement was stayed so long as he continues to make monthly payments of $30 to Maintenance Enforcement."
287,[5] Significant argument was centred on whether the bonuses were paid from the corporation’s current income (the wife’s argument) or from the corporation’s prior year’s income (the husband’s argument).,"FIAT. The issue in this application to vary spousal support was whether there had been a material change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support since their 1999 interspousal contract.
The wife requested a 50% increase based on the husband's income increase of 50%.
She suffered from MS and was unable to work.
HELD: Spousal support was varied to $3,500 monthly.
The only material change in the wife's means and needs is that fact she is residing with a new partner who resides in her home in exchange for yard work and housework.
Although he worked, he made no apparent financial contribution to the household.
The wife was awarded costs fixed at $1,000."
288,"In so doing, it asked that its solicitor, Mr. Hesje, be appointed as selling officer to conduct the sale and report to the Court.","The applicant applied for an order for judicial sale following the service of a statement of claim on the respondents in which it sought foreclosure or alternative relief.
 In so doing, it asked that its solicitor, Mr. Hesje, be appointed as selling officer to conduct the sale and report to the Court.
The court expressed its concern to Mr. Hesje during the course of his submissions as to the propriety of the applicant solicitor serving in such a dual function.
He informed the court that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined.
In the court's respectful view, it is not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor.
There are obvious difficulties with conflict of interest.
Who does the selling officer serve: the Court, from which his or her authority originates; or the client?
The matter is of sufficient importance that the court concluded it should reduce its thoughts to a fiat and direct that it be distributed to other members of the Court.
To be fair, Mr. Hesje indicated he was perfectly willing to have another member of the Law Society unconnected to the proceedings appointed as selling officer.
The court understood that Grant Richards of Cuelenaere Kendall Katzman Watson &amp; Hagen will serve in this role as opposed to Mr. Hesje."

The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice.
The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years.
Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs.
HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act.
2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100.
There must be some justification for retroactive support orders.
This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support.
He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002.
It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court.
3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts.
There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated.
While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party.
The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties.
The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary.
Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted.
4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed."
290,[5] The defendant testified that there was half-ton truck in front of his tractor unit in the intersection shortly before the accident occurred; the defendant’s wife was with him that morning and corroborated his version of the facts as to the presence of the half-ton truck and as to the fact that neither she nor her husband saw the Honda Accord until just after the actual collision when Mrs. Procyshyn told her husband that his tractor unit was nudging another vehicle that must be in front of them.,"At issue in the negligence suit was whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff's vehicle in front of him and stopped his vehicle to avoid the motor vehicle collision.
The only material difference in testimonies was whether there was a half-ton truck in front of the plaintiff's vehicle when the collision occurred.
HELD: The plaintiff's claim was not proven on a balance of probabilities.
The physical evidence did not assist and the court was unable to conclude that one version was correct and the other incorrect."

FIAT. A motion for summary judgment under Queen's Bench Rule 485 governing simplified procedure.
The plaintiff claimed the creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account for a lesser sum ($2,000 on a $15,600 account).
He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'.
The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001.
In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle.
An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died.
The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible.
SGI initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in May 2002 claiming $17,660.
The defendant contended that, if there was an accord and satisfaction, it was avoided due to mistake of fact or misrepresentation.
HELD: The application for summary judgment was dismissed.
A summary trial was ordered.
Costs in the cause.
Whether the plaintiff's remarks constituted an operative misrepresentation could not be resolved in the absence of cross-examination."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The interpretation of the arbitrator was a possible interpretation on a legal and grammatical analysis of the entire agreement, and was not patently unreasonable."
293,[11] Leave to appeal is thereby granted on the following two questions of law: (1) Did the Committee err in its interpretation and application of the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual by failing to find that economic obsolescence for size must be categorized on MAF by MAF basis?; and (2) Did the Committee err by failing to find the Assessor should have used the comparable unit method to determine whether an adjustment for obsolescence for size should be applied to the applicant’s property?,"The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of the Municipal Board Act.
The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply abnormal obsolescence to the owner's property.
The issues also relate to 15 other properties and as the issues are the same for each property they were decided by the Assessment Appeals Committee on one appeal.
The Assessment Appeals Committee dismissed the appeals, finding the issue not to be a matter of the Assessor's Discretion but a matter of professional interpretation of data.
The Committee found the Board of Revision did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err on the issue of abnormal obsolescence for size.
HELD: Leave to appeal was granted on two questions of law.
 1) Did the Committee err in its interpretation and application of the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual by failing to find that economic obsolescence for size must be categorized on a MAF by MAF basis? 2)
Did the Committee err by failing to find the Assessor should have used the comparable unit method to determine whether an adjustment for obsolescence for size should be applied to the applicant's property?
3) On the use of invalid sales leave was denied on the basis the question of the sale is a question of fact and in argument the applicant said for its purposes the impugned sale did not matter.
4) Leave to appeal was denied on the issue of the standard of proof that there was no error demonstrated."

295,"that the implement will be durable if used under fit and suitable conditions and kept with proper care and that parts proving defective will be replaced free of charge upon return of the defective parts to the dealer’s place of business or to the distributor; and that, where the purchaser returns the implement to the dealer’s place of business, the dealer will install the new parts without charge; and that all parts replaced within the warranty period are warranted to be durable for the duration of the original one-year warranty or for ninety days from the date of installation, whichever is longer; [11] In its claim the plaintiff asserts that the Spreader was “entirely unfit for spreading compost” and did not meet the warranties imposed by operation of the Act. The plaintiff claims judgment for the purchase price of the Spreader in the sum of $37,000.00 and damages for repairs to the Spreader in the sum of $2,344.00, pre-judgment interest and costs.","The plaintiff bought a spreader from the defendant Apollo Distributing Corporation (Apollo).
The defendant Meyer Mfg. Corp. (Meyer) manufactured the spreader and did not defend the action.
The plaintiff claims that the spreader was entirely unfit for spreading compost and did not meet the warranties imposed by The Agricultural Implements Act.
The plaintiff claimed judgment for the purchase price and damages for repairs to the spreader.
HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed.
The plaintiff did not establish that the spreader was not fit for the purpose of spreading compost or that it was not manufactured in compliance with the warranties in the Act.
1) Other than the fact of a chain breakage on two separate occasions, there was no evidence produced by the plaintiff addressing the cause of breakage.
2) If deficiencies did exist in the spreader, the dealer or distributor are expressly entitled to an opportunity to repair or correct the deficiencies, upon receipt of notice in writing.
The defendants were deprived of the opportunity to inspect and repair by the unreasonable actions of the plaintiff in his failure to allow the return of the spreader.
3) The plaintiff did not establish that written notice was provided to the defendants as required by s. 36.3(b) of the Act.
The Court could not find that the dealer or distributor led the purchaser to believe that the notices were not required to be given pursuant to s. 36.3 of the Act."
296,"The Interspousal Contract states that the specified child support is payable for the two children of the marriage and was calculated under the Guidelines based on Mr. Marzolf’s expected annual income of $110,000.00.","Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999.
The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month.
The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000.
The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley.
The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school.
The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000.
She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls.
HELD: 1)
The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay.
In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return.
The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income.
To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding.
The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years.
The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2)
The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922.
This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources.
It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount.
Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income.
This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376.
However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424.
The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410.
It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003.
This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952.
Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.
 3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345.
It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent.
In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support.
Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.
 4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003.
In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes.
The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003.
Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so.
She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support.
Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.
 5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract.
Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed.
6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted.
No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment.
Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year.
The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7)
In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410.
Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8)
The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600."
297,"3(2) of the Children and Family Services Act: (2) Where person is directed pursuant to this Act, except in respect of proposed adoption, to make an order or determination in the best interests of child, the person shall consider those of the following circumstances that are relevant: (a) the importance for the child’s development of positive relationship with parent or guardian and secure place as member of family; (b) the child’s relationships with relatives; (c) the importance of continuity in the child’s care and the possible effect on the child of the disruption of that continuity; (d) the bonding that exists between the child and the child’s parent or guardian; (e) the child’s physical, mental and emotional needs, and the appropriate care or treatment to meet those needs; (f) the child’s physical, mental and emotional level of development; (g) the child’s cultural, racial and linguistic heritage; (h) the religious faith, if any, in which the child is being raised; (I) the merits of plan for the child’s care proposed by an agency, including proposal that the child be placed for adoption, compared with the merits of the child remaining with or returning to parent or guardian; (j) the child’s views and wishes, if they can be reasonably ascertained; (k) the effect on the child of delay in the disposition of the case; (l) the risk that the child may suffer harm through being removed from, kept away from, returned to or allowed to remain in the care of parent or guardian; (m) the degree of risk, if any, that justified the finding that the child is in need of protective services; (n) any other relevant circumstances.","The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children.
Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard.
The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency.
Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders.
Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed.
Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling"

After show cause hearings, the court refused to release the accused from detention.
The accused apply for a review of the detention orders.
HELD: 1) A review of the detention orders would ordinarily be cursory and the applications dismissed.
The reasons for the decisions to refuse to release the accused cannot seriously be questioned.
2) However, a factor that causes concern is that 6 months after their arrest, not only has a preliminary hearing not been conducted, no date for a preliminary hearing has been set.
No preliminary hearing date will be set before May 2005.
The preliminary hearing will take 2 to 3 weeks.
 It seems unlikely that the trial of these individuals will take place within a year of the date of their arrest.
3) They are ordered released on terms and upon the filing of security in the amount of $1,000."
299,"The only materials considered by the Court in this application are the statement of claim and affidavit of Ms. Scott filed in support of the pre‑judgment garnishee. [13] Of more concern to the Court is the four‑page invoice dated October 31, 2005, attached to Ms. Scott’s affidavit as Exhibit “C”, supposedly attached to confirm the amount of debt owed by the defendant in the amount of $24,155.94.","FIAT: The applicant defendant seeks an order pursuant to s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act setting aside the plaintiff's pre-judgment garnishees in which $2,291.90 was paid into court from the defendant's bank account in December 2005.
The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act.
HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.
 1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons.
2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand.
Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement.
3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant.
The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing.
Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing."
300,[47] am satisfied the judge did not apply wrong principle or make an unjust prder in permitting Mr. Oickle to amend his counterclaim to include claim for an “oppression remedy.” Derivative Action [48] The appellants third ground of appeal is that the judge erred in granting Mr. Oickle leave to commence derivative action for and on behalf of the Company against Mr. Bunnell and Ms. Fraser pursuant to s.,"The plaintiff company commenced an action against a former employee/shareholder for breach of fiduciary and employee duty.
The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company.
The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action.
The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites.
The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required.
The plaintiff company appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies.
The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them."
301,"It was further held that there was no unjust enrichment because there did not exist special relationship between Wacky’s and Joseph. It can be said, however, that in almost all of the cases the facts established that there was special relationship between the parties, frequently contractual at the outset, which relationship would have made it unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit conferred on him by the plaintiff benefit, be it said, that was not conferred ‘officiously’.","The claimant flooring dealer had supplied and installed a large amount of flooring in the defendant's new home.
Although the defendant had visited the claimant's store and selected the flooring, the actual purchase was made by the defendant's contractor who did not pay the claimant and had now declared bankruptcy.
The adjudicator found that although the three criteria for an unjust enrichment claim had been met, there was no special relationship between the parties and thus, denied the claim.
The claimant appealed.
Appeal allowed;
the absence of a special relationship will not automatically defeat a claim of unjust enrichment; the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment claims."
302,[15] The defendant asks the court to conclude from their expert reports that the piece of metal the plaintiff alleges hit her vehicle and caused her injury did not come from the defendant’s vehicle and could not have been dangling from the defendant’s vehicle.,"The plaintiff alleged that a small piece of metal seen dangling from beneath the defendant's tractor trailer flew out from under the trailer as it passed the plaintiff's vehicle and hit her engine hood, bounced in the open window and caused her to lose control of her vehicle.
She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control.
The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled.
Application for summary judgment granted;
the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success.
The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge."
303,"It is therefore arguable, in the case at bar, that, had third party assumed the registered interest of the respondent, that party would have been entitled to assume that the R.M. mortgage charged the unlimited fee simple interest of the mortgagor and was not subject to any unregistered security interest, whether or not such an interest was prior in time or in equity.","This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC.
The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC.
The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act.
HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant.
The appeal is dismissed with costs.
 1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2)
Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered.
In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties.
This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000.
In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000.
The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent.
Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC.
The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act."
304,"They arrived at the hospital at approximately 3:52 a.m. and at approximately 4:03 a.m. Officer Kiesman came to the following conclusions: 1) that based on the fresh tracks in the snow and the accused still in the driver’s seat, the accident had occurred no more than 10 to 15 minutes before his dispatch call of 3:11 a.m.; 2) that based on the accident scene, information received and his observations of the accused, he believed he had reasonable and probable grounds to make demand on the accused; 3) that based on the accused’s condition of being immobilized and “not in any condition to provide any breath samples at this point in time,” and in consultation with Officer Baillargeon, that he should make blood sample demand rather than breath demand.” [15] At 4:03 a.m. he advised the accused he was being charged and read him his rights to counsel and warning from prescribed card.","The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code.
HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis.
Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08.
The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.
 1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch.
The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public.
The Court reviewed the cases.
The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat.
He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene.
Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle.
There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'.
The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle.
2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.
 3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused.
Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand.
In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation.
3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation.
He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief.
The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code.
The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath.
All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private.
After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer.
Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer.
He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests.
Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right.
To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite.
The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way."
305,The issues to which the Federation and the Students’ Union refer in this regard include (a) lack of formal declaration as to when the campaign was to begin; (b) failure to give proper notice of the wording of the referendum question; (c) the evolving nature of the referendum protocol and related failure to properly notify interested parties of changes in the protocol; (d) lack of clarity or agreement about spending limits and classroom campaigning; (e) failure to resolve the inconsistencies between the referendum requirements of the Federation and the Students’ Union prior to the beginning of the campaign; (f) involvement of Federation members of the Oversight Committee in the campaign; (g) the location of polling stations; (h) use of paper ballots rather than online voting; and (i) failure to refer complaints about the referendum results to an appeals committee.,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation).
The referendum was held in the fall of 2005.
A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation.
The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect.
The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order.
They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions.
HELD: The appeals must be dismissed.
1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act.
He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign.
Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation.
The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation.
The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward.
An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary.
There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.
 2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case.
Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct.
The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section.
Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself.
3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum.
Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue.
Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation.
It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process.
The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act."
306,"That case holds that where police officer’s grounds for making demand for sample are as the result of self-incriminating statements of the accused, that have been excluded as they are in breach of section (as they were made under compulsion of statute), the results of the demand must be excluded.","Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.'
The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers.
The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample.
The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood.
During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information.
The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions.
The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand.
The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police.
The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law.
HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case.
The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive.
The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights.
He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act.
He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute.
Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated.
Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements.
The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act.
As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial.
As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights."
307,"[2] This is a decision following a voir dire held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search of R.C. by police, and the admissibility of 17.8 grams of crack cocaine found on the young person. The strip search conducted at the police station later on was not for the purpose of affording evidence related to the stolen vehicle, but it was for the purpose of affording evidence related to the possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking, which itself, was reasonable conclusion to draw, based on the substance of Tuft’s telephone call together with the subsequent arrival of the stolen vehicle near the agreed upon location.","A youth was arrested and charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle after the vehicle arrived near the location of a pre-arranged drug transaction.
The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear.
A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized.
The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive.
There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search.
This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person."
308,"[46] am satisfied that concerns relating to Mr. Crewe’s medical condition and his use of marijuana can be managed to some extent if the children continue to have, as they do in the present varied Corollary Relief Judgment, the right to decide whether or not they will at any given time be driven by their father.","The mother of two boys, ages 12 and 13, applied to vary access to add a condition that the father only be allowed to drive with the boys in the HRM, on roads with a speed limit of 80km/hr and under.
She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation.
The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed.
The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence.
His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use.
An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana.
The unrepresented mother sought costs.
Conditions continued; variation granted.
If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation.
Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800.
In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children.
The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips.
While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother.
If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home.
In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party.
Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work.
She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court."
309,[10] The Appellant appeals the findings of the Adjudicator on the grounds that he committed errors in law in interpreting the relevant sections of the Small Claims Court Act and in his finding that Eastside did not attorn to the Alberta jurisdiction.,"The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract.
The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract.
The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out.
The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court.
The claimant appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment."
310,"[15] Crown counsel, in his turn, also addressed the fact of the inconsistencies in the complainant's testimony, reminding the jury as to the length of time the complainant had been cross-examined at the preliminary inquiry and at trial, and that there had been lapse of time of almost 18 months between the alleged incident and the trial, urging the jury to move past the inconsistencies and decide the two questions in the case which were whether she had been sexually assaulted and assaulted with bat. [16] The danger the trial judge faced in drawing the jury's attention to the inconsistencies would have been the necessity of drawing their attention to that which significantly corroborated D.K.’s testimony: (i) she arrived home with fresh injuries on her face and back and her immediate response was to call 911; (ii) A.Q. corroborated that she was in pain and she was distraught; (iii) the police officer testified to fresh injuries and the extent that she was distraught; (iv) the police received call to attend at the General Hospital at 9:32 p.m., which corroborated the general timeframe of the incidents as stated by the complainant; and (v) the police seized baseball bat from the appellant's home.","The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon.
He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation.
He appeals both conviction and sentence.
The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment.
The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex.
The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'.
Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face.
As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat.
The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies.
HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed.
The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court.
While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case.
There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial.
Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence.
The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case.
Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted.
The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels.
Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment.
After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada.
If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order.
The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal."
311,"[14] On the same date, July 24, 2007, Mr. Morrison told Mr. Postnikoff, on the BASF matter, that he was prepared to write off legal fees of $1,800.00, which would reduce that account to $7,000.00. [17] Neither side contacted the other after this time, until December 6, 2007, when Mr. Morrison sent letter to Mr. Postnikoff informing him that the period to apply for taxation (assessment) of his accounts had expired.","Applicant seeks an order for an assessment of his legal bill.
A Registrar may assess any bill for legal services, provided that the application is filed within 30 days or more if a judge makes a discretionary order to extend the period for assessment if it is in the interests of justice to do so.
The issue if whether the applicant's two bills fall with the said 30 days or if this is a case where it is appropriate to abridge the time for allowing an assessment.
HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment.
The bills were issued in two separate matters.
In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue.
There will be no extension of time for the first bill.
The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it.
He was advised that the bill would be adjusted.
An initial adjustment was made and when still not satisfied, ongoing discussions about the bill continued.
The Court held that the last document received by the applicant was not the final bill as it was still subject to change.
In this case, the lawyer has been paid from monies held in trust for the client, the time being abridged is relatively short and neither party has alleged that any prejudice would result."
312,"[31] In the Janvier case, the Court of Appeal concluded that the arresting officer did not find Mr. Janvier committing the offense (see paragraph 29) and viewed the officer’s basis for arrest as nothing more than “suspicion.” [32] The Crown argues that the Janvier decision can be distinguished on four bases: (a) It relates to situation where the smell of burned marihuana alone was relied upon and where the officer had no special knowledge or training; (b) In Janvier, there were other possible explanations for the smell of cannabis marihuana in the truck, other than Mr. Janvier having been smoking cannabis marihuana whereas, in the present case, Mr. Stone was the only source of the odor of cannabis; (c) In the present case, the officer’s evidence regarding the smell of cannabis marihuana is bolstered by Mr. Stone’s admission of recent possession and consumption of cannabis, supported by the officer’s observation of Mr. Stone’s symptoms consistent with recent consumption; and (d) In the present case, the time and place of the accused’s prior smoking of cannabis marihuana and the fact that he was pending on drug possession charge provide additional grounds for believing that the accused was in possession of un-smoked cannabis marihuana.","The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation.
Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana.
When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse.
He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him.
After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment.
The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.
He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs.
Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon.
The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search.
He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights.
Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied.
The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached.
While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary.
Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning.
After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case.
Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable.
The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana.
The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge.
Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful.
The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable.
In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation."
313,Their finding of guilt in relation to Mr. Johnston on the charge of attempting to murder Vantino Beals signifies that they accepted from the evidence of Vantino Beals and Lisa Dudka that the Crown had established beyond reasonable doubt that Jerrell Johnston was the man Lisa Dudka said she saw firing gun at person whom she saw running from the driveway at 443 Upper Partridge River Road and who Vantino Beals said was the man who fired gun at him.,"The defendant was found guilty of attempted murder after he used a handgun to shoot the complainant outside a bar.
He had a previous record for non-violent offences.,
defendant sentenced to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment;
aggravating factors included the defendant's possession and use of a handgun in an area where a number of people were close by and that a bullet had found its way into a nearby residence."
314,"Tax Heard: January 22, 2010, February 5, 2010 and February 12, 2010, in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia Oral decision: February 12, 2010 Charges: Section 17(1) and 74(1)(a) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act Counsel: Peter Craig, for the Crown Donald Murray, Q.C., for the Defence By the Court: Introduction: [1] The decision for the Court to render today is to determine fit and proper sentence for Mr. Eric Eagles.","The on-site supervisor was convicted of two offences under the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter of the work area and failing to ensure that an intermediate or 'mid' guardrail was installed) after a mason was killed when he fell from scaffolding on the job site.
Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell.
The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew.
In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations.
The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard.
This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard.
Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall."
315,"MacLellan, for the respondent Decision: [1] On May 5, 2011, Mr. MacDonald applied in Chambers for interim release (bail) pending appeal of his conviction for offences relating to careless use and unlawful possession of a weapon.","The defendant, who was found guilty of the careless use of a firearm, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace and possession of a restricted or prohibited firearm applied for bail pending appeal.
He had been found, in his residence, with a firearm licensed in Alberta but not licensed to be brought into this province or possessed here.
The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work.
Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction.
Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions.
The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations."
316,"271(1)(a) Counsel: Christopher Nicholson, for the Crown Donald Murray, for the Defense By the Court: [1] This is an Application by the accused to set aside his guilty plea to count # 1, the sexual assault of his son. The Defense position is that Mr. Pavey participated in concluding plea and sentence negotiation and the entering of guilty plea knowing that the accused denied that he committed the act of sexual assault as alleged or any other sexual assault.","The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea.
He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son.
The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography.
Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed;
the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault.
The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation."
317,"[12] In connection with Mr. Hand's alternative claim for party and party costs, am referred to Re. Harmer, 1963 CanLII 143 (ON SC), [1963] O.J. 778 (H.C.J.), motion for directions; Champ Estate, [1986] S.J. 277 (Q.B.), testator's family maintenance; Ramsay Estate, [2004] N.S.J. 375, testimony capacity, and; Wamboldt v.","A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death.
His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death.
Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate.
In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister.
The parties will bear their own costs.
There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs.
Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded.
As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here.
The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid.
The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation?
In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them."
318,"Nor did he apply to the Court of Queen’s Bench for new trial on the basis his counsel was incompetent, or make formal application to adduce fresh evidence.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving and alleged that his estranged wife and daughter lied.
The appellant had been represented at trial by experienced counsel but undertook the appeals himself.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
The appellant had not followed procedures that must be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence."
319,"[2] had also directed the Crown to inform Robert Lowenberger and Kelly Charbonneau that an order for disclosure had been made and invited all of the parties to make further submissions in writing with regard to the second stage of the O’Connor disclosure process, especially with regard to any conditions for release of any documents or the information they contain. 42] DECISION [8] Having reviewed the records, and upon considering all of the factors referred to in the above-noted jurisprudence, I have decided to produce all 95 pages of documents to counsel for both of the accused, Ronald Devin Zerr and Ashton Joseph James Lavallee.","The accused was charged with second degree murder and two counts of aggravated assault.
The accused made an O'Connor application for third party records relating to the two surviving Crown witnesses.
In particular, the accused sought disclosure of police reports, videotaped evidence, witness statements, warned statements regarding the multiple arrests and charges incurred by the victims and disclosure of their criminal records.
In 2012 SKQB 543, the Court ordered production of the records.
This decision deals with whether the documents should be produced to the accused.
HELD: The documents were disclosed to the accused.
The judge vetted the documents to black out words, phrases or numbers that have no probative value or where the privacy interest of the witness would have been unjustifiably affected."
320,"As result, Gardon Securities installed temperature monitoring equipment in the cooler and freezer of Sturgis Meats in January 2006, for the sum of $1,190.26 (Exhibit P-1), and then monitored the temperature in the freezer and cooler of this business thereafter.","The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the installation and monitoring of temperature monitoring equipment for its meat cutting business.
The defendant monitored the temperature in the freezer and cooler at the business.
The plaintiffs sued because their freezer failed and meat spoiled after a circuit breaker at the business tripped off.
The defendant had received no alarm.
The plaintiff asserts that the defendant breached the contract by failing to properly monitor the temperature in the freezer.
HELD: The contract between the parties was solely for installation and monitoring.
The contract did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the equipment at the plaintiff's business.
The Court was satisfied that the defendant was monitoring the signal from the plaintiff's business on the dates in question and no alarm was received.
It is not possible to say with any certainty why the defendant did not receive an alarm, but the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff was regularly having its monitoring equipment serviced or repaired.
The plaintiff has not proven that the defendant breached the contract.
The action is dismissed."
321,"In the end, the trial judge concluded that the accused was not given reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice (transcript, p. 153, lines 12 to 24): As such, conclude that the accused was not given reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice. 156, lines to 5): In conclusion, on balancing all factors, particularly the ease that the (inaudible) [sic] comply with section 10(b), and particularly in this case, no access to material to choose lawyer, and the constable’s, find, unreasonable effort at locating the requested lawyer, as such have concluded that the exclusion of the certificate, and any evidence as to breath samples given by the accused, all being subsequent to the Charter 10(b) breach is the proper remedy, and that the administration and the exclusion of such would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute, and it would cause that if the evidence was admitted.","The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.
After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges.
The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.
The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety.
There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop.
The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device.
The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer.
At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood.
A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings.
A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them.
The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused.
The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook.
The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one.
The accused did not recall this waiver.
The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty.
The accused's readings were .11 and .04.
The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results.
HELD: The appeal was not successful.
Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness.
There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b).
The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice.
The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure.
The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned.
The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective.
The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached.
The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside."
322,"Since she had filed her notice of appeal and application before reasons were made available in O’Connor Garden, 2014 SKCA 90 (CanLII) (where Whitmore J.A., in chambers, dealt with an application for leave to appeal from decision not to vacate certificate of pending litigation), she elected to seek leave to appeal and, with no objection from counsel for the respondent, her application proceeded on that basis alone, with her notice of appeal deemed to be “draft” notice of appeal.","Civil Procedure – Appeal – Leave to AppealLand – Certificate of Pending Litigation
The appellant sought leave to appeal the chambers decision not to vacate the certificate of pending litigation registered on behalf of her estranged husband, who was deceased.
The respondent’s solicitors filed the certificate of pending litigation after his death.
The appellant transferred the land subject to the certificate of pending litigation into her name only and entered into an agreement to sell the land, which could not proceed with the certificate of pending litigation.
HELD: The appeal was of sufficient merit and it was not prima facie frivolous or vexatious.
The appeal, however, was not found to be of sufficient importance to the practice of law or the Court of Queen’s Bench to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal.
There was no new, controversial or unusual issue of practice raised by the appeal.
The issues were determined to be better left for resolution by the Court of Queen’s Bench after hearing vive voce evidence at trial."
323,"The Defence sought ruling that the information to obtain the search warrant (hereafter referred to as ‘the ITO’) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing section of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and that evidence obtained should be excluded.","Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code.
The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son.
The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband.
The parties were separated.
The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child.
After this RCMP were contacted.
On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained.
During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it.
They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach.
Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded.
The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography.
The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO.
The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above.
However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”.
When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home.
She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house.
She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle.
During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures.
He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs.
Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant.
Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included.
The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence.
The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her.
The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction.
The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources.
The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model.
The purpose of including the information was not made clear.
The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore.
The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused.
Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him.
The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?
 HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided.
The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded.
The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant.
The impact of the breach on the accused was serious.
Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well.
The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest.
The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case."
324,"Whatever the reason, Cst. Schmidt neither advised Ms. Drake of the availability of Legal Aid duty counsel nor did he provide Prosper warning. For reasons unexplained at trial, Cst. Schmidt did not provide Prosper warning after Ms. Drake’s second unsuccessful attempt to contact legal counsel.","Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal
The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights.
The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving.
The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft.
He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech.
She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol.
When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath.
He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still.
She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance.
When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five.
He arrested her and made the breath demand.
The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things.
With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested.
At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it.
A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received.
The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample.
The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer.
The officer called the number but received an after-hours message.
He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message.
She then provided her first breath sample.
The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.
 HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach.
The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired;
and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b).
The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message."

In 2012, after a trial, it was determined that the child should be parented on a shared basis with a one-week rotation between parents.
An order was never issued and therefore, no judgment was taken out.
The applicant now applied to have a formal judgment issued, and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence.
Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report.
The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time.
The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour.
The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure.
She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy.
HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report.
It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report.
There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time.
The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old.
He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court.
The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program.

326,"[47] Following are the reasons why the court finds that Mr. Petrie and Mr. Ziola failed to reach an adequate consensus ad idem respecting the sale of the Subject Quarters during the first telephone conversation on December 12, 2014.","Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract
The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages.
The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land.
The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds.
The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow.
The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation.
Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present.
The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action.
The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed.
The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter).
In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters).
The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program.
He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced.
After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders.
They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals.
The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters.
The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000.
At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000.
The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”.
He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters.
The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters.
He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers.
The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters.
The defendant told him to “hold off”.
The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters.
The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters.
Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid.
The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.
 HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed.
He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters.
The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract.
In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties.
The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding.
Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things;
and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract."

The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases.
The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale.
The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata.
As at November 1, 2017, the principal and interest owing on the non-purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,250.
The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment.
It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage.
The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro rata calculation for the nonpurchase portion of the mortgage, that is, 8 percent of the total costs incurred.
 HELD: The application was granted.
The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to a deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested.
It was also entitled to judgment against the mortgagee for eight percent of the solicitor-client costs, condominium fees and property management charges."
328,"Since‑ the first and most essential question was whether or not the Charter applied to these parties, counsel was requested to file further briefs on this particular question, as well as whether the effect of the Snider decision applies retroactively to these particular applicants and, finally whether jurisdiction should be assumed in view of the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act and the complaints of the applicants currently before the Human Rights Commission.","This was an application under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the two appellant university professors was invalid and denied the rights of the appellants as guaranteed under ss. 15(1) and (7) of the Charter, and an order for reinstatement and back pay.
Dismissing the application,
that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission.
The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint.
The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force."

The message centre was never activated, although the equipment was in place at the defendant's warehouse.
Dismissing the claim for breach of contract and allowing the unjust enrichment claim,

In her evidence at trial, K.T. seemed to retract her admissions in the apology that the allegations in the Reports were true, by repeating, like broken record, ""I believed what my children told me."" The whole long history of K.T.\'s attempts in and out of court to discredit R.G.H. and W.G.H. so that K.T. could have the children live with her and restrict access to R.G.H., is extrinsic evidence of ""impure motive"" or, in other words, ""malice"".","Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless.
The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse.
At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports.
HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000.
Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.
 1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication.
It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports.
3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.
 4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling.
Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice.
The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice.
The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause.
5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors.
This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act.
Three reports were slanderous.
7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed.
8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive.
9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents.

The trial judge, after advising counsel, over Mr. Ryan's objection, that he would leave both the issue of mental distress damages and punitive damages to the jury and that he would ask the jury why such awards were made if the jury found Ms. Killorn entitled to such damages, stated to counsel: ""So in this case then, do not since we have the two questions asking them to briefly describe the conduct.","The respondent was hired as an account manager by the appellant.

She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor.
When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job.
She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed.
The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress.
The appellant appealed the award for mental distress.
Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal,
that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice.
Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment.
However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises."

The other requirement of Section 50(3) is that the defendant “shall not make the turn until he has afforded reasonable opportunity to the driver of the approaching vehicle to avoid collision”.","A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act.
The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second.
Two passengers were knocked unconscious.
One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head.
HELD: The defendant was found not guilty.
His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances.
The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield.
The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision.
It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.
 1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3).
The right of way, however, is not absolute.
As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor.
It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on.
Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor.
Alcohol was not a factor.
Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights.
3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard."

He sought a declaration that a member of the police service must be informed of any investigation of his conduct prior to the commencement of the investigation as required by s.54 of the Police Act.; the Act does not permit the amendment in Form A discipline notice since it is a statutory form.
The relief sought regarding disclosure had been abandoned by the applicant.
The applicant argued that the fundamental questions to be addressed revolved around issues of statutory interpretation that must be resolved on a standard of correctness and the alternative remedies were not adequate.
The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
There is an adequate alternative remedy which should be pursued.
There were no 'special circumstances' upon which the court should exercise its discretion to determine the merits of the application."

[18] The plaintiff therefore remains entitled to notice to March 31, 1999, at her salary at the time of termination including the medical expenses which would have been covered during that period under the medical plan of the defendant, but without including bonuses or extra payments for sick pay.","The plaintiff who had been employed by the defendant's predecessor for 23 years as office manager and bookkeeper until 1997, brought an action for damages against her new employers for dismissal without adequate notice.
The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998.
The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules.
HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period.
Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause.
Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time.
Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year.
She remained entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at the time of termination and to medical expenses that would have been covered but without bonuses or extra payments for sick pay.
2)The defendant did not establish the plaintiff ought to have done more to mitigate her loss.
There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.
 3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment.
Amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant were to be deducted.
4)The plaintiff was entitled to interest in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act.
5)The defendant could make no deduction for insurance benefit payments.
Sections 45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act was drawn to their attention. 6)The plaintiff was awarded costs.
Fees were to be taxed on column 2. 7)The plaintiff was to deliver a copy of the calculation of the judgment.
Either could issue judgment with the other's consent as to form and content.
An application for further directions could be made."
343,"Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, 1980 CanLII 21 (SCC), [1980] S.C.R. 735, in which it stated that the court should only strike out statement of claim ""in plain and obvious cases and where the court is satisfied that the case is beyond doubt"". On that basis alone I am satisfied that the defendants have an arguable case and that the third party claim discloses a reasonable cause of action.","An application to strike out the third party claim as not disclosing a reasonable cause of action.
The plaintiffs brought a claim in contract and tort alleging Hagblom caused a fire in their building.
The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation.
The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence.
In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
Leave was granted nunc pro tunc to bring third party proceedings.
(1)The third party claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action.
It was not plain and obvious the claim could not succeed.
It was arguable on the pleadings that the third parties did not act in good faith in that it was alleged they deliberately set out to suppress information and destroy evidence.
(2)The statutory limitations will not nullify the third party claim if the allegations relevant to the contention that the third parties did not act in good faith are proven."
344,"April 26, 2000 This application under Section 2 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act requires consideration of the following points in relation to the provisions of Act; 1) The purpose of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act as set out in Section of the Act. 2) The motion materials filed by the applicant are deficient and ought to a least include; a) copy of the notices of intention with proper proofs of service.","This application under s.2 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act (SFSA) requires the Court to consider a number of points in relation to the act.
The applicant's materials are deficient.
Several necessary documents must be filed.
In addition, the Farm Land Security Board has not completed its mandatory tasks under the Act.
HELD: Application adjourned and leave is given to each party to file further materials.
The Farm Land Security Board is requested to provide its report to the Court.
Ordinarily, the deficiency in the applicant's motion might merit dismissal, but the Act would then give the respondent a 1 year grace period.
This result is unwarranted given that the scheme of the legislation is to encourage discussions between debtor and creditor and the respondent has refused to discuss mortgage issues.
Further, the respondent's refusal to provide information should not be allowed to derail the process of financial review by the Farm Land Security Board.
No costs to any party."
345,"May 5, 2000 [1] This is an appeal from a decision of the Deputy Rentalsman ordering the landlord, Bradley Calvin Dafoe/Formula 1 Real Estate Service/Al Fuchs, to pay the sum of $3,414.50 to the respondent, Danna Koethler. The Rentalsman’s order incorrectly includes and orders the appellant, representative of the landlord to be jointly financially responsible for this award.","An appeal from a decision of the Deputy Rentalsman ordering the landlord to pay $3,414.50 to the tenant.
In issue was the jurisdiction of the Deputy Rentalsman to impose an award on the appellant who was acting as a representative for the landlord and not in his own right and who had not received notice that he was to be a named party at a hearing where an award could be made against him and who was unable to prepare and present a defence on his own behalf.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
1)The material clearly showed the appellant received notice that he was named as a party and in fact was the only party named as landlord.
An itemized list of the damages claimed was attached to the notice.
There was nothing to indicate he was unable to prepare and present a defence.
2)There was no error of law.
The definition contained in s.2(d)(ii) was considered in Lachance v. Auzano Asset which held s.2(d)(ii) was determinative of the issue.
The Act is intended to provide an informal and efficient procedure for determining landlord and tenant disputes.
This goal is facilitated by permitting such individuals as property managers to assume the role and status of landlords (Lachance)."
346,"[30] Applicants’ counsel submit that as the information used to obtain the video surveillance warrant consists entirely of excerpts from the intercepted conversations obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance authorization, the video surveillance warrant should also be set aside, on the basis there is no other information submitted in the affidavit in support of the warrant that could provide reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance. [46] Counsel for the applicant submits that much of the information used to establish reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrants consisted of intercepted communications pursuant to an authorization that has since been set aside, and for this reason the search warrant should also be set aside and the evidence consisting mainly of the marihuana plants seized at the Derksen residence should be excluded from evidence at trial.","FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.
 They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter.
The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization.
As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with.
The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry.
The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information.
HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed.
The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial.
The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside.
The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure.
The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.
 2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence.
It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates.
4)The 1997 authorization was set aside.
The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter.
The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met.
There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed.
The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading.
The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch.
The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved.
Neither had a criminal record.
The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.
 5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization.
A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization.
The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant.
The privacy interest was comparatively high.
The nature of the constitutional breach was major.
The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis.
6)The residence search warrant was set aside.
The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge.
The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information.
The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable.
7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale.
There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met.
While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith.
On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.
 8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant.
The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter.
A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants.
The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras.
The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast.
The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along.
It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid.
The two events did not amount to a course of conduct.
9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial."
347,"As preliminary issue, the defendant asserts, that, even if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay in lieu of time off, the plaintiff should be considered to have waived this entitlement by his conduct over the years. To meet this burden, the defendant claims that the plaintiff’s monthly wage contained component of holiday pay and that the plaintiff’s total employment package exceeded the LSA standard.","A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice.
The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs.
The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay.
HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.
 1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays.
The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA.
Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement.
Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date.
Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose.
4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax.
As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.
 5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year.
The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.
 6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus.
The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor.
The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent.
Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period.
The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose.
It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA.
Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime.
Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime.
The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays."
348,"v. Oakman, [1993] M.J. No. 236 (Man. Q.B.) after careful review of the authorities the Court stated at page 28: ""If the Crown is to be allowed to rely upon the results of breathalyzer test to convince court to convict person accused of driving motor vehicle while the volume of alcohol in that person's blood exceeded 80 milligrams percent, the accused must certainly be able to fully question and challenge the results of the test. However, the police are not required to ascertain such information by posing the question to the suspect prior to administering the screening device test."" [75] The arresting officer who has no reason to believe that an Accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes may administer the roadside screening test without delay but to do so carries with it certain risk that there may subsequently be evidence of consumption which will invalidate the results.","The accused was charged with impaired driving (Criminal Code ss.255(1) and 253(a)) and with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08 (Criminal Code ss.253(b) and 255(1)).
Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary?
HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08).
Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.
 1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed.
The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial.
4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case.
In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded.
It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence.
It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.
 5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings.
Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded.
6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test.
Both the subjective and objective tests were met.
The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test).
Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes.
However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence.
The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle.
While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied.
There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel.
He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver.
Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable.
It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city.
The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there.
It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant.
On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied.
There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected.
The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code."
349,"All cooperating brokers are compensated from this commission."" [35] On November 24, 1997 Mr. Murphy wrote Mr. Walters stating: ""Dear Tony want to thank you for taking the time to meet with Deirdre and Robert the other day.","The plaintiff and defendant entered into an oral contract for the development and sale of land.
The plaintiff brought an action to recover its commission on the contract.
Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done.
Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable.
An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties."
350,"D. Miller a court expert and refusing to order Dr. Miller to answer certain interrogatories, the majority of which call for his opinion concerning the medical services provided by the respondent, another physician, to the appellant.","The plaintiff appealed an interlocutory decision in which the chambers judge held that a non-party medical doctor who had provided emergency treatment to the plaintiff did not have to answer certain interrogatories on the basis that they required an opinion.
The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial.
Appeal allowed in part;
the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given.
Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided.
However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided.
Interrogatories cannot be used to usurp the Rules surrounding the use of expert evidence."
351,"The application was also for directions as to procedure to govern the future course of conduct of trial, in the alternative to determination of the question of law and, secondly, to dismiss the action because Nova Scotia is a forum non conveniens.","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident in Quebec and commenced an action in Nova Scotia.
The applicant applied to determine whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia concerning the Quebec accident and to dismiss the action on the basis that Nova Scotia was a forum non conveniens.
Application to dismiss the action dismissed; the forum conveniens is Nova Scotia.
The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens.
In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens.
The substantive law governing the proceeding will be the law of the place where the accident occurred and the governing procedural law will be the law of the place of the trial."
352,"[6] It is unclear what occurred leading up to the August 19 to August 26 visit, other than that the father’s lawyer wrote to the mother’s lawyer on August 19 saying access had been denied and asking the mother to transport the child to Regina so the father could have him for the remainder of the week, which he had taken off work. [8] On the next visit, September 10, 2002, with the added impetus of an order specifically directing the Saskatoon City Police to locate the child and assist the father in exercising access, the mother carried the fussing child to the father’s car.","FIAT. The father applied to have the mother cited for contempt for denial of access.
Custody was transferred to the father by fiat October 4, 2002 and the mother was directed to give viva voce evidence.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
Discretion was exercised under Queen's Bench Act to direct the parents to complete the parent education program and file the certificate of completion within 60 days.
Counsel were to explore the possibility of conducting exchanges through the supervised exchange program.
Contempt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
Neither fine nor imprisonment should be ordered unless consistent with the best interests of the child.
A finding of contempt is usually considered the ultimate sanction and thus the remedy of last resort.
Costs in the cause."
353,It is clear from the comments of the trial judge that he did not accept the appellant’s testimony when he stated that he did not cause injuries in forcing the complainant’s return to the truck.,"The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity.
The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed.
The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered.
1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law.
No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.
 2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why.
It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility.
Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault.
Again no miscarriage of justice resulted.
3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity.
The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided.
The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality.
The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant.
It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal.
Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion."
354,"January 7, 2003 [1] The applicant seeks the following relief:    (a) A declaration that the charges against the applicant cannot constitute professional misconduct without contravening provisions of the Charter and The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code;  (b) An order of prohibition to prohibit the discipline committee of the Saskatchewan Association of Licensed Practical Nurses (“SAPLN” or the Association”) from hearing the said charges;  (c) A declaration that the charges are res judicata;  (d) A request for an order for particulars;  (d) Costs.","The applicant sought a declaration that the charges against her could not constitute professional misconduct without contravening the Charter and Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; an order of prohibition to prevent the SAPLN discipline committee or Association from hearing the charges; a declaration that the charges are res judicata; an order for particulars; costs.
HELD: The application was dismissed in its entirety with taxed costs to SAPLN.
 1)No order for further particulars was made at this time.
The Hearing Notice particularizes the factual allegations and is specific as to time and their nature. 2)The only matter previously considered by the discipline committee dealt with whether there was any professional misconduct established arising out of criminal convictions for illegal picketing prior to the applicant becoming a member of SALPN.
3)The Act provides an adequate alternate remedy, which should be pursued.
There were no special circumstances upon which the court could exercise its discretion to determine the merits of this application or to provide the relief sought."
355,"Whether prior consultation with the public trustee takes place or not, the onus is on person making an application for property guardianship without the necessity of bond to persuade the court that it is appropriate, bearing in mind the object of the legislation which is to ensure that the adult’s estate will not be dissipated during the guardianship, or if it is, that it may be restored.","FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's.
Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond.
This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001.
Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc.
The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000.
Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate.
HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted.
No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship.
The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4).
Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment.
The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate.
Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not.
To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1)."

1) No error was demonstrated.
2) This Court has signalled its reluctance to interfere with the discretion of a chambers judge when dealing with matters of this nature."
358,"THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2004 SKCA 37 Date: 20040315 Between: Docket: 783 [R.J.E.] (Petitioner) Appellant [H.M.E.] (Respondent) Respondent Coram: Tallis, Cameron Lane JJ.A. Counsel: James A. Phillips for the Respondent Appeal: From: FLD 23 of 1999, J.C. of Moose Jaw Heard: March 15, 2004 Disposition: Dismissed (orally) Written Reasons: March 16, 2004 By: The Honourable Mr. Justice Tallis In Concurrence: The Honourable Mr. Justice Cameron The Honourable Mr. Justice Lane TALLIS J.A.","Fulltext of judgment follows:[1]
We do not need to hear from counsel for the respondent.
I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2]
We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith.
As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly.
[3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'.
Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue.
And in our view he addressed it as required by law.
[4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence.
Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'.
He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them.
[5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5.
[6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access.
The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise.
The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child."
359,"(1) In any proceedings under subsection 255(1) in respect of an offence committed under section 253 or in any proceedings under subsection 255(2) or (3), (g) where samples of the breath of the accused have been taken pursuant to demand made under subsection 254(3), certificate of qualified technician stating (i) that the analysis of each of the samples has been made by means of an approved instrument operated by the technician and ascertained by the technician to be in proper working order by means of an alcohol standard, identified in the certificate, that is suitable for use with an approved instrument, ......... is evidence of the facts alleged in the certificate without proof of the signature or the official character of the person appearing to have signed the certificate; The legislation requires that the alcohol standard be identified in the certificate, but does not state that the approved instrument needs to be so identified.","The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08.
The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level.
The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'.
There was no symbol with it.
In the blank that followed was written '5000C'.
This change was not initialed.
The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model.
HELD: The charge was dismissed.
The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level.
1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.
 2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration.
The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown.
If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly.
In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model."
360,"[20] In summary, the trial judge erred by granting the motion for directed verdict based on the discrepancy between the date of the offences alleged in the Information and the evidence presented at trial because the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences.","Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information.
The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences.
Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict.
The Crown appealed.
Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered.
The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences.
If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal."
361,[10] The reason for referral was stated as follows: Greg Patterson and Taura Publicover have been unable to develop workable co-parenting arrangement and understanding that takes into account their distinctive perspectives and parenting styles as they respond to the needs of their children. [19] conclude it is in these children’s best interests to forthwith implement all recommendations of the Court ordered assessment.,"Pursuant to the Corollary Relief Judgment, the parents had been equally sharing the parenting time of their two children for four years.
The father now applied for interim sole custody, alleging that the ongoing extreme conflict between the parties was adversely affecting the children.
An assessment recommended that the children live with the father and have access with the mother.
Father granted interim sole care, custody and control of the children.
The serious concerns raised by the assessment satisfied the threshold requirement of a material change in circumstances; the urgency of the concerns required immediate action."
362,[5] After the order the parties agreed that weekly access would be changed to Wednesdays and Fridays from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. They also agreed in the latter part of 2004 that Harley would take Keeler to daycare each morning that Charlene worked and also pick him up because Charlene did not get home from work until 6:30 p.m.,"The parties separated in October 2003.
They have a child born May 27, 2002.
The parties have agreed to an order of joint custody with the child residing primarily with the petitioner.
The petitioner wishes to move from Saskatoon to Edmonton.
HELD: Based on the loss of the respondent as an active co-parent and the petitioner's vague and uncertain plans for the child's care in Edmonton, it is not in the best interests of the child that he be allowed to relocate to Edmonton with the petitioner."
363,"Rule 5(2) then specifically addressed amendments sought “after any relevant period of limitation current at the date of issue of the writ had expired and referred to the specific circumstances set out in Rules 5(3), (4) and (5), that is, to amendments to correct name, to alter the capacity of party and to substitute new cause of action if it arises out of the same (or substantially the same) facts as the original claim. One of the issues in Brickfield was whether the Court had the power to grant an amendment under Order 20, Rule 5(1) even though limitation period had expired and the case did not fall within the specific provisions of Rule 5(2) (5).","Six years after the action was commenced, the plaintiff applied to add the defendant's Section D insurer in order to add a cause of action against an unidentified driver.
The limitation period for suing under Section D had expired and no notice of the application had been given to the insurer.
The chambers judge held that he had no discretion to grant the amendment and dismissed the application.
The plaintiff appealed.
Appeal allowed; the plaintiff is entitled to renew the application for the amendment in Supreme Court chambers on notice to the proposed, as well as the existing, defendant within sixty days of today's date; if not filed within that time, the application to add the insurer will be deemed to have been abandoned.
The court had a discretion to grant the amendment even though the case did not fall within any of the specific situations set out in Rule 15.02 as the broad power to amend conferred by Rule 15 is not limited to the specific instances set out the Rule.
Although there was no firm rule that notice to a proposed defendant was necessary in all such applications, generally the applicant should give notice to the proposed defendant (as well as the existing parties) where it is apparent from the circumstances that the proposed defendant likely has a reasonable basis to oppose being joined, such as being prejudiced in its defence by the plaintiff's long delay in asserting his claim."
364,"4. At the January 9, 2004 meeting Mr. Nidesh and explained to our clients that the standard version of the Collaborative Contract required their lawyers to withdraw if matters were not resolved and the parties had to proceed to court. Collaborative Law Contract was signed by us dated January 9th, 2004, and have been advised, copy was filed as Exhibit “A” to the Affidavit of Michael George Therrien, sworn February 20th, 2006 in this matter.","FIAT: The respondent brings an application for a court order requiring Reginald Sauer to withdraw as solicitor for the petitioner.
The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged by the respondent that confidential information was shared.
The respondent also relies on the provisions of the collaborative law agreement signed by the parties.
HELD: 1) The conflict in the facts was apparent and was not resolved by additional evidence.
2) Mr. Sauer agreed to withdraw as counsel so the parties may proceed to pre-trial and a trial without the necessity of a viva voce hearing."
365,"[12] The probate court judge stated that he had “no doubt, after hearing that evidence [of Odette Deveau], that it was joint account with the right of survivorship.” He also found “on the strong balance of probabilities,” that the late Mrs. Scott intended to make an inter vivos gift to Ms. Akerley.","At the time of the deceased's death, she held a bank account jointly with her daughter.
Although the signature card signed when the account was opened could not be found for the hearing, the probate court relied on the evidence of the bank representative (who testified that she had the card when she closed the account and she was 100% sure that the account was a joint account and who was able to present to the court the form of the applicable account agreement) in determining that the monies in the joint account belonged to the daughter.
 It was also found, on a strong balance of probabilities, that the deceased intended to make an inter vivos gift to her daughter and, alternatively, that the evidence rebutted any presumption of resulting trust in favour of the deceased or her estate.
Another of the deceased's children appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
the probate court judge did not misapprehend the evidence, lack an evidentiary basis for his findings, rely upon incorrect legal principles or fail to apply or misapply the law."
366,"Disclosure was not forthcoming until November 2006; [b] omitted to make any reference to the extensive child protection concerns involving B.R.W. in any Agency affidavit filed after January 23, 2006 including the February supplemental affidavit purportedly filed by Ms. MacNeil to provide the court with relevant information which she had inadvertently omitted to record in her first affidavit; [c] omitted to make any reference to the extensive child protection concerns involving B.R.W. in the February 8, 2006 risk conference minutes despite the fact that these concerns were addressed during the conference; [d] omitted to make any reference to the extensive child protection concerns involving B.R.W. in the Agency’s Plans; [e] omitted to make any reference to the extensive child protection concerns involving B.R.W. during any of the court appearances prior to November 2006; [f] omitted to make any reference to the child protection concerns involving T.B. and the children which were observed by Ms. MacNeil prior to the children leaving for Alberta in any affidavit, risk conference minutes, Agency plan, or at any court appearance prior to November 2006; [g] omitted to make any reference, in the Agency Plan of August 2006 that K.B. had stopped residing with T.B. as of April 2006 and that C.B. had been living with people other than T.B. prior to leaving T.B.’s residence for final time in September 2006.","Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies.
Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history.
There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down.
The mother now sought the return of both children.
The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect.
Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation.
Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency.
Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately.
The mother continued to require professional intervention."
367,"(in Chambers) Counsel: Arlene Chuck Lowery on their own behalf Ryan Hrechka for Erick Gordon Sarah Longman Heather Jensen for Ivan Thomson Kenneth Staroszik, Q.C., for Aboriginal Healing Foundation Application: From: Q.B.G. 1005 of 2002, J.C. of Regina Heard: February 14, 2007 Disposition: Application for leave to appeal denied (orally) Written Reasons: February 15, 2007 By: The Honourable Mr. Justice Vancise Vancise J.A.","The applicants apply for leave to appeal a decision wherein the Court denied the applicants leave to add the Aboriginal Healing Foundation as a defendant and denying the applicants leave to amend the statement of claim by inserting the document entitled 'Addendum to the Original Statement of Claim in Support of the Notice of Motion to Amend the above Claim'.
HELD: Application for leave to appeal is denied orally.
In any application to add a party as a defendant, the Court must first decide whether there is a prima facie and meritorious claim disclosed in the amending pleading.
The onus lies on the plaintiffs to establish on the balance of probabilities that they have a reasonable possibility of establishing a claim against the party they seek to add.
They must establish at a minimum the possibility of a cause of action.
That does not exist here and leave is denied.
Similarly with respect to the application to add the addendum to the statement of claim, there was no error in refusing the application to amend the statement of claim."
368,notice to lapse caveat was registered on the subject land’s certificate of title and the prescribed notice was mailed by the Registrar pursuant to s.,"FIAT: A caveat registered to the applicant was removed as a result of the notice to lapse procedure.
The caveat purported to be based upon a right to receive royalties from all gas, carbon and oil produced from the land.
The applicant denied having ever received the notice to lapse.
The applicant sought: 1) retroactive reinstatement of the caveat by order of the Court; and 2) an inquiry by the Court as to whether or not the caveat was removed improperly.
The respondent companies that acquired an interest in the subject land subsequent to the caveat being removed opposed the application based, among other things, on the principle of indefeasibility of title, as did the Registrar of Land Titles.
HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents.
1) Even if the caveat was removed improperly, the Court ought not to retroactively reinstate it, because to do so would defeat the fundamental principle of indefeasibility of title that has been continued in The Land Titles Act, 2000; and 2) it would not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief.
The process, if the applicants chose to pursue it, would be an action under Part XII of the Act."
369,"[33] In her decision, the trial judge noted, accurately, that Dr. Menzies felt that “while Mr. Jobb’s responses indicated basic knowledge of number of the issues addressed in fitness, he expressed concern about the degree to which Mr. Jobb could take-in the information conveyed in court and provide counsel with instruction in response” (para. (3d) 149 (Que. C.A.) which required that the accused be able to “communicate with counsel, converse with counsel rationally or make critical decisions on counsel’s advice.” [40] The approach of the trial judge is reflected in these paragraphs from her judgment: 37 Dr. Menzies discussed Christopher Jobb's ability to adequately communicate with his counsel about the facts of his charges, and specifically questioned his ability to recall events.","The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial.
The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions.
He was also charged with two indictable thefts.
He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse.
He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment.
He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board.
The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea.
The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel.
The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered.
The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code.
The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test.
The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness.
This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes.
Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests.
The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence."
370,"[19] The decision to allow Mr. Hanna to become reinvolved with Tristen before or near the time of Mr. Delorey and Ms. Callahan’s marriage, and the apparent abandonment of Ms. Callahan and Mr. Delorey’s earlier discussion of Tristen being adopted by Mr. Delorey are, conclude, inconsistent with conclusion that Mr. Delorey stood in the place of parent, Mr. Hanna at the time of the parties’ separation. [25] have considered the provisions of the Divorce Act, the nature length of Mr. Delorey's relationship with Ms. Callahan and Tristen, Tristen’s perspective on these relationships, the length of the marriage, Mr. Hanna's involvement with Tristen, that of his and Mr. Delorey's extended family and the other factors referred to in Chartier v.","The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.'
While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year.
The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child.
She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship.
The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife.
The child no longer had contact with the husband.
The child is not a 'child of the marriage.'
The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him.
He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child.
The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on).
Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent.
Such is not the case here."
371,"[4] The question raised on the proposed appeal is whether the chambers judged erred in enquiring into the accuracy of the facts sworn to in the proposed appellants’ affidavit, in light of the provision in Rule 407(2) that provides that the validity of the writ shall not be questioned in any interlocutory proceeding where the affidavit substantially complies with the requirements of subrule (1).","The proposed appellants and the proposed respondent were involved in litigation involving the ownership of some valuable breeding dogs that were in the possession of the proposed respondent, but claimed by the proposed appellants.
The proposed appellants sought and obtained a writ of replevin in relation to the dogs.
The proposed respondent applied for an order setting aside the writ, and ordering the dogs returned.
The chambers judge granted the application finding that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information and that to allow the writ to stand would constitute an abuse of process.
The issue on appeal is whether the chambers judge erred in inquiring into the accuracy of the facts sworn to in the proposed appellant's affidavit, in light of the provision in Rule 407(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules that provides that the validity of the writ shall not be questioned in any interlocutory proceeding where the affidavit substantially complies with the requirements of the Rule.
HELD: Leave to appeal is granted.
The ruling of the chambers judge raises an issue of considerable importance to the general operation of the writ of replevin as provided for in the Rules of Court."
372,"[7] Upon her bankruptcy, the applicant’s property, subject to exemptions, vested and remains vested in the trustee unless it is released to her by the trustee or re-vested by court order under the Act. Zemlak, supra is the leading authority in this province referring to trustee’s handling of the non-exempt value of bankrupt’s home.","A bankruptcy petition against the applicant was filed on May 18, 1995 and a receiving order with respect to her property issued the following month. KPMG Inc. (formerly Peat Marwick Thorne Inc.) is the trustee of her bankrupt estate.
The applicant received an absolute discharge on March 8, 1996.
The trustee has never applied for a discharge.
The trustee did not oppose the applicant's discharge and in its report dated February 8, 1996 stated that the there were no facts, matters or circumstances that would justify the Court in refusing an unconditional order of discharge.
Now, more than 13 years later, there remains an unresolved issue concerning non-exempt equity in the applicant's homestead.
The applicant applies for relief under s. 37 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for an order reversing the trustee's decisions and restoring the property interest to her.
The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that only the value of non-exempt homestead equity existing at the time of the bankrupt's application for discharge can be attached by the trustee.
HELD: The Court made the order applied for by the applicant including an order for costs."
373,"C-46 (the “Criminal Code”) requiring court, when it imposes sentence for an offence that involves the abuse of person under the age of 18 years, to give primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence.","The accused was found guilty of the following offence: for a sexual purpose touching A. M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code.
After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate.
The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions.
HELD: The accused is sentenced to 9 months incarceration.
Pursuant to s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code, a firearm order was made for 10 years prohibiting the accused from possessing any type of weapon.
The accused shall also supply a sample of his DNA for analysis.

374,"66) Mrs. Karpinski’s evidence regarding the occasions when Ms. Schira and Mr. Snider came to the home, without Ms. Mui, differed materially from that given by each of them. 113) In direct contrast to the evidence of Mr. Karpinski, Ms. Mui presented almost equally implausible evidence that neither she nor Ms. Schira knew that the house had been moved until after the conditions had been removed on June 23, 1999.","The plaintiff bought a house.
She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon.
The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski.
The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations.
She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects.
She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser.
She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her.
The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently.
The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors.
Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages.
The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses.
Two main issues are raised.
The first is the liability of each of the defendants.
The second issue is quantum of damages.
The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues.
HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract.
Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation.
Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage.
In that respect their liability is concurrent.
The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several.
As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.
 1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17.
It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events.
The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283.
2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt.
3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court.
They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action.
Their evidence was largely unchallenged.
The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters.
Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved.
No inspection was done after the house was moved.
4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS).
The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting.
The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house.
The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems.
It should have been disclosed.
Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage.
The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper.
The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5)
It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS.
A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007]
O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL).
The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage.
The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home.
With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply.
6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff.
The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168.
7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent.
8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999.
She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase.
Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion.
At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed.
Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case.
The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment.
Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different.
Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase.
9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation.
He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'.
This was incorrect.
Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS.
He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage.
He also knew the skylight leaked.
The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.
 10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613.
She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home.
There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract.
She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages.
Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed.
Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed.

375,"Heard: November 26, 2009, in Halifax, Nova Scotia Counsel: Beth Newton, for the Applicant/Defendant Allen Fownes, for the Respondent/Plaintiff By the Court: [1] C & R Sterling Farm, one of the defendants in the main proceeding, moves for an order terminating an attachment order against it, pursuant to Rule 44.10.","The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor.
The latter was not opposed.
There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence.
The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court.
Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested.
Neither party has a connection to Halifax.
The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County.
The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant.
An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations.
Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order.
The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil.
The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders.
The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions.
The affidavit in question was flawed.
It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it."
376,"If such an application is made, it shall be:  (a) Served and filed on or before August 27, 2010;  (b) Made returnable on September 23, 2010 at 10:00 a.m or such other date as may be designated by the court on application by the plaintiffs; and  (c) Provide for the hearing of the certification motion to be held on or before February 18, 2011.","Defendants brought an application for an order setting a date for the plaintiffs' application for certification of the class action.
The plaintiffs had failed to meet the litigation schedule by failing to deliver their written arguments and authorities and had not applied for an extension.
HELD: The order of the Court established a timeline for the plaintiffs certification application and set a hearing date."
377,"March 29, 2007] [9] SCU objects to Burroughs discharge on the following grounds: the bankrupt’s assets are not equal to fifty cents on the dollar compared to his unsecured liabilities (s.173(1)(a)) the bankrupt failed to keep his books and records and failed to disclose the business transactions in the three year period before bankruptcy (s.173(1)(b)) the bankrupt continued to trade after becoming insolvent (s. Burroughs is resourceful, hard working person with ability to earn off-farm income to satisfy this order which in turn will release him from all claims provable in this bankruptcy.","The Bankrupt applies for his discharge from bankruptcy.
The discharge is opposed by the Credit Union and the trustee.
The Bankrupt was a cattle farmer.
He financed this undertaking principally through the Credit Union.
HELD: The Bankrupt will be discharged conditional upon payment of $8,000 in addition to surplus income of $2,250 to his estate for the benefit of his creditors.
He should be able to comply with this order within 3 years.
 1) The bankrupt is 42 years old and a first time bankrupt.
He is employed with an excavating company and earns $20 an hour and works as much as 160 hours per week.
He is paying $1,000 per month on his mortgage and is trying to catch up on mortgage arrears to stave off foreclosure.
He is working hard and living a subsistence life.
However, he still has some funds left with an income level above the Superintendent's Standard for a family of two.
2) His assets are less than $.50 on the dollar.
His creditors were put to the unnecessary expense by his frivolous or vexatious defence of their claim and he failed to comply with the duties of a bankrupt by failing to produce proper records and assist the trustee to the fullest.
He has been abusive and disrespectful throughout."
378,"There were problems with the fire alarm system not functioning prior to the fire which was known to the defendant’s supervisor; the defendant did not maintain, test, or inspect at all, its fire alarm system that was in excess of 25 years old at the time of the fire; the self-closing hallway “fire doors” on the third floor were continually in an open position and the north hallway door adjacent to the plaintiff’s apartment, which was open at the time of the fire, had a broken self-closing latch at the time of the fire; the battery operated smoke alarm in the plaintiff’s apartment did not function at the time of the fire. [41] In order to determine causation using the “but for” test in the present case it would have to be possible for the plaintiffs to prove that, but for the failure of the defendant to maintain functional smoke and alarm system and/or closed north hallway fire door, the plaintiffs would have had sufficient time to exit their apartment and escape down the adjacent north stairwell or to await rescue by the fire department before being overcome by smoke and jumping from the window.","The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building.
The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility.
The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula.
He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports.
Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion.
The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib.
She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip.
She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp.
The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder.
The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions.
Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income.
Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire.
Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue.
When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs.
Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs.
The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries."
379,"Grounds of Appeal [10] The landlord submits the hearing officer erred by:  (a) ...failing to give the landlord an opportunity to respond to the claims and evidence of the Respondents, David and Thelma Huntley (the “Tenants”);    (b) ...unreasonably awarding damages for moving expenses in the absence of any evidence that the alleged lack of proper notice to the tenants affected in any way their actual cost of moving; and  (c) ...unreasonably awarding rent abatement respecting the loss of use of the dining room space in the absence of any evidence as to why such space was not usable during the period for which the abatement was awarded. R. 5) [18] The landlord argues the hearing officer erred by awarding damages without any direct link or connection to actual loss incurred by the tenants.","The tenants were given short written notice to vacate their apartment unit.
The tenants applied under the Residential Tenancies Act for the return of their security deposit and damages including moving expenses.
The landlord was out of country at the time of the hearing but authorized by letter that the caretaker would attend the hearing to represent the landlord.
The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment.
The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement.
The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision.
The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable.
HELD: The landlord's appeal was dismissed.
1) The tenant gave notice of his claim by two separate documents and the landlord showed no misapprehension of the tenants' position based on his written response.
The landlord did not indicate in his letter that the caretaker had a limited role and the landlord could have sought an adjournment but did not.
 2) Section 70(6)(c) of the Act empowers the hearing officer to order payment of damages where the hearing officer considers it just and equitable.
The wording of this provision is broad and unconstrained excepting that the nature of damages that may be imposed must not be punitive.
The decision on rent abatement was principled and to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space.
The award for moving costs was intended to compensate for inconvenience, aggravation and related expenses.
The awards were reasonable both in fact and law and no reviewable error was made by the hearing officer.

380,"20) Sherri’s mother complained that Jake had not paid the rent on the family home and asked that he be evicted. Jake says that at or around the time of separation, the whole family (other than Damion) had counselling session, and that Chelsea was participating in counselling after that, but Sherri refused to let her continue on once the Court gave him primary residence of Jacob and Johnny.","The parties agree that joint custody is appropriate, but the petitioner mother asked that the principal residence of the two boys be varied and awarded to her.
The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well.

The father works long hours as a maintenance man.
The mother has four other children from previous relationships.
The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home.
The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education.
One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care.
While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home.
The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort.
The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way.
HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall.
The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father.
Joint custody was ordered.
The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines."
381,"Williams, for the Scotia Recycling Limited By the Court Orally: [1] This is Motion for Production of relevant documents pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 14.12. The request for relief must be supported by evidence, unlike Halifax Dartmouth Bridge Commission v Walter Construction Corporation [2009 NSSC 403] relied upon by the plaintiff, there is no evidence before me as to the manner of operation of the defendant’s business in the second location that would establish relevance to the issues of negligence raised in the pleadings.","Rule 14.01 – Meaning of “relevant” in Part 5
The plaintiff brought a negligence action against the defendant, stemming from a 2007 fire in premises that the defendant had rented from the plaintiff.
The plaintiff sought production of documents related to a 2009 fire at another location rented by the defendant.
The defendant resisted on the basis that the documents were not relevant.
Held, motion dismissed.
Under Rule 14.01, the motions judge must decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial.
The party seeking production must establish relevance.
Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location.
The commonality of a fire in separate buildings two years apart does not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating to the second fire."
382,"[5] The question throughout has been, and continues to be, whether the steps taken by the company and Mr. Varga in the course of operating the Weyakwin facility for the purpose of manufacturing these log-home packages were such as to bring the operation of the facility within the meaning and scope of the licensing requirements of The Forest Resources Management Act, beginning with s.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal a Queen's Bench decision that set aside the convictions of the respondents, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. and its sole director, Varga, for operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s. 18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act.
The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga.
The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands.
The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages.
In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act.
HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal.
Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1.
As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents."
383,"[2] Corporal Jason Teniuk of the RCMP swore an Information that he has reasonable grounds to believe that R.N.S. will commit either serious personal injury offence or sexual assault offence involving someone under the age of 16 years and requests that R.N.S. be bound over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. Following R.N.S.’s release from prison, the Crown obtained further Progress Report from Probation Officer, Jenna Milne, on July 12, 2011 which is contained in Tab of Exhibit P-1 and sets out that R.N.S.’s Saskatchewan Primary Risk Assessment is in the 92nd percentile, which means that only percent of Saskatchewan offenders were assessed as having more risk factors.","Criminal Law – Recognizance
The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece.
He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012.
The Crown then applied for a third recognizance.
An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over.
A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend.
The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code.
The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults.
He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated.
While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming.
As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years.
HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety."
384,"[11] For the foregoing reasons, and in accordance with the quoted case law, this Court will not grant retroactive spousal support prior to the respondent being put on effective notice that the petitioner was now seeking spousal support. (4th) 577, this Court considers the economic disparity between the respondent and petitioner’s incomes, that is $79,320.00 versus $56,103.00, is sufficiently disparate and upon which an interim award of non-compensatory spousal support is appropriate.","Family Law – Spousal Support – RetroactiveThe petitioner commenced a family law proceeding requesting divorce and equal division of family property in 2010.
She did not seek spousal support as part of her original application to the Court.
In August of 2013, the petitioner sought to amend her petition to include a claim for spousal support based on the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines.
In January of 2014, the petitioner filed an application for interim spousal support retroactive to the date of separation.
HELD: The petitioner was awarded spousal support, but the award was not retroactive to the date of separation.
The petitioner was entitled to spousal support from the date that she put the respondent on notice of her application for spousal support.
The respondent, at age 61, should not be forced to work overtime in order to meet his spousal support obligations.
The Court found there was economic disparity between the income of the petitioner and the income of the respondent and awarded an interim award of non-compensatory spousal support in the amount of $400 per month, retroactive to November 1, 2013, until further order of the Court."
385,"[8] According to the evidence presented with the application for probate, Mr. Szwagierczak was 80 years of age at the time he executed the challenged will on September 25, 2013.","Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity
After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property.
The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012.
His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will.
It was based on his first will with some revisions.
The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter.
The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters.
The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused.
When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything.
The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him.
The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will.
The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable.
The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions.
When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests.
The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it.
The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity."

The applicant applied for an order that the respondents renounce their right to probate the last will of the deceased testator, Anne Reiter, or in the alternative, for an order that they be terminated as executors of her estate.
The testator died in January 2015 and application for probate had not yet been made.
The deceased’s will had bequeathed all her property to her husband, Michael Reiter, who died in October 2015.
The respondents were named executors of his estate.
A simultaneous application had been brought by the same applicant to remove the respondents as executors of his estate (see: 2016 SKQB 15).
The applicant had failed to serve the respondents with notice of this application or the alternate executor and beneficiaries named in the will.
In addition, the applicant had misunderstood that she could rely upon evidence filed in another action that was also before the court in this application.
HELD: The application was adjourned.
The applicant was instructed to serve notice of the application and the adjournment on the alternate executor and the named beneficiaries.
As the applicant had not understood that evidence from another action could not be considered by the court on this application, the applicant was also required to file further affidavit evidence.
She was instructed to serve the material on the respondents, the alternate executor and the beneficiaries."
387,"as holding that the lender can apply the proceeds of sale against the balance owing on the portion of the loan applicable to the purchase money mortgage and then sue for the balance: [7] Mr. Justice Kyle found that where mortgage secures the purchase price of land as well as indebtedness incurred for other purposes, the lender can, after identifying the portion of the loan applicable to the purchase money mortgage, apply the proceeds realized against the balance owing on the purchase of the land and sue for the balance.","Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800.
The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land.
The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent.
The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186.
The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent.
As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency.
The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99.
The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA.
It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal.
Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23."

1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings.
The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences.
2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded.
Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.
 3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear.
Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice."
395,"83(1) is essentially similar to that flowing from Section 189a(1) of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, which provides: ""189a(1) police officer, in the lawful execution of his duties and responsibilities, may require the driver of motor vehicle to stop and the driver of motor vehicle, when signalled or requested to stop by police officer who is readily identifiable as such, shall immediately come to safe stop."" Therefore the pronouncements of the Supreme Court of Canada in such definitive cases as Dedman v. 7, and of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to the extent that it authorizes the random stop of motor vehicle and its driver by police officer acting without any reasonable grounds or other articulable cause to believe that an offence has been committed, when such stop is not part of an organized procedure such as the R.I.D.E. programme?","The respondent was convicted at trial with illegal blood alcohol level while operating a motor vehicle.
The police had stopped the respondent when they observed the passenger putting on a seat belt.
When the respondent went to the police cruiser, the police observed signs of impairment.
The summary conviction appeal court held the stop was random and constituted an arbitrary detention infringing the respondent's s.9 Charter rights.
The Crown appealed.
Allowing the appeal and restoring the conviction.
Random stops are arbitrary detentions infringing the Charters. 9 but are saved by s.1.
They are authorized in Nova Scotia under Motor Vehicle Act provisions.
In the course of checking licences, registration, insurance policy and mechanical condition police are justified in making observations to detect drinking drivers; the right to counsel under s. 10(b) is suspended during this period."
396,"A. Morrison, counsel on behalf of the Respondents (Plaintiffs), that he has briefed medical practitioners and will be calling medical experts to testify as to the nature of the injuries which evidence is beyond the medical evidence which has been disclosed to date and which evidence the accident reconstruction expert retained by the Respondents (Plaintiffs) require, the application to sever the issue of liability from the issue of quantification of damages is dismissed; (b)as condition of the dismissal of the application the Respondents (Plaintiffs) shall serve and file Notice of Expert Witness disclosing the earlier referenced medical evidence referenced by their counsel in compliance with the Rules of Court at least 60 days prior to trial; (c)the Applicants (Defendants) are given leave to thereafter apply anew to sever the trial of the issues of liability and quantification of damages claimed; (d)the costs of the application are costs in the cause.","The Defendants applied to sever the issues of liability and damages for purposes of the trial of this matter.
The trial was to be held before a jury.HELD: 1)The Court has a general discretion as to severance of issues which must be exercised judicially. 2)Severance should only be ordered when the judge has a serious reason to believe that the trial of the issue proposed to be severed will put an end to the action. 3)The Court accepted the Plaintiff's submission that expert medical evidence would be necessary to establish the cause of the accident since the Plaintiff had suffered brain damage and would be unable to testify.
This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found.
4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages.
A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues.
5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case."
397,"There was no evidence adduced that the plaintiff incurred any direct pecuniary loss as result of the sexual assaults by A., even to the extent of the cost to her of further education. But for the contribution to her loss by her uncle, the plaintiff would be entitled to an award of non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $50,000 and to an award of aggravated damages in the amount of $25,000.","The Plaintiff sued her stepfather for damages for sexual assault.
He had previously been convicted of a criminal charge based upon the same incident.
He did not defend the civil proceedings and the Plaintiff applied to have her damages assessed.
The evidence in the civil trial also disclosed that the Plaintiff had be sexually assaulted by her uncle.
HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.
1)The Plaintiff had been diagnosed as suffering from severe psychological problems as a result of the sexual assaults.
2)The Court assessed the Plaintiff's non-pecuniary damages at $50,000.00 and apportioned 80% of this sum or $40,000.00 to the step-father.
3)The Plaintiff was also awarded $25,000.00 in punitive damages as against the stepfather."

This is an application of the Rosetown and District Community Bond Corporation to lift the stay which is the result of the appeal taken by Precision Metal Fabricating Ltd., Loren Katzenberger and Sheryl Katzenberger from the order of Kyle J.","Related decision-145 SaskR 231
The chambers judge had found the conduct of the Board of Directors to be high-handed and oppressive.
A meeting of shareholders was scheduled for July 22nd at which time the voting rights of the shareholders was to be changed.
That order was under appeal.
HELD: The application to lift the stay was dismissed with costs to follow the result of the appeal.
1)If the order was not upheld on appeal it would be difficult to undo the results of the July meeting.
2)The current directors had the most to lose if their decisions did not reflect the best interests of the company and were not made in a sound and business-like fashion."
399,GCB says it entered into negotiations with REAL in November of 1995 for possible relocation of the bingo hall to other premises as an alternative to renewal of the existing lease.,"An application for an interim injunction restraining the Regina Exhibition Association (REAL) from interfering with GCB's enjoyment of certain leasehold premises in the Jubilee Building and from entering into any lease with Regina Central Bingo (RCBA) and preventing the operation of a bingo hall by RCBA within Exhibition Park except as sub-tenant of GCB.
The original five year lease for use of the Jubilee Building as a bingo hall between Fundraising td. and REAL was assigned to GCB with REAL's written consent.
GCB further sublet the building without REAL's consent or knowledge.
Written notice of renewal was not sent to REAL.
The basis of GCB's application was estoppel on the basis that REAL entered negotiations regarding a relocation of the bingo hall and then began to deal directly with CGB's sub-tenant after the renewal date had passed.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
Costs in the cause.
1)There was no evidence that Fundraisers, the original party to the lease, attempted to exercise the option to renew.
2)GCB did not have a strong prima facie case on the merits.
It appeared that there were no negotiations between GCB and REAL.
3)There would not be irreparable harm.
Under the current arrangements, the bingo would be operated by RCBA.
If successful at trial the damages to GCB can be easily calculated based on the time it was unable to occupy the premises.
4)On balance GCB failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the inconvenience it will suffer by the refusal of the injunction will be greater than that suffered by REAL if granted."
400,"Further the arrears are reduced by $7,000.00 and when the respondent earns $2,200.00 per month or more he shall pay $200.00 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation.","The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600.
The original corollary relief was made in 1989.
An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted.
The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed.
She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue.
HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less.
Arrears were reduced by $7,000.
When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation.
The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office.
1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances.
2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance.
It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations.
Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate."
401,"McIver for the Maintenance Enforcement Office Laurie Friesen on her own behalf REASONS FOR CONFIRMING PROVISIONAL ORDER ROTHERY J. May 12, 1997 I will confirm the provisional order but reduce the monthly child maintenance from $300.00 per month per child to $50.00 per month per child, for the following reasons:  The respondent, Laurie Friesen, earns approximately $12,000.00 per year gross. In light of that cost, reduce the child maintenance to $100.00 per month, or $50.00 per month per child; commencing June 1, 1997.","Reasons for confirming provisional order.
HELD: The provisional order was confirmed but the monthly child maintenance was reduced from $300 per child to $50 as the respondent earned approximately $12,000 per year gross.
Based on federal guidelines she would be required to pay $142 for the two children but had unusually high costs for exercising access as the former husband lived in Alberta."
402,"Privilege in these documents was upheld on the basis that the accountants were acting as representatives of the company for the purpose of obtaining legal advice ""concerning the setting up of some arrangement such as that that the appellant in fact entered into."" Counsel for the respondent in the matter before me argued that Susan Hosiery should be distinguished, however, because the auditor in that case was acting as representative, or agent, of the client claiming privilege in the sense of being conduit for information passing between solicitor and client.","An application pursuant to s232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for a determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada had sought disclosure.
The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors.
The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions.
The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm.
At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties.
HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld.
2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction.
One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.
 3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.
The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor.
Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency.
7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery.
They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants.
8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice.
Notes prepared by the accountant and the interoffice communications summarizing discussions with the solicitor also fell within the scope of privilege."
403,"Those claims are as follows: Royal Bank interest charges (16 months April 1991 to July 1992): $5,549.00 Repairs and Maintenance: 11,000.00 Legal Fees: 18,429.31 Rental Income Lost: 10,200.00 Mileage: 1,680.00 Lost wages (John Burton): 500.00 Loss of sale of property to one Charles Dorrington: 200.000.00 TOTAL: $247,358.31 The plaintiffs are also claiming $200,000.00 for general damages making total claim of $447,358.31.","The defendant municipality sold property owned by the plaintiffs at a tax sale.
Because of disputes over ownership between the plaintiffs and the purchaser, the latter commenced an action against the plaintiffs seeking a declaration as to the validity of the tax deed.
The deed was held to be valid at trial, but the tax sale was found to be void on appeal.
The plaintiffs sought to recover their legal fees from the municipality and the Attorney General together with some other items of loss and general damages.
Awarding damages to the property while the plaintiffs were out of possession and bank interest for the same period,
that there is no evidence to warrant an award for general damages.
Furthermore, no legal fees awarded, as they were too remote and unforeseeable."
404,"2(1) In this Act: (g) ""collateral"" means personal property that is subject to security interest; (m) ""debtor"" means: (i) person who owes payment or performance of an obligation secured, whether or not that person owns or has rights in the collateral; (iii) lessee pursuant to lease for term of more than one year; (jj) ""purchase-money security interest"" means: (i) security interest taken in collateral to the extent that it secures all or part of its purchase price; (ii) security interest taken in collateral by person who gives value for the purpose of enabling the debtor to acquire rights in the collateral, to the extent that the value is applied to acquire those rights; (iii) the interest of lessor of goods pursuant to lease for term of more than one year; or (iv) the interest of consignor who delivers goods to consignee pursuant to commercial consignment; but does not include transaction of sale and the lease back to the seller and, for the purposes of this clause, ""purchase price"" and ""value"" include credit charges and interest payable for the purchase or loan credit; (qq) ""security interest"" means: (i) an interest in personal property that secures payment or performance of an obligation, but does not include the interest of seller who has shipped goods to buyer under negotiable bill of lading or its equivalent to the order of the seller or to the order of an agent of the seller, unless the parties have otherwise evidenced an intention to create or provide for security interest in the goods; and 22(1) purchase-money security interest in: (a) collateral, other than an intangible, that is perfected not later than 15 days after the day on which: (i) the debtor obtains possession of the collateral; or (ii) another person, at the request of the debtor, obtains possession of the collateral; whichever is earlier; or (b) an intangible that is perfected not later than 15 days from the day on which the security interest attaches; has priority over the interest of person mentioned in subsection 20(1) or (2).","Associates, which held purchase money security interests pursuant to its 1997 leases, applied under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by Associates and Humboldt Flour Mills in two reefer trailers.
Humboldt's security interests were acquired pursuant to a security agreement granted in 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in 1998 to specifically include the trailers.
It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest.
At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers.
HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.
 1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a).
What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute.
Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession.
Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession.
S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34.
4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'.
5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease.
Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date.
Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada.
Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.
 6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly.
To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air."
405,"By her own admission, the mother`s need for spousal support ended in [8] Nevertheless, when addressing claim for support, the Court should not be expected to assess the adequacy of parent`s economic contribution during the time the family was intact and then make up any inadequacy by imposing retroactive obligation. The mother was entitled to make claim for support whenever she believed the father`s contribution to be inadequate, whether or not she perceived herself separated from him.","The petitioner sought retroactive child and spousal support of $47,367.
No children were presently dependent upon her and she was self-sufficient.
The parties married in 1963.
The mother was a homemaker until 1983 when they bought and operated a small town hotel which ultimately failed in 1990.
The petitioner alleged they separated in 1990 when the father left the province to seek work elsewhere.
He sent no money for two years until 1992 when he sent $3,200 and bought a washer and dryer.
She commenced a divorce action in 1996 which was adjourned sine die by consent.
The marriage was dissolved in June 1998.
The respondent did not keep records of money sent as he did not consider they had separated until 1993.
HELD: The claim was dismissed.
1)Nothing turned on the actual date of separation which was difficult to determine.
The mother was entitled to make a claim for support whenever she believed his contribution was inadequate, whether or not she perceived herself separated from him.
2)The primary purpose of a support order is not to compensate for past failure but to satisfy present need.
Making a retroactive order would not address that purpose.
She did not make a claim until 1996 and then did not prosecute her claim for another two years, at a time when neither she nor the children were dependent."
406,"The first relates to the use of tax information concerning both the bankrupt\'s common law spouse, Patti Ann McCool and the company that she is sole director and shareholder of, Clearsky Enterprises Ltd. Counsel for the bankrupt contends that Section 241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of this information.","Revenue Canada, which was owed $166,359.72 for goods and services tax for 1991-92 and $14,223.30 for 1991 unpaid personal income tax, and the Michaluks, who were owed $58,720.34 for a failed agreement and lease on their property in Manitoba, objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt.
The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder.
The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter.
HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month.
Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.
 1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin.
The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable.
The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings.
The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings.
2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved.
It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action.
The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution."
407,"It is when the returning officer has declared the results of vote in accordance with s.109 of that Act. It is not only the starting point for determining the limitation period under The Controverted Municipal Elections Act, but also the limitation period for seeking judicial recount under 126 128 of The Local Government Election Act. The legislation is clear. Section 103 of The Local Government Election Act states the deputy returning officer shall count the vote and provide prescribed statement of results.","The applicant commenced an application pursuant to s19 of the Controverted Municipal Elections Act following the municipal election for mayor and counsellors at the village of Sandy Bay.
The Chambers judge granted the fiat to allow the applicant to serve the notice of motion and service was made within two weeks of the date of the fiat.
The respondents argued there was no jurisdiction to deal with the motion because the applicant had missed the limitation period for bringing this application as s19(1) of the Act states the application must be brought within six weeks after the election.
The fiat was granted beyond the time limit forty seven days later.
The applicant argued the time limit did not commence until after the completion of the judicial recount provided by s126-128 of the Local Government Election Act.
HELD: 1)Leave was granted to file further affidavit material proving the date the returning officer declared the results of the vote which was the crucial date for calculating the time limit for this application.
 2)The legislation is clear.
Section 103 of the Local Government Election Act states the deputy returning officer shall count the vote and provide a prescribed statement of results.
3)There was no evidence of the date the returning officer declared the results of the vote in accordance with s109.
If the returning officer declared the results on October 22/97, that date is the commencement of the six week limitation period and the application would be out of time."

409,"Bertha Langille’s testimony at trial was that, this security work had “wound down in 1992.” What is, though, significant, is that Bertha Langille’s security employment with Vince Paris for the previous three years (1990, 1991, 1992) had covered the period August to December, when in each year she would begin collecting unemployment insurance benefits.","The plaintiff was injured as a result of a motor vehicle accident.
The defendant was found liable.
At issue was the claim of the plaintiff against the defendant's insurer for Section B benefits.
The defendant paid benefits for 129 weeks.
It claimed that the plaintiff misrepresented her employment status at the time of the accident, and that the benefits should be re-paid.
The plaintiff argued in response that the defendant was estopped from claiming repayment.
Ordering the benefits be re-paid,
that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation, on the basis of representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it.
It would be illogical to prevent the defendant from getting its money back when it is found that the benefits were paid on the basis of faulty information provided by the plaintiff.
This is not a situation in which estoppel lies against the defendant."
410,"(B) at the time the sample was taken an additional sample of the blood of the accused was taken to permit an analysis of one of the samples to be made by or on behalf of the accused, (C) the time when and place where both samples referred to in clause (B) were taken, and (D) both samples referred to in clause (B) were received from the accused directly into or placed directly into approved containers that were subsequently sealed and that are identified in the certificate, (ii) certificate of qualified medical practitioner stating that the medical practitioner caused the sample to be taken by qualified technician under his direction and that before the sample was taken the qualified medical practitioner was of the opinion referred to in clause (i)(A) or (iii) certificate of qualified technician stating that the technician took the sample and the facts referred to in clauses (i)(B) to (D) is evidence to the facts alleged in the certificate without proof of the signature or official character of the person appearing to have signed the certificate; and (i) certificate of an analyst stating that the analyst has made an analysis of sample of blood of the accused that was contained in sealed approved container identified in the certificate, the date on which and place where the sample was analysed and the result of that analysis is evidence of the facts alleged in the certificate without proof the signature or official character of the person appearing to have signed it."" 27.","The Crown withdrew one count at the opening of the trial and the accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration in excess of .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code.
In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician.
HELD: The accused was found guilty.
There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving.
1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident.
2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate.
There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying.
The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient.
His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory.
There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples.
The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient.
3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required.
4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay.
The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.
 5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted."
411,2. If the answer to question is yes; what is the income and ability to pay of Mr. Vermeulen and the reasonable need of Ms. MacDonald regarding continued monthly spousal support?,"The parties were divorced two years ago and the matter had been finalized by an appeal decision in June, 1999.
Both parties made application to vary child support on the basis of changes (ups and downs) in the farming business.
The respondent wife, who recently purchased a house, also applied for lump sum spousal support which claim had been disallowed by the Court of Appeal.
Monthly spousal support terminated as wife now self-sufficient; child support increased due to increase in husband's income; lump sum payment of $8,000 awarded to wife to help pay her relocation expenses from move with husband given six months to pay lump sum, but monthly spousal support to continue until the $8,000 was paid in full.
Applications to vary should not be entertained simply because of the usual ups and downs of the farming business; the court must strive to average out the individual's ability to pay in such circumstances in order to ensure stability of payments for both parties.
Lump sum spousal support payments must not have the effect of a significant redistribution of the division of matrimonial property but the reasons for the belated application must be examined."
412,"[37] At the date of the petition the parties had bank accounts as follows: Petitioner: Toronto Dominion Bank 38.70 Bank of Montreal 205.51 Bank of Montreal GIC 9,500.00 Bank of Montreal Money Market Fund (net of October, November and December interest) 5,563.53 Royal Bank 848.39 Total: $16,156.13 Respondent: Canada Trust 640.16 [38] The petitioner's bank accounts presumably included the inheritance she received from her aunt of $2,297.85, dealt with separately, and retroactive child tax benefit of $4,604.57 received in September, 1999 which is included in the matrimonial property available for distribution, as find it should be.","The divorce action was based on separation for more than a year.
 In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property.
HELD: 1)Divorce was granted.
The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998.
2)They agreed to joint custody of both children.
The son was to reside primarily with his father.
The daughter resided with her mother.
Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends.
The children were to be together most weekends.
School vacations would be shared.
3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance.
Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense.
The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance.
4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003.
The mother's job advancement was impeded as a result of the marriage, specifically by frequent moves to accommodate her husband's job transfers.
She had worked out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing.
5)The parties agreed the matrimonial home would be sold and proceeds divided equally after payment of expenses of the sale.
Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale.
The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.
 6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage.
It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000.
The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded.
The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000.
All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition.
RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover.
7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner.
The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75.
The respondent was to assume any debts.
 8)No costs were awarded."
413,"The applicant in her second variation application seeks cancellation of the arrears of $3,800 on the basis that she will otherwise in effect be required to overpay child support had it been calculated in accordance with the Guidelines on the basis of her actual (not imputed) income for the years 1999 and 2000.","FIAT. The mother applied to vary the terms of the 1999 child support order under which she was to pay $400 per month composed of $334 for regular support plus $66 for s.7 medical and extraordinary expenses for their three children based on an imputed annual income of $18,000.
She sought to cancel arrears of $3,800 on the basis she will overpay if child support had been calculated in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines on the basis of her actual income for 1999 and 2000.
She also sought to reduce child support to $17 per month based on a projected income of $7,000.
HELD: 1)One-half of the arrears were cancelled.
The mother must accept responsibility in part for allowing arrears to accumulate over the 2 years.
2)The mother was to pay $250 per month based on an imputed income of $15,000.
She was capable of contributing more than $17 per month.
Her share of s.7 expenses was reduced to $50 per month.
Neither filed current information. 3)Costs would have been ordered if the mother had been more reasonable in her submission for variation."
414,"Section provides: 8(1) On application by claimant, the Court of Queen’s Bench may make an interim or final order restraining the disposition or wasting of assets that would impair or defeat claim pursuant to this Act. The court concluded in Anderson that it was not necessary to find predilection or intention on the part of the respondent to waste assets in order to issue an order under s.","The father was unemployed by reason of health problems and was in arrears on the December 13, 2002 child support order for $454 per month.
He was seeking damages against the federal government for alleged abuses suffered while attending an Indian Residential School.
The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support.
HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel.
The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known.
There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8.
It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money.
To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8.
Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property.
The mother was awarded costs of the application set at $350."
415,Ms. Terry submits that the judge erred in principle by allowing Mr. Francis’ variation application to proceed even though he had not made adequate disclosure of his financial situation.,"The father, who was in arrears under an order requiring him to pay child support, applied to vary the support order which had been made less than a year before.
He failed to make the required financial disclosure and relied on a medical disability of which he gave no prior notice.
The judge allowed the application to proceed, over the objections of the mother, and reduced the child support obligation to $1 per month.
The mother appealed.
Appeal allowed;
the judge's decision to allow the application to proceed was procedurally unfair to the appellant and wrong in principle.
Only in rare circumstances should a party applying to reduce child support be heard absent that party making full disclosure."

Above all, upon a careful consideration of all of the evidence, we have not been persuaded that the interests of the children would be better served by the parenting regime proposed by the appellant. BAYDA C.J.S. FOR THE COURT","Fulltext of judgment follows:
[1] This appeal from an order respecting custody and access to children cannot succeed.
The trial judge made no error of principle, and there was evidence to support his findings of fact.
He took all relevant matters into account and relied on no irrelevant matters.
Above all, upon a careful consideration of all of the evidence, we have not been persuaded that the interests of the children would be better served by the parenting regime proposed by the appellant.
[2] The appeal is accordingly dismissed without costs to either party."
417,"[66] In determining quantum, have considered the length of the marriage, the relative financial positions of the parties, the relationship Mr. Bishop has formed (and the fact that his partner receives child support) and Ms. Bishop’s ongoing illnesses and inability to work. Finally, if Mr. Bishop makes an assignment in bankruptcy or a proposal under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, which has the effect of requiring Ms. Bishop to pay any of the matrimonial debts, she will be entitled to apply for a variation in spousal support to cover any amount she is required to pay.","The parties were married for twelve years; there were no children of the marriage.
The husband was in the military; the wife was a cleaner on a military base when the parties met and she changed jobs at the husband's direction.
She now stated that she was unable to return to work due to health problems, including irritable bowel syndrome, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder.
Both parties accused the other of conduct which diminished matrimonial assets.
The wife's mother had advanced the parties a considerable amount of money during the marriage, with the final advance being the subject of an IOU.
The husband is to be responsible for the matrimonial debts, with the net proceeds from the sale of matrimonial home to be paid ratably to those creditors; the wife is to receive 35% of the husband's pension entitlement; husband to pay spousal support in the amount of $1,000 per month for a period of ten years with the order open to variation if the wife obtains a C.P.P. disability pension or becomes fit to work or if the husband retires from the military or makes a proposal or an assignment in bankruptcy which has the effect of requiring the wife to pay any of the matrimonial debts."
418,"During the course of argument in this Court, Gari’s counsel advised that the relief in relation to rent and property taxes had been included in the motion not because those matters were conditions precedent to the Credit Union removing the Building but because, as Gari was going to be in court anyway on the matter of security for removal damage, it seemed useful to seek additional relief as well.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA).
The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union.
The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest.
The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent.
The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
Cross appeal dismissed.
In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.
 1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures.
It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other.
There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so.
2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it.
Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA.
3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them.
The respondent's claims in this regard fail.
4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief.
As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument.
5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails."

The respondent's income as reported in his income tax return for the past 3 years has been in the $70,000 range.
However, he is also the sole shareholder of a corporation and the 50% owner of another corporation.
The corporations have been very profitable and the retained earnings of both companies far exceed the amount of long term debt.
HELD: 1) The respondent has deemed additional income of $50,000 and $27,200 from the two companies.
2) The imputed annual income of the respondent is $150,000.
3) Costs in the amount of $750 to the petitioner."
420,134 (1.1) No person shall apply to the Registrar of Titles to register transfer of title or to obtain title to new parcel of land where registration of that application would have the effect of subdividing land unless: (a) the Controller of Surveys has approved plan respecting the subdivision; and (b) the appropriate approving authority has issued certificate of approval respecting the subdivision.,"FIAT: The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding an un-subdivided parcel of land.
The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act.
HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order.
Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders.
The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2)
While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings.
Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act.
The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3)
The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues."

He was suspended from the program since approximately March 2000.
There have been a number of legal proceedings between the applicant and the University since then.
An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms.
This decision has not been implemented.
At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments.
The applicant is such a student.
His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended.
The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program.
The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter.
HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding.
The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts.
2) The applicant is entitled to relief.
The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met.
The applicant must enter into a written agreement with the College of Medicine whereby he agrees that the money he was paid while on suspension is prepayment for all of the services he will perform for the College of Medicine in the remainder of his residency, that he will not claim any salary or monetary benefits available to other medical residents pursuant to the PAIRS agreement, and he will indemnify the College of Medicine if it is required to make payments to him pursuant to the PAIRS agreement during the remainder of his residency program.
Further, PAIRS will enter into an agreement with the College of Medicine waiving the financial terms of the PAIRS agreement with respect to the applicant for the duration of his residency.

422,"Williams Oral Argument: December 5, 2006 Written Decision Delivered Orally: December 8, 2006 Counsel: Gary Holt, for the Crown Megan Longley, for the Defendant Peter McVey, for the Department of Community Services Nancy Rubin, for the Chronicle Herald Alan Parrish, for the Daily News By the Court: INTRODUCTION: [1] Counsel on behalf of the media, the crown, the young person, T.C., and the legal parent/guardian of T.C., The Minister of Community Services seek a ruling from this Court as to whether the public, including the media, will be permitted to attend the court convened pre-sentencing conference, scheduled to take place on December 11, 2006.","A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference.
The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence.
Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present.
Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press.
Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media.
The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth.
There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals."

Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist, the Facility Association defended the plaintiff's action against him; however, the plaintiff also brought an action against the insurer of a motor vehicle policy under which the deceased was insured.
At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff.
The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties."
424,Did the Chambers judge err in finding that the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make an order granting possession on the basis that “[t]he rent was 15 days or more in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice” if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession?,"The tenants apply pursuant to s. 49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench reviewing a decision of the Rentalsman.
HELD: Application allowed.
 1) The parties agree that the rent for July was paid on July 27.
The landlord then immediately applied for and was granted a writ of possession. 2)
The tenants advise that the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month rent of the tenancy.
The landlord claims it is a security deposit. 3)
The tenants claim they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arrears were accepted on that basis. 4)
The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's appeal the same day saying 'the rent for August has not been paid and not paid by required time, appeal is dismissed'.
5) The first issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in finding the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make the order granting possession on the basis that 'the rent was 15 days in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice' if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession.
The second issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid."

The Crown concedes that there is no reason to detain the accused youth to ensure her attendance in court or to prevent further occurrences.
The Crown asks that she be detained because the crime is so horrible, the case is so strong and the public in La Ronge are so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence in the administration of justice.
HELD: The court does not keep a person in custody simply because they are accused of committing an offence.
There must be a necessary and substantial reason to keep a person in custody before they have a trial.
The accused youth will be released on strict conditions that will continue until her trial is complete."
426,"The Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim discloses no reasonable cause of action. 3. As the Plaintiff fails to address the most basic elements of cause of action in defamation, the claim lacks substance and merely serves to scandalize and annoy the Defendant.","FIAT: This is an application for an order striking out the plaintiff's claim in defamation pursuant to rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules.

1) Contrary to the submissions of counsel for the defendant, all essential elements of a claim in defamation are set out.
A reasonable cause of action is disclosed.

HELD: 1) The applicant has established the necessary change in circumstance, namely the introduction of the Guidelines.
Based on the applicant's income, his child support payment is reduced from $500 per month to $425 per month.
 2) The applicant is in arrears in the amount of $56,365.60.

428,"v. Grant, 1991 CanLII 38 (SCC), [1991] S.C.R. 139, the court held that where the driver of vehicle was detained for 30 minutes while the police waited for roadside machine and the accused was not informed of his rights to counsel, that the demand after that time was not made “forthwith” and his right to counsel had been infringed by the delay. [21] In the circumstances of this case the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained Shire in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of Shire’s vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights.","The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code.
The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code.
At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately.
On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made.
The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed.
It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported.
Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights.
It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle.
In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights.
The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed."
429,"[4] In sentencing each of these accused persons, the court will rely only on the facts presented by the Crown and accepted by each of the accused in relation to the description of the assault itself and the participation of each accused in that assault, and in the injuries which are alleged to have been suffered by Mr. Flood as the victim of this assault. [24] Mr. Kadash spent five days in custody after his arrest on this charge and he was released on August 31, 2006 on number of conditions which include the following: keep the peace and be of good behaviour; report to the court when required to do so; report in person to the bail verification and supervision officer at times to be specified; reside at an approved residence or one approved by the bail verification officer; advise of any change of employment, education or contact with police officials; not travel beyond 60 k’s of his residence without prior written approval; abstain from the use or possession of alcohol or non-prescription drugs; not enter any premises where the primary function is the sale or consumption of alcohol; and non contact with Crystal and Wallace Flood.","The two accused entered a guilty plea to committing an assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code.

430,"[34] The Chambers judge, when addressing this argument, concluded at 64 of his decision: [64] I am satisfied that there is not a real chance of success on the arguments advanced by Mr. Giffin respecting Chrysler\'s alleged liability by operation of the Motor Vehicle Act. Neither the argument that the lease between Chrysler and Mr. Giffin was actually a rental contract pursuant to s.","The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff.
The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle.
The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence.
The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee.
Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle."
431,"She made important tactical decisions on the strength of disclosure received from the Crown relating to such things as her election to trial, agreements with respect to the video taped evidence and her undertaking to give evidence in the event that charges against her were not dismissed on a defence motion following the close of the Crown’s case. v. Egger, 1993 CanLII 98 (SCC), [1993] S.C.R. 451, pointed out that Crown disclosure can affect such questions as how the accused meets the Crown’s case, advances defence or otherwise makes decision that may affect the conduct of the defence i.e., whether to call evidence.","The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence.
Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention.
The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure.
Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial.
The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage.
However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function."

Application granted;
although the parties' separation agreement included a waiver of any right to share in or administer the other's estate, it did not serve to revoke the will; nor did equitable estoppel apply in the circumstances.

The accused also entered guilty pleas to three charges stemming from breaches of no-contact conditions with the same complainant plus two charges of obstruction of justice by attempting to dissuade the same complainant from giving evidence.
The RCMP had to execute a Feeney warrant to locate the complainant in the accused basement.
The Crown sought an order declaring the accused a dangerous offender.
HELD: The accused was designated a dangerous offender and was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period on the conviction pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and received time served on the remaining eight charges.
The evidence is conclusive that the offence for which the accused was convicted was a serious personal injury offence.
The evidence was conclusive that the accused constitutes a threat to other persons because of his pattern of repetitive behaviour and persistent aggressive behaviour.
The accused's First Nation would provide support for the accused but its support system is presently non-existent.
The Court rejected the expert opinions recommending a long term offender order as being appropriate."
434,"[11] In summary then, M.M. is found in car driven by Candace MacDonald, who says she drove straight from Sackville, with person, K.M., who has pleaded guilty to the robbery that had taken place few minutes before in Sackville. Given the probability that M.M. left Sackville with the others in Candace MacDonald’s car, after robbing Nykell Brooks, it seems logical to resolve the discrepancy by assuming that Nykell Brooks was either mistaken or not telling the whole truth.","The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery.
A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery.
The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men.
While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger.
At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened.
Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person.
Accused found not guilty on all charges;
the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car.
Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt."
435,"Walter Thompson, QC, for the plaintiff Sarah Drodge, for the defendant By the Court: [1] The Defendant Attorney General of Canada (AGC) moves for an order for summary judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.03 (1)(a) and (c) on the grounds that: 1) The statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action; and 2) The statement of claim otherwise makes claim that is clearly unsustainable when the pleading is read on its own.","Rule 13.03 – Summary judgment on pleadings, motion granted on the basis of Rule 13.03(1)(c)).
While the claim discloses a possible cause of action based on the Attorney General's statutory undertakings, this alone doesn't decide the matter.
The amendments add nothing by way of necessary detail to the claim, which doesn't plead sufficient material facts to comply with the Rules on pleadings (see Rule 4.02)."
436,"[2] Section of The Small Claims Act provides as follows: 7(1) If the judge is satisfied that the plaintiff may have valid claim, the judge shall issue summons that: (a) is directed to the person or persons against whom the claim is made; (b) states the time of the case management conference or time of the trial and the court location that the judge considers appropriate.","The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals.
The issue was whether the claims should be issued.
HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued.
In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function.
Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case.
The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief.
A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract.
Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement.
As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court.
Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench."
437,"[12] Accordingly, the plaintiffs submitted that the simplified trial should proceed pursuant to Rule 269, the dissolved corporate defendant not being allowed to partake in the process.","Under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules (QBR), the plaintiffs commenced an action in 2009 against the defendant for the return of their deposit and the recovery of their costs for plans with respect to a residential construction contract.
The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012.
The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew.
Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved.
This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial?
HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act.
With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action.
As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it.
Since the parties had given notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case, the Court ordered that the deponents be produced for the purpose of cross-examination."
438,"[26] Given that: i) the defendant was entitled to harvest dead wood from Crown lands for his personal heating; ii) there was no direct evidence establishing that the wood sold to Clarke or in the 150 and 58 truckloads contained any wood harvested from Crown lands; iii) there was no direct evidence that the defendant was in possession of illegally-harvested forest products; and iv) the finding that during the time period referenced by the Information, the defendant harvested and sold wood from private lands; jury could reasonably have found, as the trial judge found, that the charges of unlawfully harvesting or possessing were not proven.","The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act.
He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third.
He appealed his conviction.
He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge.
The Crown appealed the sentence.
The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking.
The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant.
He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land.
He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative.
If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit.
The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land.
The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted.
The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant.
The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending.
With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer.
The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands.
HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent.
It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise.
The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven.
However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality.
Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence.
The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products.
Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act.
The conviction was upheld.
Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders.
The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low.
The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations.
If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days."
439,"While the wording of an agreement or order can be an important factor in the case of shared parenting arrangement, if both parents are required to pay child support resulting in set-off, Canada Revenue Agency appears to take the position that no one is entitled to claim the AED or the federal child amount tax credit for such child unless the parents agree on who will be making the claim. It needs to be understood that in the context of spousal support proceeding the court cannot dictate to the Canada Revenue Agency how it is to apply the provisions of the Income Tax Act. While the respondent may at present receive the child tax benefit for all three children, it is assumed that will change once the Canada Revenue Agency becomes aware of the shared parenting arrangement and it may be that it is not possible for parents to “agree” on who will receive the child tax benefit.","The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues.
The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'.
The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting.
The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount.
The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession.
The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it.
She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000.
The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children.
HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement.
Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck.
The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013.
The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses.
The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month.
The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference."

The accused was charged with an offence contrary to s. 203(1) of The Traffic Safety Act, driving over 60 km/h passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone.
The accused was charged as the owner of the vehicle, not necessarily the driver.
The offence was the result of a speed monitoring camera and the Act allows the Crown to complete their case without calling any witnesses.
The accused testified that he did not speed past any highway workers or equipment.
He said that he was following a pilot vehicle when he passed the workers and equipment and only sped up after the pilot vehicle turned around when there were no more workers or equipment.
The picture of the accused’s vehicle from the speed monitoring camera did not show any highway workers or equipment.
HELD: The person who tested and deployed the speed monitoring camera provided affidavit evidence that the picture was taken within a marked construction area but it did not say that the accused was speeding as he was passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment.
Section 203(1) specifies that there is only an offence for travelling at a speed greater than 60 km/h when passing highway workers or operating equipment.

Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit.
The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties.
There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay.
The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced.
In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials.
In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided.
The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky.
On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act.
Husky was the user or consumer of the cement.
The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well.
Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts.
Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property.
Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law.
Husky has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that it is entitled to a refund of the PST it paid on well cementing contracts between itself and third parties.

442,"[6] As Mr. Schmidt indicated willingness to “continue removing offending stored equipment” and given the amount of equipment still remaining on Parcel A, the contempt application was adjourned to October 3, 2014 to give Mr. Schmidt the opportunity to provide the court and the RM with written plan on how he intended to comply with the Court Order.","Civil Procedure – ContemptCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 11-16Municipal Law – Zoning Bylaw – Enforcement
The applicant rural municipality was granted an order in May 2014 by a Queen’s Bench judge that directed the respondent to comply within 60 days with an order of the applicant’s development officer.
That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it.
The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it.
The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order.
After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court.
The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment.
He requested that he receive additional time.
The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order.
At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect.
Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter.
When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it.
The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour.
HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order.
The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued.
The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw.
As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time."
443,"The foregoing case law indicates that once an interim custody arrangement has been in place for some time, whether de facto, by court order, or by agreement of the parties, the non-primary care parent should not apply on an interim basis to vary the arrangement (except where risk to the child exists), but proceed to final order. The respondent was somewhat successful on the notice of objection to affidavit evidence [70] In the circumstances, I direct the petitioner shall be entitled to costs in the fixed amount of $1,000.00 with respect to all of the matters brought before the court.","Family Law – Custody and Access – Best Interests of ChildFamily Law – Custody and Access – Interim – VariationFamily Law – DivorceFamily Law – Evidence – AffidavitThe parties were in a high-conflict situation and brought five interim applications with various requests.
They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application.
At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready.
The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home.
The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him.
The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared.
The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school.
The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained.
The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist.
The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements. 
There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born.
The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny.
The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time.
The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm.
He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle.
The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance.
The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs.
HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school.
The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner.
The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue.
The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested.
The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause.
The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause.

444,"[7] The issues for me to determine are:    (1) Whether there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt Mr. Lehman’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol;  (2) Whether Mr. Lehman’s evidence, together with expert Mary Ellen Scott’s evidence, raises a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle for Cst. Cobbledick; and  (3) Whether Mr. Lehman had a reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the police officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer.","Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08
The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)).
As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours.
When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off.
The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house.
The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD.
He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17.
The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired.
He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him.
He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples.
The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal.
The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving.
The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes.
The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45.
An alcohol expert and the accused testified.
The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to.
The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer.
The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007.
HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence.
The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis.
The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections.
The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption.
Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions.
The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances.
The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping.
There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face.
The accused was found guilty of the evading charge."

446,"[3] In the course of pre-charge conference with Crown and defence counsel, the trial judge sought input from counsel as to whether Vetrovec warning (R Vetrovec, 1982 CanLII 20 (SCC), [1982] SCR 811 [Vetrovec]) should be given to the jury in relation to the testimony of Ms. Saxon and Mr. Windrum.","Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury
The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury.
He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim.
The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well.
During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence.
The defence counsel then withdrew his application.
The victim had been a friend of the appellant.
According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard.
The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash.
S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other.
She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life.
The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun.
As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun.
The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field.
Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered.
The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013.
She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident.
At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was.
When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant.
S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident.
The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons.
The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery.
The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck.
The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns.
S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times.
She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems.
The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend.
Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times.
On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later.
The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident.
In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning.
It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel.
The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury.
The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury.
The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference."
447,"Thus, what have categorized as Ag Credit’s peremptory reasons for claiming entitlement to the surpluses fails, the evidence before me satisfies me, consistent with the concerns of Empire Life, that the insured parties under the Policy may be the persons entitled to the return of the surplus premiums paid.","Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75
The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy.
The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided.
Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent.
It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary.
The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths.
Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant.
There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation.
HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings.
The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus.
It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus."
448,"With the exception of the two quarters of farmland registered in the name of the respondent, all matrimonial property owned by the parties on the date the application was commenced was acquired during the time the parties cohabited as man and wife.","Division of matrimonial property.
Husband owned farm land at the time of the marriage.
During the marriage he spent heavily on booze and drugs.
Wife spent her savings and employment income on the farming operation and family expenses.
Held: Inequitable and unfair to exempt value of farm land from matrimonial assets.
Equal division ordered, to be paid in installments secured against the land.
Husband ordered to pay maintenance for support of the children."
449,"The reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered orally by CHIPMAN, J.A.: The appellant appeals from his conviction following a trial in the Supreme Court before a jury on a charge that he:  ""did assault Richard MacKay, a Peace Officer, to wit: a Police Constable for the Town of Bridgewater, engaged in the execution of his duties contrary to Section 270(2)(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada."" In the early morning hours of October 24, 1989, Constable MacKay of the Bridgewater Town Police and two other officers responded to call on LaHave Street in connection with disturbance.","The appellant appealed his conviction for assaulting a police officer engaged in the execution of his duty.
The police officer had responded to a call in connection with a disturbance during which the appellant assaulted a third person.
Upon arriving at the scene the officer recognised the appellant as someone wanted by the police.
The officer told the appellant that he was under arrest because of two outstanding warrants.
The appellant assaulted the officer.
The officer did not give evidence as to the grounds for his belief that the warrants met the s. 495(1)(c) Criminal Code requirement, i.e., that they were in a format set out in Part XXVIII and in force within the jurisdiction.
In his charge to the jury the trial judge indicated that the arrest was for the assault against the third party and did not direct the jury to consider if the officer had reasonable grounds for believing that there were warrants outstanding.
Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial,
that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the officer arrested the appellant for the assault on the third party and it was not made clear to the jury that they must make an essential determination if the officer had reasonable grounds as required in s. 495 of the Code, such that he was acting in the execution of his duty."
450,The trial judge reviewed the evidence in detail and referred specifically to the testimony of the other members of the complainant's family that contradicted her evidence that the sexual assaults occurred on Friday night at her home. The trial judge noted that the evidence of the complainant had been consistent and given in reasonable manner.,"Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility.
Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place.
However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction.
The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered."
451,"198, provides as follows: ""7(1) Every person who brings into the Province or who receives delivery in the Province of tangible personal property acquired by him for value for his own consumption or use in the Province, or for the consumption or use in the Province of other persons at his expense, or on behalf of, or as agent for, principal, who desires to acquire such property for the consumption or use in the Province by such principal or other persons at his expense, shall immediately report the matter in writing to the Commissioner and supply to him the invoice and all other pertinent information as required by him in respect of the consumption or use of such property, and at the same time shall pay to Her Majesty in right of the Province the same tax in respect of the consumption or sue of such property as would have been payable if the property had been purchased at retail sale in the Province."" The appellant contends that as the vessel was brought into Nova Scotia and used in the Province it immediately became subject to the Health Services Tax Act. The respondent argues that the Province can only impose ""direct taxation within the Province"" and that temporary presence is not sufficient to raise an assessment under the Act. He relies on the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in R.","A sailboat, which was owned by a resident in Nova Scotia and registered in the province, but which was purchased in Finland and kept in the United States and the Carribean, and which was twice in Nova Scotia under customs permits to participate in races, did not have a sufficient presence in the province to be subject to an assessment under the Health Services Tax Act."
452,"Dr. Mahar believes the left hip injury was caused when Mr. Hiltz braced his leg with the knee extended, resulting in symptoms of tingling, discomfort, sharp pain in his knee and pain in his left hip and groin.","The plaintiff claimed damages for injuries suffered as a result of his car being hit from behind.
He had continued pain in the neck, shoulder, back and hip four and one half years after the accident.
Throughout this period, the plaintiff missed only three days and then three weeks of work.
The medical evidence conflicted as to whether the injuries were the cause of the continued pain.
Awarding $25,000 valued at date of judgment with an adjusted interest rate.
The court found the injury was mild and not the cause of the continued pain.
The plaintiff was found to have chronic pain syndrome."
453,"(4) Where, in any proceeding by landlord for possession of residential premises, it appears to the Rentalsman that: (a) notice to terminate the tenancy agreement was given to the tenant because of the tenant's bona fide complaint to the Rentalsman or to any other agency of the Government of Saskatchewan alleging the contravention of any statute, bylaw or other law dealing with health or safety standards, including housing standards; (b) notice to terminate the tenancy agreement was given to the tenant because of the tenant's attempt to secure or enforce his rights under this Act; or (c) on the evidence presented, the landlord has contravened term or condition of the agreement or has contravened any condition set out in section 20; the tenant may in the same proceedings apply to the Rentalsman for relief and the Rentalsman may grant such relief, including relief with respect to payment of rent or reasonable compensation and the granting of an injunction to restrain any contravention as mentioned in clause (c), as he considers just having regard to the proceedings, the conduct of the parties and to all other circumstances.","The landlord applied for possession of residential premises after his tenants refused to vacate in response to a written notice to vacate.
The deputy rentalsman ordered that the landlord should have possession, but also ordered that the last two months rent would abate in order to assist the tenants with their moving costs.
The landlord appealed the abatement of rent and a chambers judge reversed the deputy rentalsman.
The tenants sought and were granted leave to appeal the chambers judge and this appeal resulted.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
1)The chambers judge could only reverse the deputy rentalsman if he exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law.
2)The deputy rentalsman had jurisdiction to order an abatement of rent pursuant to S.47(4) of the Act.
3)The jurisdiction is a discretionary one.
The court will therefore show some deference to a decision of the rentalsman involving this jurisdiction.
In this case the deputy rentalsman made no reversible error."

They later tried to sell the franchise without success.
Eventually they turned the franchise back and sued for damages alleging that the Defendants had interfered in their attempts to sell the franchise and had wrongfully refused to consent to a sale negotiated by the Plaintiffs.
The Defendants counterclaimed for unpaid royalties and rent.
The parties each prepared and served their Statements as to Documents.
Both parties then applied for production of additional documents under Rule 212.
The Defendant also sought further particulars of certain matters referred to in the Plaintiff's Defence to Counterclaim under Rule 164.
HELD: Applications allowed.
Both of the parties were ordered to produce some of the documents requested.
1)A party must disclose all documents which may contain information which either directly or indirectly enables the other party to advance his case or to damage the case of his adversary.
 2)The test of relevance on discovery is wider than that of admissibility at trial. 3)Documents brought into existence with the dominant purpose of using them in order to obtain legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation which is in reasonable prospect at the time of their creation are privileged. 4)Particulars are appropriate only (i)to enable a party to properly plead in response or (ii)to eliminate surprise.
5)The Court found that further particulars were appropriate in this case on the second ground, given the vague nature of the impugned paragraph in the Plaintiff's Defence to Counterclaim."
455,"The appellant sought conviction under Subsection 363(3) which provides: 363 (3) No person shall permit property owned or occupied by that person to be unsightly or in state of disrepair, or shall permit to remain on any part of the property ashes, junk, rubbish, refuse, derelict vehicle, or bodies or parts of, vehicle, machine or equipment or dilapidated boat, or any thing of any nature whatsoever that by reason of being on the property causes the property to be unsightly or offensive.","The respondent landowner haphazardly painted his buildings in order to protest a decision of Halifax city council.
The city charged the respondent under the unsightly premises provisions of the Halifax City Charter.
At trial, the court held the wording of the City Charter could not support the charge, and that a conviction would violate the respondent's s.2(b) Charter rights to freedom of expression.
The city appealed.
Dismissing the appeal,
that the trial judge did not commit an error in law.
S.363(3) of the Halifax City Charter, under which the respondent was charged, refers to land as opposed to buildings, and cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings, a category already dealt with in s.363(6), which covers the unsightliness of buildings caused by neglect, not overt actions."
456,"[23] To summarize: Where the victim has preexisting condition, the court, in assessing what would be fair and reasonable compensation to the victim, must determine to what extent the victim's present complaint was caused by the injury sustained in the accident.' On the totality of the evidence presented, I am satisfied that at the time of the accident the plaintiff was undergoing degenerative changes in her spine.","The 46-year-old female plaintiff sought damages for injuries suffered as a result of a motor vehicle accident.
Her car was stopped by a flagman as a result of highway work when the defendant's vehicle struck her from behind.
Awarding $15,000 for the whiplash injury and $75,000 for back injury as general damages.
This amount was reduced to $25,000 due to a pre-existing condition.
The court was satisfied there were degenerative changes in the plaintiffs spine which were accelerated by the accident.
The pain problems were caused or contributed to by the defendant's negligence.
An award for lost wages was also reduced by a factor of 33.%."
457,"One is ""a victim's assistance order"" which may be obtained from the Court of Queen's Bench upon an application brought in the ordinary way by victim of domestic violence or by some person authorized to act on the victim's behalf. 3(1) An emergency intervention order may be granted ex parte by designated justice of the peace where that designated justice of the peace determines that: (a) domestic violence has occurred; and (b) by reason of seriousness or urgency, the order should be made without waiting for the next available sitting of judge of the court in order to ensure the immediate protection of the victim.","The Respondent and the Applicant had a violent argument after which the Applicant and the child left the matrimonial home and moved to Transition House.
The Applicant sought and obtained an emergency intervention order under The Victims of Domestic Violence Act from a Justice of the Peace giving her exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home and restraining her husband from having any contact with her or their daughter during the currency of the order.
This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review.
The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section.
The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered.
HELD: Order vacated.
 1)An emergency intervention order is granted by a Justice of the Peace under s.3 of the Act without notice to the person whose conduct it restrains and without any representations from that person or on that person's behalf.
It is an extraordinary remedy to be granted only where serious and urgent circumstances indicate a need for prompt action to protect the victim. 2)Absent such urgency, the application should be one for a 'victim's assistance order' brought to a Queen's Bench Judge in Chambers under s.7 in accordance with The Queen's Bench Rules.
3)In this case the domestic violence complained of occurred on January 28.
There was no evidence that on February 1, 1995, Dolgopol was at risk of immediate harm.
There was by then no element of urgency and the application for relief should have awaited the regular Queen's Bench Family Law Division chamber sittings.
 4)The Court commented that it was unclear whether this rehearing was to proceed de novo or as a review but determined that the order should not stand in any event and therefore terminated it forthwith."
458,"Thus, while noting that the statement of law by the judge of the Court of Queen’s Bench in his appellate capacity was correct, we are the view that the appropriate disposition is to set aside his judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence.","The appellant was acquitted of communicating with another person for the purpose of prostitution.
A new trial was ordered on the basis that the Provincial Court judge included a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with the respect to payment of money for specified sexual services.
The Queen's Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test that set out in R. v. Schmidt.
HELD: The proper disposition is to set aside the judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence.
1)On reading the entire oral judgment the court concluded that the judge was saying in effect that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place.
2)The trial judge was incorrect in finding that under s.213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid."
459,The petitioner argued that the respondent had consented to or acquiesced in Stefan residing in Saskatchewan with the petitioner. On the affidavit evidence before me it is clear that by June 1996 the parties were at odds with respect to Stefan\'s residence and I find that the respondent did not acquiesce to Stefan\'s residing in Saskatchewan such that it may be said he was habitually resident in Saskatchewan for the purposes of The Children\'s Law Act. It was also argued on the basis of section 15(4) that the court had jurisdiction as result of the respondent's acquiescence.,"FIAT. The petitioner sought interim custody of his son.
The respondent contested that the petition for divorce was a nullity and Saskatchewan courts did not have jurisdiction to hear the divorce proceedings and lacked jurisdiction or ought to decline to exercise jurisdiction under the Children's Law Act.
Both parties made serious allegations against the other and there was substantial conflict in the affidavit evidence.
HELD: An order for interim custody was granted on the condition the petitioner continued to reside with his parents in Regina and that the child not be removed from Regina without further court order.
1)The respondent did not acquiesce to the child's residing in Saskatchewan such that it may be said he was habitually resident here for the purposes of the Children's Law Act.
 2)The seven factors listed in s15(1)(b) are conjunctive and the petitioner must satisfy them all.
With respect to (iii) a petition for divorce was commenced in July 1996.
3)The child had a real and substantial connection with Saskatchewan and it was appropriate to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to s15(1)(b).
Jurisdiction existed pursuant to s15(3) as the child had a closer connection to Saskatchewan then to Alberta.
Both sets of grandparents and other family members on both sides reside in Saskatchewan.
The child had no connection of consequence to the Province of Alberta."
460,"7. In my opinion, and in the absence of any authority, the significant income enjoyed by the applicant is a factor to be taken into consideration when determining the amount of maintenance to be paid by the respondent, particularly when I am prepared to recognize a significant portion of the applicant\'s claim for extra-ordinary expenses.","The only issue was the amount of monthly maintenance to be paid by the respondent for the one child.
The average income of the respondent over the past three years was approximately $180,000.
The applicant claimed her 1996 income of $128,000 was extra-ordinary as payment was received for projects completed in the previous two years.
The applicant claimed special monthly expenses of $1,200 to cover nanny and child care costs, $125 for medication, $25 for recreation and $200 for a university fund.
HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay $1,794 per month.
Section 4 of the guidelines was applicable.
The significant income of the applicant is a factor to be taken into consideration.
2)The applicant did not establish that the claims for recreation and the university fund were expenses that were 'special' or 'extra-ordinary'.
3)The respondent was responsible for 2/3 of the nanny and child care costs which were justified pursuant to s7(1)(c) of the guidelines."
461,That the learned Trial Judge erred in law by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before engaging in fishing by means of a net set out in section 26(a) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations does not constitute a prima facie infringement of any existing Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes possessed by the Accused;  6.,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets.
The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman.
The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue.
The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food.
The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence.
The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence.
Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge.
The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status.
HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed.
The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial.
The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing.
2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone).
The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in.
3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed.
The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet).
4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food.
5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement.
Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable.
The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary.
6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument.
7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified."

The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision.
Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing,
that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record.
In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial.
As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons."
463,"2. The learned trial Judge erred in holding that there was no evidence to indicate that statements made by the Appellant were made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and these statements could have been made simply because the Appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police and therefore were voluntary and admissible in criminal proceedings. With respect to the learned trial judge, find it difficult to agree with her conclusions in this respect or her statement that notwithstanding the evidence of Constable Louvel already referred to she was not aware of the reason why Mr. Chow attended at the police station.","An appeal of conviction on a charge of dangerous driving on the grounds the trial judge erred in holding that statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in the criminal proceedings; and in holding the statements could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police and therefore were voluntary and admissible.
The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement.
Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness.
HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered.
During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal.
Objections to the admissiblilty of the accused's statements based upon the Charter raise a different issue and considerations from the application of common law principles and a different conclusion may have been reached."
464,"BASIS OF APPLICATIONS [3] In her statement of claim dated October 7, 1996, it was alleged that the plaintiff, as pedestrian, had, on October 26, 1995, been pinned between an automobile operated by the defendant and stationary motor vehicle, thereby causing personal injury to the plaintiff.","Plaintiff applied for an order pursuant to s.55 of the AAIA requiring SGI to pay to the plaintiff the amount awarded to her in an earlier judgment.

The defendant was convicted of dangerous driving under the Criminal Code.
The plaintiff sued for battery and assault.
The defendant was noted for default on this claim and the damages were assessed at $37,717.35, $10,000 of which were punitive.
The plaintiff submits that s.102 of the Act should not deprive a citizen of the right to sue a defendant for injuries caused by assault, battery, fraud, or similar torts.
HELD: The plaintiff has no cause for action by virtue of her injuries having been caused by an automobile.
The plaintiff was precluded by s.102 of the Act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity.

The applicant sought a declaration that the plaintiffs' solicitors had breached confidentiality and were in a conflict of interest and asked that they be removed as solicitors of record in this action.
The applicant's husband had given her personal letters, records and documents to his solicitor in 1995.
These documents were relevant to a defamation action brought by her children or their spouses.
The applicant argued that a fiduciary relationship was created when the documents were accepted which was close enough to a solicitor-client retainer to give rise to a need for confidentiality and that the public's confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined if any member of that law firm acted for the plaintiffs.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs.
No solicitor-client relationship was created between the husband's lawyer and the applicant when the documents were received.
There was no breach of confidentiality or conflict of interest as contemplated by Chapters IV and V of the Code of Professional Conduct.
No fiduciary duty was owed to the applicant when the solicitor accepted the documents from the applicant's husband.
The husband was not acting as agent for his wife nor was it accepted that he delivered the documents for safe keeping.

While am satisfied that the plaintiff was treated fairly, and the reason for its lack of success was due to negative reports on the planes it intended to use on the project, the recommendation itself contained other reasons for rejecting its tender which were specious and which would, invariably, lead the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender of four made in response to the defendant's invitation to tender on a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan.

It is an implied term of the contract that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenders fairly and will not give any an unfair advantage.
 2)The plaintiff had no experience in the type of pesticide spraying.
It was not known at the time that the plaintiff made arrangements to hire an experienced subcontractor.
The consultant hired to advise the defendant on the technical aspects of the project used reliable independent sources for his information about the operational viability of the planes.
He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.
 3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment."

In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor.
The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals.
The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid.
Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000.
Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents.
The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages.
Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained.
In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork."
469,"when one reviews the record it is easy to understand the position taken by the Crown which is for penitentiary sentence.” The judge noted the respondent’s alcohol problem, his three and one-half years of sobriety, and that the respondent did so well on probation he was released early at his own request in December of 1999.","The Crown appealed a conditional sentence of 2 years less a day imposed after the respondent pled guilty to three break and enters of dwelling houses and theft and possession of stolen property in February and March as well as two breaches of undertakings in March and June 2000.
HELD: The conditional provision was removed as time spent on electronic monitoring and post sentence efforts were considered.
A conditional sentence was not available in the circumstances.
The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions.
The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public.
The respondent had no sooner finished parole than he began to commit these crimes."
470,"[4] The respondent emphasized he was on drugs at the time of the offences and the main player was the co-accused. [6] We must say at the outset the ordering of a sentencing circle was inappropriate in these circumstances given the level of violence, the respondent’s high risk to reoffend, his consistent ignoring of or refusing to follow court orders and the fact a penitentiary term was called for, and we are all of the view leave should be granted and the appeal allowed.","The Crown sought leave to appeal a conditional sentence of 9 months of time served plus 2 years less 1 day, including 3 months on electronic monitoring, and 2 years probation with a 10 year firearm prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently.
The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation.
The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence.
The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers.
The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims.
The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences.
HELD: Leave was granted.
The appeal was allowed.
The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring.
The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed.
The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public.
A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances.
He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times.
He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment."

[1] After a decree nisi of foreclosure had issued, but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners, Ian Klarenbach, applied for judicial sale of the mortgaged property, being the matrimonial home.","FIAT. After a decree nisi of foreclosure had issued but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners (the former husband) applied for judicial sale of the matrimonial home.
The joint owners separated in 1999 and are involved in an acrimonious family law court action.
The wife has exclusive possession of the property.
The Credit Union as first mortgagee opposed the application.
The co-owner did not participate.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
1)This is not the proper forum to attempt to affect a family property settlement.
The husband was not entitled in these proceedings to a possession order.
The wife prevented every attempt to show the property to prospective owners.
There was no reason to assume she will be any more cooperative with a court appointed realtor.
The Credit Union did not request immediate possession.
2)The court's entitlement to order a judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable.
The court reviewed the history of the statutory authority for a judicial sale in a mortgage foreclosure proceedings.
The 1852 Chancery Procedure Amendment Act was repealed in 1881 and replaced by Ordinance 51, Rule 1, which became law in the NWT by virtue of the Judicature Ordinance No.6 of 1893.
It is now found in s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act in its modified form.

Application dismissed;
there was sufficient evidence to constitute reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant.
Overall the nature of the evidence was compelling with four separate and independent sources all confirming either that the defendant was selling drugs or that drugs were being sold at his residence; although individually none of the sources was of known or proven reliability, collectively they reinforced and confirmed each other; and the police conducted surveillance which corroborated the information provided by the sources."

478,"[15] The reasons for decision also show that the judge found as fact that Ms. Little did not intend the funds in question to go to the appellant for the benefit of the grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Although the trial judge did not spell it out clearly in her reasons, she obviously rejected the part of the appellant’s evidence to the effect that Ms. Little intended the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF to benefit the grandchildren and the great-grandchildren as well as himself.","The deceased made a Will appointing her only son, the appellant, as executor.
In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents.
The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly.
She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000.
After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself.
He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will.
The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him.
He appeals against that judgment.
HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.
 1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2)
The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust.
The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren.
She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact.
Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate.
In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust.
In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis.
Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate.
3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF.
The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error.
The judge made no such error.
 4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren.
The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased.
The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him.
The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee.
The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence"
479,"[3] That left Justice Koch to consider whether to dismiss the petition pursuant to ss. [4] As for the first, the debtor did not satisfy Justice Koch that he was able to pay his debts or that there existed other sufficient cause to dismiss the petition.","Fulltext of judgment follows:[1]
It will not be necessary for us to hear from the respondent.
The appellant has failed to persuade us that Mr. Justice Koch erred in any material respect.
In other words, we see no tenable basis for interfering with his decision.
[2] The debtor clearly committed an act of bankruptcy under ss. 42(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, as a result of the sheriff's return of nulla bona to the respondent's writ of execution against the debtor.
[3] That left Justice Koch to consider whether to dismiss the petition pursuant to ss. 43(7) of the Act or to stay proceedings on the petition pursuant to ss. 43(11).
[4] As for the first, the debtor did not satisfy Justice Koch that he was able to pay his debts or that there existed other sufficient cause to dismiss the petition.
Based on the evidence adduced by the debtor, we are of the view there is no basis to conclude that Mr. Justice Koch should have been satisfied of these matters.
[5] As for second, concerning ss. 43(11), we note that the subsection contains discretionary power to stay proceedings.
That, of course, serves to narrow the basis for intervention on appeal.
We cannot say Justice Koch erred in any requisite respect in the exercise of this discretionary power.
[6] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, with costs on appeal to the respondent to be taxed in the usual way."
480,"[1] The facts of this case, and the relevant provisions of the agreements in issue may be found in the reasons for judgment of the chambers judge, [2006 SKQB 154; [2006] S.J. No. 211] [2] All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement, which provides as follows: ARTICLE XIV TRANSFERS Section 14.01 RIGHT OF REFUSAL ON TRANSFERS If Party (denoted in this Article XIV as the ""Vendor"") shall wish to sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its Participating Interest in the Program Lands or Project Area (herein called the ""Offered Interest"") (the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all or part of its Participating Interest) at any time during the currency of this Agreement, the other Parties hereto then having Participating Interest in the Program Lands or Project Area affected (hereafter in this Section 14.01 called the ""Purchasers"") shall be entitled to right of refusal in respect thereof as follows: (a) the Vendor shall first obtain from third party or third parties, which may include another Party to this Agreement, (herein collectively called the “Third Party”) an irrevocable offer to purchase the Offered Interest for cash, subject to the rights of the Purchasers pursuant to this Article (herein called the “Third Party Offer”); (b) the Vendor shall give written notice (hereafter called the ""Offering Notice"") to the Purchasers of the Vendor's desire to sell.","All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement.
They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause.
It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'.
HELD: Appeal dismissed orally.
The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement.
However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal.
In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets.
Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole.
Accordingly, the voting agreement is not caught by subsection 14.01."
481,"[10] Counsel for the appellants submits that these fines, for total of $69,000, with consecutive default penalties for Alsager, offends the totality principle articulated in R. 26, M.V.R. 237, per MacKinnon A.C.J.O., Nadin‑Davis, Sentencing in Canada (1982), p.","DIGEST
The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors.
The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000.
HELD: 1)
The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents.
The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public.
The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry.
This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.
 2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000.
The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high.
Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'.
Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit.
3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed."
482,"HISTORY OF PROCEEDINGS [3] The following dates are relevant to this application: (a) May 19, 2004 the Information was sworn charging the accused; (b) May 19, 2004 the accused first appeared in court with Legal Aid as her counsel, was released on an Undertaking Given to Judge subject to number of restrictive conditions, and the Information was adjourned to September 8, 2004 for disclosure; (b.1) August 24, 2004 the defence forwarded Consent Order to the Crown authorizing opening of sealed Search Warrant and Information to Obtain, the edited copy of which was provided on November 2, 2004, only after counsel for the co-accused consented to the Order in late October 2004; (c) September 8, 2004 the Information was adjourned to October 6, 2004, and then to November 3, 2004, for defence election on Count 2; (d) November 3, 2004 defence election of Queen’s Bench Judge Alone made and then the Information was adjourned by the defence to November 17, 2004, then to December 8, 2004, then to February 23, 2005 (on which date reelection was made on Count to Provincial Court), and then to March 9, 2005, in each case to be spoken to; (e) March 9, 2005 not guilty plea was entered and the trial was set for September 28, 2005; (f) September 28, 2005 the Information was adjourned at defence request to October 19, 2005, then to October 26, 2005, then to November 19, 2005, and then to December 14, 2005, in each case to be spoken to; (g) December 14, 2005 new trial date was set for June 14, 2006; (h) June 14, 2006 the trial was adjourned to November 29, 2006 at Crown request, the Accused not waiving delay; (i) November 29, 2006 the trial was adjourned at Crown request due to the inability of some Crown witnesses able to travel to Buffalo Narrows in the bad weather, new trial date being set for January 19, 2007, the defence not waiving delay; (i.1) December 13, 2006 Charter motion argued and decision reserved to this date.","The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time.
HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.
 1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months.
The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable.
This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused.
6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court.
The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused.
3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial.
While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release.
4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached.
No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather."
483,"The petitioner seeks an interim order setting his ongoing child support obligation as well as addressing the arrears. The petitioner takes the position that he has overpaid by approximately $6,300.00 over the past four years if one compares his employment income to the corresponding table support under the Federal Child Support Guidelines (SOR/97-175, as am.) The Maintenance Enforcement Office is holding funds obtained through federal garnishment.","In January 1992, the parties agreed the petitioner would pay child support of $300 per month and that it would be without tax ramifications to either party.
As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900.
He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears.
The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines.
HELD: 1)
In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934.
The petitioner is actively engaged in farming.
He pursues reasonable off farm income.
In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income.
He shall pay child support of $221 per month.
 2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation.
It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992.
However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it.
He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years.
The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs.
By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay.
In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears."
484,"It is also argued that if the RRSP income is to be considered then her contribution to the support of the children should be reduced as the amount that she would be required to pay under the Variation Order and the Child Support Guidelines, that is to say the amount set off against the Respondent’s contribution, would cause her undue hardship.","The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally.
Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect.
The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income.
Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support.
She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find.
The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income.
Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue.
Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms."
485,"November 28, 2008 INTRODUCTION [1] The applicant, Barry Strange, operating under the trade name of Middle Lake Hotel 2002 (“the applicant”), brings an application seeking an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (“the Director”) and filed with this Court.","FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court.
The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal.
The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria.
HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing.
Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same.
2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing.
Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable.
A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures.
Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt.
This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346.
It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered.
The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction.
This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment.
3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.
 4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake.
It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him.
The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail.
This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least.
Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default.
In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court."
486,"However, the Trustee is entitled to something, if Ms. Smith and her children are to keep the horses. Surplus Income [57] According to the information provided in Ms. Smith’s affidavit and reviewed in Mr. Haley’s affidavit the following appears to be her best recent monthly income: VAC Pension $1,509.39 CPP Pension 1,466.36 Child Support 1,814.00 Superannuation Pension 374.35 Child Tax Benefit 937.79 $6,101.89 There are some months where it has been less because of less child support being received.","The Trustee opposed the bankrupt's application for a discharge on various grounds.
The bankrupt supported four children and had been discharged from the military due to illness arising from her active service.
The bankrupt will be entitled to an absolute discharge once certain conditions are met, including the payment of one month's rent, the value of the horses and surplus income for nine months to the Trustee.
The bankrupt's disability pension from Veterans' Affairs was not included in the calculation of surplus income as the public policy reason behind the exemption for proceeds received due to personal injury and a soldier's danger pay applied to this disability pension.
The Trustee had no claim to the insurance proceeds received by the bankrupt following the loss of her home by fire as it was a modest sum used to replace lost personal exempt assets; the three horses were found to be owned by the bankrupt as opposed to her children, for whom she had purchased them as pets and were included in the value of her estate; the court exercised its discretion in determining the amount of surplus income, noting that the administration of the estate had been unusually hostile and it was important that the bankrupt be able to stabilize her family finances."
487,There was further delay between the filing of RBC’s List of Documents and correspondence from Mr. Kimball in 2008 indicating that Mr. Burchell would be representing the Plaintiffs.,"The action, originally filed in 2000, concerned allegations of breach of - fiduciary duty, trust, industry regulations/standards, contract; and claims of negligence and malpractice.
These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant.
The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years.
The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars.
There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest).
The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim.
Application dismissed.
While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years).
While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant.
There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay.
After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here.
On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice.
There is a significant documentary record of the transactions.
The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner.
The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time.
While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice.
Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse."
488,Section 72(1) states: 72(1) Any person who is aggrieved by decision or order of hearing officer may appeal the decision or order on question of law or of jurisdiction to judge of the Court of Queen’s Bench within 30 days after the date of the decision or order. [8] The notice of appeal and arguments presented by the tenant all relate to the facts as found by the hearing officer.,"This is an appeal by the tenant, pursuant to s. 72 of the Residential Tenancies Act from a decision of the hearing officer appointed under the Act, who, pursuant to ss. 58, 68, and 70 of the Act, ordered that the landlord be given possession of the tenant's rental unit and that a writ of possession be issued to place the landlords in possession of the rental unit.
HELD: The Court reviewed the facts and found the tenant had not raised any true issues as to the jurisdiction of the hearing.
It was the Court's view that the hearing officer had jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter in issue.
The notice of appeal and arguments presented by the tenant all relate to the facts as found by the hearing officer and contain no error of law.
There were facts before the hearing officer to support his finding that the tenant had significantly disturbed other tenants.
Further, the Court found there was ample evidence to support the hearing officer's decision on all his findings of fact.
Appeal dismissed."
489,"[20] New s.6.1 was added by the 2007 amendments to the Act and it provides as follows: 6.1(1) The court may make any order it considers appropriate in an application to certify multi-jurisdictional class action, including the following: (a) an order certifying the action as multi-jurisdictional class action if: (i) the criteria set out in subsection 6(1) have been satisfied; and (ii) having regard to subsections 6(2) and (3), the court determines that Saskatchewan is the appropriate venue for the multi-jurisdictional class action; (b) an order refusing to certify the action if the court determines that if should proceed as multi-jurisdictional class action in another jurisdiction; (c) an order refusing to certify portion of proposed class if the members of that portion of the class contains members who may be included in pending or proposed class action in another jurisdiction.","FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act.
The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules.
The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick.
To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG).
MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent.
Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference.
Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced.
The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process.
They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money.
The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick.
The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process.
HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed.
1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.
 'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act.
The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications.
They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses.
The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad.
That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act.
That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction.
The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act.
The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed.
They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted.
2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case.
There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions.
That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed."
490,"160, does provide direction about the relationship between parents and their children and directs: 18(4) Subject to this Act, the father and mother of child are joint guardians and are equally entitled to the care and custody of the child unless otherwise (a) provided by the Guardianship Act; or (b) ordered by court of competent jurisdiction.","The parties' hostility prevented them from reaching an agreement on interim parenting arrangements for their two-and-a-half-year-old child.
There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months).
The mother had nothing positive to say about him.
They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child.
He agreed to abstain from drugs around the child and for 12 hours before access.
The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country.
Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access.
The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs.
There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy.
There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk.
Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so.
While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis."
491,"Parties’ Position on Appeal [9] The father argues that the Chambers judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children test by considering only the impact of the change in circumstances when making her determination, by failing to apply the principle of maximum contact, by applying a presumption of the status quo and by finding that evidence as to the wishes of the children was irrelevant.","The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment.
The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below.
The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant.
For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances.
No error was made on this issue.
The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz.
The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting.
She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests.
There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them.
The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children.
There is no material error or misapprehension of the evidence."
492,"In the statement of claim and in their motion the plaintiffs seek:   (1) a mandatory interlocutory injunction requiring defendants to make the retroactive adjustment payments before the end of this year; (2) in the alternative, a mandatory interlocutory injunction to compel the defendants to make the payments before the end of this year on a “best approximation” basis; (3) in the further alternative, an order requiring the parties to proceed with an expedited arbitration before an arbitrator appointed by the court.","Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement.
The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year.
This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates.
In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration.
The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.
HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme.
The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed.
While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case.
While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages.
It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations.
It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation.
The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties."
493,"[18] Medusa has also commenced separate action against Boone and Bough, alleging that their initial application is an attempt at enforcement in violation or in breach of clauses 2.2.2 and 3.1 of the Debenture Agreements.","motion dismissed.
There are factors that suggest there is a presumption in favor of proceeding by way of an application (Rule 6.02(3)).
The respondent failed to show that, on balance, an action is the preferable route.
While not all of the witnesses will be ascertained quickly, the important ones can be, which is all that Rule 6.03(5)(a) requires.
The hearing should be predictable in scope and length and ready to be heard within months.
The issues are straightforward.
The only thing that would cause delay is the intended counterclaim."
494,"[10] In considering the situation of the Applicants, the Chambers judge concluded that the delay from 1991 to 1998 (when the University’s insurer was prosecuting the action) was not problematic. even though it too had progressed to a very late stage in the litigation, (b) he improperly discounted the fact that many of their key witnesses would be unable to testify due to death or mental and physical disability and failed to properly assess the prejudice that they would suffer if they are forced to proceed to trial, (c) he improperly discounted the problems they will face in obtaining appropriate expert evidence so many years after the work in issue was done, (d) more specifically, he wrongly discounted the importance of their difficulty in finding expert witnesses by saying the University would face the same problems, and (e) he failed to give sufficient or any weight to the overall delay, i.e. from 1991 to 2010, in considering whether it was in the interests of justice for the case to proceed to trial.","The applicants applied for leave to appeal from a Chambers decision denying their application to dismiss the respondent's claim against them for want of prosecution.
The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan.
The building was substantially completed in 1970.
In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building.
In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss.
In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief.
In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer.
The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997.
Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held.
In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution.
The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant.
HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant.
Secondly, the issue of delays in litigation is important and the case will present an opportunity for the Court to clarify the legal framework pertaining to such matters."
495,"In that regard, the officer had no problem with Legal Aid duty counsel being counsel of choice if the accused had been told he has the right to contact any lawyer he wishes. Ct., Whelan J.) Among the issues considered therein was rights to counsel and the proper procedures to be used by the police and Courts in an analysis of this matter, including consideration of how the onus will shift from the accused to the Crown.","The accused asserted that his rights to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached because the police officer did not bring a list of lawyers to the accused's attention and the accused did not have access to it.
The officer may not have drawn the presence of a telephone book to the accused's attention.
The officer dialed the number for Legal Aid duty counsel for the accused and the accused spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel prior to providing breath samples of 190 milligrams and 180 milligrams.
The accused never indicated that he wished to contact other counsel.
HELD: Following a voir dire, the accused's application to exclude evidence was dismissed.
The accused had not succeeded in establishing on a balance of probabilities that the accused's right to consult counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been violated.
The accused was entirely disinterested in consulting with counsel as was his right and was clear and unequivocal in his waiver of rights to counsel.
Alternatively, the accused failed to indicate a desire to exercise his right to counsel."
496,"Another police officer took control of the Accused and it is of some note that the Accused at that time was described as: “Not so much belligerent at that point, but didn’t really believe that he had done anything […]Road, didn’t believe we really had reasons to deal with him.” [10] The officers handcuffed Mr. Keil and searched him, retrieving a fob that operates the locks on the doors of a vehicle and some keys from the Accused’s pocket.","The accused's neighbour disliked the accused and alleged that the accused drove his vehicle into hers.
The police arrested the accused and found a fob that operated the locks on the doors of the vehicle and the engine hood of the accused's vehicle was warm.
The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving.
HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges.
The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous.
The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle."
497,Position of Mr. Gamble [3] That the evidence does not meet the statutory requirements of dangerous offender designation and that long-term offender designation is the appropriate finding with term of imprisonment from four to eight years in penitentiary for the predicate offence followed by lengthy supervision order toward the statutory maximum. 753.(4)(b) of the Criminal Code that Mr. Gamble be supervised in the community for a period of nine years from the date of his release; c) There will be an order under s.,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section.
The Crown brought a dangerous offender application.
The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing.
His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions.
The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang.
The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy.
The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang.
He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation.
The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth.
The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary.
While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody.
The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated.
HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code.
The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang.
The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i).
Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently.
The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii).
The accused was declared a dangerous offender.
However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public.
In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated.
The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b)."
498,"November 6, 2013 [1] The applicants, Jean Richer and Leslie Sinobert, (hereinafter referred to as “Richer” and/or “Sinobert”) have brought an application for writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, seeking unconditional release from the Riverbend Minimum Institution in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, due to “threat” to their respective liberties claiming that the Correctional Service of Canada has violated their rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the “Charter”) in not allowing them to reside in common housing unit so that they can participate in their long-standing, same-sex relationship outside of the public domain.","HELD: The Court dismissed the application.
It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction.
The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus.
These remedies were available only through the Federal Court."
499,"Andrychuk Q.C. for the respondent JUDGMENT WHITMORE J.A. November 14, 2013 Ex officio INTRODUCTION [1] This is an application for judicial review of decision of The Workers’ Compensation Board (the “Board”) denying the applicant reimbursement for the cost of the applicant’s medical marihuana.","HELD: The application was dismissed.
With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it.
It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable.
The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective.
In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex;
and 4) that there was no evidence that the board based its decision on irrelevant considerations such as the potential political ramifications of paying for medical marijuana."
500,"Universities may operate without it and some historically did so, albeit at their peril in terms of their reputation and ability to recruit; (c) tenure provisions, and more specifically the process by which tenure is achieved, are sometimes set unilaterally by Universities, sometimes negotiated as extra contractual policies (sometimes in the form described as “frozen policies”) and sometimes negotiated as part of collective agreement; (d) tenure is sometimes referred to expressly in the statute creating the particular University and sometimes not; (e) tenure usually involves formal approval or granting process beyond the simple judgment by one’s peers, but there is little uniformity as to whether this involves an official like the President or Governing Board, and little uniformity as to when appeals or arbitration is available, and if so, as to which point in the decision-making process any such appeal or right to arbitrate relates.","HELD: The application was dismissed.
The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness.
Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly.
Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public.
The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past.
The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout.
To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn.
The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable."
501,"[19] According to Ms. J., she continued to be primarily responsible for Z.’s care and more so after Mr. S. She testified that she arranges the activities so that they are scheduled on days that do not conflict with Mr. S.’s time with Z. She testified that after Z.’s birth Ms. J. testified that after the separation he has supported Z.’s relationship with Ms. J.","The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons.
The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness.
The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner.
By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother.
The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times.
To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997.
The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth.
The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent.
The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child.
The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent.
The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home.
The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs.
The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care.
The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future.
The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent.
The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner.
The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties.
The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend.
The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction.
After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses.
The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property.
The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years.
The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.
 The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home.
The value of the home was $360,000.
The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home.
The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties.
After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act.
The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment.
Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid."
502,"[23] Mr. Foster’s counsel filed written submissions at the sentencing hearing in which he described the offence as follows at p. [59] The Crown takes the position that “but for Debigare”, four year sentence for Mr. Manulak and Mr. Foster on the break and enter would be appropriate with slightly lesser sentence for Mr. Hill.","HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation.
The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him.
The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years.
The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth.
The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation.
A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge.
All accused were given an 18-month probation period to follow their incarceration.
Terms of the probation included counselling as required and no contact with the victim."
503,"4: Where person or court is required by any provision of this Act other than subsection 49(2) to determine the best interests of child, the person or court shall take into account: (a) the quality of the relationships that the child has with any person who may have close connection with the child; (b) the child’s physical, mental and emotional level of development; (c) the child’s emotional, cultural, physical, psychological and spiritual needs; (d) the home environment proposed to be provided for the child; (e) the plans for the care of the child of the person to whom it is proposed that the custody of the child be entrusted; (f) where practicable, the child’s wishes, having regard to the age and level of the child’s development; (g) the importance of continuity in the child’s care and the possible effect on the child of disruption of that continuity; and (h) the effect on the child of delay in making decision. 37(1) is appropriate, including conditions which could be attached, the court must be satisfied either: (a)The parent or parents have altered his or her ways such that the circumstances which gave rise to the determination that the child was in need of protection no longer exist, or (b)The court is satisfied that there is realistic plan or reasonable basis upon which to conclude that the necessary changes can occur within reasonable time whereby the children can be safely returned to the care of their parent or parents.","HELD: The order was granted.
Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act.
As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands.
Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care.
Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order."
504,"HAL takes the position that the agreements signed with SecurTek, although not specifically referring to right of appeal on such basis, contain an implied condition that permits the parties to appeal arbitrators’ decisions, with leave, on the basis of errors in law.","HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed.
The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair.
The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration.
Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law."
505,"However, Cst. Howell swears that this information will also provide evidence of the accused’s “obsession with massage porn.” [38] The point of this voir dire is not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context.","The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography.
The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant.
She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence.
The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO).
The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility.
The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography.
The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”.
The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment.
The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower.
The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos.
The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs.
The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused.
The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant.
The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone.
The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).
The application proceeded by voir dire.
The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire.
The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device.
| HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained.
Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights.
The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search.
The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established.
Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement.
The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities.
Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant.
The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record; 
2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means.
This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search.
It was not admitted;
3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context.
There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant;
4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety.
However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence;
5) The ITO provided sufficient description.
It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO.
Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and 
6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence.
The ITO sought only the search history."

The judgment was set aside and the defendant given leave to file its statement of defence.
The court found that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right because it was in excess of the amount due.
The judgment was also set aside on the merits.
It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action.

 -  18 months for theft and 12 months concurrent for mischief upheld on appeal."
508,"am of the opinion that the trial judge did not properly direct himself as to the type of evidence necessary to conclude, as result of the respondent's degree of intoxication, that there was reasonable doubt that the respondent had the minimal intent required for the general intent offence of common assault.",", The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife.
The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault.
Allowing the appeal,
that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity.
The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward.
The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'."
509,"In his ""interpretation' of the Act Dr. Waller concluded that it applied to the situation before him for two reasons: (a) Armoyan lands had opened ditch on its own lands ""...to enable better use of their lands and to continue to provide drainage to upstream land...at their expense in accordance with their interest"", and (b) Armoyan seeks ""...to open ditch on the property of the Haverstock Estate, and are prepared to pay for the same because it is in accordance with their interest."" Dr. Waller's conclusions as to the respective legal rights of the parties under the Act are as follows: (2) According to Section 5(2), Armoyan Properties are required to continue ditch or drain to proper outlet, and entitled to construct it through the Haverstock lands to proper outlet.","The respondent had undertaken the residential development of certain lands bordering the appellant's property and constructed roadways which it proposed to convey to the Department of Transportation, who agreed to accept with the consent of owners of property where water would drain from the road.
When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement.
The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer.
The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions.
In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act.
Allowing the appeal,
that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost.
However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch.
Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems."

The picketers were completely blocking the entrance to the construction site, were threatening the occupants of vehicles using the entrance and damaged one vehicle as it entered the site.
No City employees were working on the site.
ISSUES: 1)Is the picketing secondary picketing?
2)Is the manner of picketing unlawful in any event?
HELD: Application allowed.
1)Picketing of the premises of an employer, where there is no direct dispute between him and the picketers or between him and his employees, is secondary picketing, is per se unlawful and cannot be jusified merely because the picketers are engaged in a legal strike against another employer who has business relations with the employer being picketed.
2)If the court had determined that the subject picketing was not secondary picketing, then, in the particular circumstances it would still have held that the subject picketing was unlawful, and ought to be restrained, as, on the whole of said evidence it was satisfied that the applicant had established that said picketing was not being carried on for the purpose of lawful communication, but, rather, was being carried on in a manner designed to obstruct, impede and interfere with the lawful performance by the applicant of its construction contract on the construction site."
512,"Council continued to take the view that private use structures, such as boathouses, on public reserves violated Sec. 197, and that they must prosecute the builders of them if they were to fulfil their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure that public reserve lands were, in fact, open for use by the general public.","The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay.
They contended the bylaws were inapplicable.
They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter.
Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province.
This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983.
Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners.
Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal.
In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983.
The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197.
The province had no policing mechanism for violations.
The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title.
In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve.
They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot.
Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department.
This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw.
On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure.
Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility.
Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities.
In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves.
Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments.
They received no response and issued an order.
Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking.
Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves.
On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP.
The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution.
The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act.
On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils.
Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992.
On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991.
The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not.
On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action.
Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes.
Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use.
The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted.
Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion.
If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court.
If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense.
Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private.
The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter.
HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197.
Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval.
The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority.
The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land.
Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve.
It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution.
The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter.
How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197.
John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197.
The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction.
If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies.
An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective.
The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility.
It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times.
If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators.
This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use.
They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act.
The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter.
Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations.
To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit.
A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law.
They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position.
Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances.
The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out.
There was no such evidence.
Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski).
The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution.
In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'.
In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'.
Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'.
The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'.
The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation.
The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators.
The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners.
Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it.
The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides.
The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action.
The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed.
Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants.
Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council.
The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid.
The delay by the province occurred pre-charge.
There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process.
Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination.
It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles.
It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.
 'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted.
Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15.
The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews).
This case should not be read so broadly.
In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter."

514,The Plaintiff further states that the Defendant Dow Chemical is at law responsible for the liabilities of Dow Corning with respect to silicone breast implants.,"FIAT. The plaintiff brought an action against five defendants claiming fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a skin rash were the result of silicone implants.
One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside.
Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause.
It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.
 1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law.
The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province.
2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort.
Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary.
3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties.
4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity.
It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical.
This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship.
If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection.
5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.
 6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered.
Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96."

HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.
 1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1).
There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit.
S146(1) is a self-contained formula.
3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1).
The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis.
4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1).
5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid."

The appellant raises the following ground of appeal: ""Did the learned trial judge err in concluding that the Crown had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt?"" Specifically, it is submitted by the appellant that the Crown did not prove that the appellant ""distributed"" the copyrighted material, that the appellant had the requisite knowledge, or that the distribution was to an extent that it prejudicially affected the owners of the copyrights.","The appellant appealed his conviction of distributing infringing copies of three computer programs.
He argued that the Crown did not prove that he had distributed the copyrighted material, or that the distribution was to an extent that it prejudicially affected the owners of the copyrights.
Dismissing the appeal,
that by placing the copyrighted computer pro-grams on his computer bulletin board in a compressed format, for ease of transmission, and allowing access by modem to the programs, the appellant was distributing the programs to the prejudice of the owner's copyright."
517,"2(d) of The Environmental Assessment Act. Development is defined term under that Act. It is defined as follows: (d) “development” means any project, operation or activity or any alteration or expansion of any project, operation or activity which is likely to: (I) have an affect on any unique, rare or endangered feature of the environment; (ii) substantially utilize any provincial resource and in so doing pre‑empt the use, or potential use, of that resource for any other purpose; (iii) cause the emission of any pollutants or create by‑products, residual or waste products which require handling and disposal in manner that is not regulated by any other Act or regulation; (iv) cause widespread public concern because of potential environmental changes; (v) involve new technology that is concerned with resource utilization and that may induce significant environmental change; or (vi) have significant impact on the environment or necessitate further development which is likely to have significant impact on the environment.","The respondents applied for a declaration that the intensive livestock operation being constructed by Kelvington (KSS) was a development pursuant to s2(d) of the Environmental Assessment Act (EAA) and sought an order for mandamus compelling KSS to conduct an environmental assessment as required by s9 of the EAA.
Yellow Quill First Nation applied for intervenor status.
The trial judge found, without giving reasons, that the project was a development as defined in the Environmental Assessment Act and the application for mandamus was adjourned sine die.
HELD: The appeal was granted and the order set aside without costs.
1)The proposal was not a development as defined in s 2(d) of the EAA.
The Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment and Resource Management were of the opinion that the KSS project was not a development as defined in the Act as it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s2(d).
2)The Environmental Assessment Branch was of the opinion that no significant impacts on the environment would occur or if they do, mitigation measures would be implemented to reduce or eliminate the potential for significant environmental impact.
 3)It was not necessary to decide whether Yellow Quill or the respondents had standing to privately enforce a public right. 4)In light of the decision the following were not in issue: whether the respondent should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari; the relationship between the Environmental Assessment and Agricultural Operations Act; and whether a proponent of an intensive livestock operation can be required to make an application under the Agricultural Operations Act and to carry out an environmental impact assessment under s9 of the EAA."
518,"The trial judge, in response to the Crown’s argument the retruns were false and the records and record keeping were part of an elaborate scheme of deception to avoid taxes, stated “It is also consistent with simple sloppiness.” The appeal judge stated, “In my opinion, there is some question as to whether either accused willfully evaded the payment of income tax, or whether there was any intent to make statement knowing it to be false or deceptive.","Both accused appealed the decision of the Summary Conviction Appeal Court Judge ordering a new trial on seven counts under s239(1)(a) and (d) of the Income Tax Act relating to evasion of payment of taxes and unlawfully making of a false or deceptive statement.
The appeal judge decided the trial judge erred in failing to determine if the payments involved were income and in focusing only on the criminal intent of the accused.
HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittals ordered by the trial judge were restored.
There was no basis to overturn the findings of fact made by the trial judge.
The appeal judge misinterpreted the decision of the trial judge who properly considered the issue of income before dealing with mens rea.
The evidence of taxability was not clear-cut, obvious or indisputable."
519,"[8] The trial judge found that Lanson had not authorized the sale to Spruce Meadow Trucking Ltd. He, in effect, found that Lanson, the secured party had to authorize the buyer, Spruce Meadow Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization.","The issue on appeal was reduced to whether the security holder, Lanson, authorized Nickel to sell the mobile home as contemplated by s28(1) or, if not authorized, did he sell the mobile home in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s30(2).
Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home.
The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full.
Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson.
The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds.
Lanson attempted to seize the home.
The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.
 HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet.
The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security.
2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization.
Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral.
The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full.
3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale.
Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale.
The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.
 4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds.
There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party.
5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing.
It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer.
The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.
 6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V."
520,"At the intersection of Albert Street and 1st Avenue, approximately three blocks from the accident, both vehicles were stopped, Mr. Black in the left driving lane and the black Volkswagen driven by Mr. Delaittre in the right driving lane. Trevor Leibel Trevor Leibel was passenger in Mr. Delaittre's vehicle and indicates that Mr. Delaittre sped up to keep up with the Audi and that at the time of the accident, the accused had run out of room and had to go to the right lane to avoid hitting the cars which were in front of them in the driving lanes.","The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community.
Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself.
Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian.
The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other.
HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed.
Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre.
An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course.
He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.
 1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death.
It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death.
Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences.
2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident.
Alcohol was not involved.
He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately.
Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered.
3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences.
The accused had six speeding convictions.
He had a minor youth record involving mischief."
521,"The taxpayer, Canada Trust, had no cause of action for return of any overpayment of taxes until the appeal provisions of the Assessment Act, supra had been exhausted and resulted in reduced assessment.","The plaintiff paid its municipal property taxes as assessed for three years.
On appeal it was held to be entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total amount of $420,000.
The plaintiff, pursuant to s. 41(I) of the Judicature Act, sought payment of interest on this amount from the date of the payments.
Awarding 5 months interest,
that the date from which interest is calculated in this type of action is upon completion of the appeal process.
An appropriate interest claim under s. 41(I) therefore only exists for the five month period between the Court of Appeal's assessment determination and the refund of the property tax five months later."
522,"Section provides: 8(1) On application by claimant, the Court of Queen’s Bench may make an interim or final order restraining the disposition or wasting of assets that would impair or defeat claim pursuant to this Act.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action.
The respondent applies to have the order set aside.
The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders.
He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction.
The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act.
HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act.
Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security.
For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him.
The parties may apply to vary this amount in future.
Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance.
The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act.
If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act.
As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations.
Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act.
The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim.
When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose."
523,"In that defence, paragraph reads that: “The Defendant pleads and relies on the Statute of Limitations (in Nova Scotia) and notes that the motor vehicle accident, which forms the subject matter of the Statement of Claim herein, is said to have occurred on the 12th day of August, 1972, now over 25 years ago.” An affidavit was filed by the plaintiff, Flora Burt, in support of this application in which she attests that the first time she became aware that the driver of the car at the time of the accident was or may have been Howard LeLacheur, rather than her deceased husband, Vincent LeLacheur, was in February of 1997 when she was so informed by family member named Kelly LeLacheur, who was in turn informed by another family member that this information had been revealed to him by Howard LeLacheur.","The deceased was killed in a single car accident in 1972, leaving his wife, the plaintiff, who was pregnant with the second plaintiff, his daughter, as his survivors.
In 1997, the plaintiffs first learned through other family members that the defendant, a nephew of the deceased, had revealed to them that it was actually he who was the driver of the car at the time of the accident.
They brought an action under the provisions of the Fatal Injuries Act.
This was an application to disallow the limitation defence raised by Judgment Recovery on behalf of the defendant.
Dismissing the application without costs,
that the limitation as prescribed by the Act is twelve months, which the plaintiffs had clearly exceeded.
This time period is without regard to the injured party's knowledge of whether or not a claim exists."
524,"Conclusions [112] In my opinion, Justice Tidman erred when he: - concluded that all questions of law, including questions where the law is clear, should not be brought before the Court in a s.14.25 application; - determined that the constitutional question posed by Future Inns had not yet been clearly answered by the courts; - determined that the extent of the immunity of the Labour Relations Board, and its members, except for the allegations against chairman Darby, was unclear.","The appellants motion to strike the respondent's statement of claim was dismissed on the ground that questions of law are not matters to be brought before the court on an application to strike.
The Chambers judge also accepted the respondent's submission that the extent of the immunity of administrative boards and their members from actions such as this based on their alleged malice and bad faith is, as yet, unclear in Canada.
Allowing the appeal in part,
that the Chambers judge erred when he concluded that all questions of law, including questions where the law is clear, should not be brought before the court in an application to strike, when he concluded that the constitutional question posed by the respondent had not yet been answered by the courts, and when he determined that the extent of the immunity of the appellant Board and its members, except for the Chair, was unclear.
The appeal was allowed with respect to the action against the Board and the individual members, apart from the Chair."
525,"[10] The appellant had argued before the Board of Revision and before the Assessment Appeals Committee that various expansions of the mall, over the years, to meet the requirements of various new tenants resulted in an excess of non revenue producing common area, and superadequate (and costly) underground parking, and that these things, because they detracted from the economic utility of the premises amounted to abnormal functional obsolescence within the meaning of the manual.","An appeal under s.33.1 of the Municipal Board Act from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board, one in a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor (MAF) to assessments for municipal tax purposes.
In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city.
HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual.
Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal.
3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed.
Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision.
The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case.
The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.
 4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided."
526,"Q.B.), the court referred to various authorities which have considered the issue of reasonable and probable grounds for the demand, at paragraph 64: ""Cases in which an investigating officer's observations of the accused's physical comportment have been held inadequate to justify the making of 254(3) demand include: R. R. 44 (Q.B.), Chief Justice MacPherson found that where the investigating officer had no reasonable and probable grounds for making breath sample demand, the accused's rights under s.9 of the Charter were breached and the evidence obtained from that breach should be excluded pursuant to s.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively.
Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt.
The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes.
HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges.
1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter.
The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means.
Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt.
2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand.
The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole.
Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances.
It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes.
The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents.
The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card.
The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking.
3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment.
The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case."
527,"The parties agree that since the summer of 1994 the land qualifies as farm land under the Act, and the house located on the property since that time has been homestead within the meaning of the Act. Where the parties disagree was whether the property was the respondents' homestead when s. If this time does not allow the respondents to resolve the debt, by sale of the property or refinancing, then the respondents shall have the onus on the return date of providing evidence why the upset price suggested by the applicant should not be included in an order nisi for sale.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order nisi for sale of a 10 acre parcel of land on which the respondents operate an ostrich farming business.
The amount owing on the mortgage was $61,194.91 as of February 12.
In issue was whether the home was a homestead within the meaning of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act when s.44(17) was proclaimed on September 20, 1992.
HELD: The application was adjourned to June 7.
1)The homestead provisions of s.44 had no application in this case.
The land was not being put to any farming use prior to August 1992 and the respondent's house at the time fell into the category of 'simply a dwelling in isolation' (Bank of Nova Scotia v. Blair).
2)There was no recent appraisal information available.
If the respondents have not resolved the debt by sale or refinancing by the return date they will have the onus of providing evidence that the upset price suggested by the applicant should not be included in an order nisi for sale."
528,"However, R.v. Bottrell (1981), 1981 CanLII 339 (BC CA), 60 C.C.C.(2d) 211 (B.C.C.A), for the purposes of s.25(3), at p.217 defines the term “grievous bodily harm” as “causing hurt or pain.” Consequently, in assessing his conduct to determine the applicability of s.34 (1), considered, along with my other impressions of the witnesses as they testified, the following: (a) the accused invited the complainant into the basement to wrestle where they had an unsatisfactory and unresolved contact; (b) on his own testimony, the accused met the complainant in the hallway upstairs where the complainant, still upset, stuck him in the face despite Veinot’s efforts to prevent them from fighting; (c) the accused heard the complainant and Veinot arguing in Veinot’s room and the complainant angrily shouting threats at him from Veinot’s room but with the door closed; (d) without any invitation or reasonable justification, the accused entered Veinot’s room to confront the complainant; (e) the complainant suffered nasal fracture during the melee.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm.
The complainant willingly took part in a fight club after which the accused followed him and engaged in a second physical altercation with him.
During the fight, the parties fell into a dresser, onto the floor and out a window.
At some stage of the fight, the complainant sustained a nasal fracture, which was the basis of the charge.
Accused not guilty of assault causing bodily harm.
The confrontation between the accused and the complainant was one continuing episodic event and the complainant's actions were provoked by the accused.
However, no causal relationship was shown between the blows of the accused and the broken nose sustained by the complainant.
There were too many variables and probabilities as to how the complainant's nose might have become broken."
529,"Sobeys opposes the application for an interim injunction on the grounds that the evidence does not establish grounds for permanent injunction at the required threshold, that the plaintiffs have not established that they will suffer harm not compensable in damages if their claim is right and if interim relief is not given, and that the balance of inconvenience is with Sobeys not Shoppers Drug Mart or its licensee. I will dismiss the application for an interim injunction on the basis that neither Shoppers Drug Mart nor M.C. LeBlanc have established irreparable harm.","The defendant had a 25 year lease in a shopping centre which provided that the defendant would only use the premises for the purposes of the business of the retail sale of a complete line of food products, as well as general merchandising, as carried out by the rest of the majority of its stores.
The defendant proposed to open a pharmacy on the premises.
Another tenant in the shopping centre already operated a drug store and their lease provided that no other tenant would operate a drug store in any part of their premises.
The other tenant brought an application for a interim injunction against the defendant.
The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises.
The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial.
Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration."
530,"DNA Warrants Analysis of Section 487.05 of the Criminal Code [5] Section 487.05(1) of the Code provides: 487.05(1) provincial court judge who on ex parte application made in form 5.01 is satisfied by information on oath that there are reasonable grounds to believe (a) that designated offence has been committed, (b) that bodily substance has been found or obtained (i) at the place where the offence was committed, (ii) on or within the body of the victim of the offence, (iii) on anything worn or carried by the victim at the time when the offence was committed, or (iv) on or within the body of any person or thing or at any place associated with the commission of the offence, (c) that person was party to the offence, and (d) that forensic DNA analysis of bodily substance from the person will provide evidence about whether the bodily substance referred to in paragraph (b) was from that person and who is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the administration of justice to do so may issue warrant in Form 5.02 authorizing the taking, from that person, for the purpose of forensic DNA analysis, of any number of samples of one or more bodily substances that is reasonably required for that purpose, by means of the investigative procedures described in subsection 487.06(1).","The Crown applied for three DNA warrants pursuant to s.487.05 of the Criminal Code.
Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result.
The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155.
The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation.
'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable.
Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed.
Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a).
2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations.
The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable.
There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking.
The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out.
The paragraphing format was confusing.
3)A DNA warrant application would be premature.
The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood.
It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained.
It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now."
531,"[2] The appellant appealed his conviction on following grounds:  a) The learned trial Judge misdirected herself in finding, if she did so find, that the [sic] there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the Appellant’s ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug;  b) The learned trial Judge drew an incorrect inference from the facts at trial, in finding that the Appellant’s ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug;  c) The learned trial Judge failed to give a correct legal effect to the facts that she found, including, inter alia, the lack of evidence or indicia of impairment of the Appellant, at the material time that the Appellant was found to have care or control of a motor vehicle.","An appeal of conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (Criminal Code s.255 and s.253) on the grounds of misdirection in finding there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to impairment; an incorrect inference and failure to give correct legal effect to the facts as found including the lack of evidence of impairment at the material time while he was in care or control of the vehicle.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence.
Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence.
The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.
 2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838).
However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba).
A properly instructed jury could have arrived at the same inference on the facts as found."

Section Search or Seizure [40] Section of the Charter provides that, “Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.” [41] Section 495 of the Criminal Code of Canada provides: 495.(1) peace officer may arrest without warrant (a) person who has committed an indictable offence or who, on reasonable grounds, he believes has committed or is about to commit an indictable offence, (b) person whom he finds committing criminal offence, or [42] find that Constable Wilson observed what he reasonably believed to be marihuana leaves in the bottom of the accused’s purse.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and four other charges related to her attempts to evade arrest.
At the onset of her trial, the accused took the position that her s. 8, s. 9 and s. 10 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all the evidence obtained after the stop should be excluded.
HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached.
1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest.
2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there.
3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay."
533,"(1) judge shall order the committal of the person into custody to await surrender if (a) in the case of person sought for prosecution, there is evidence admissible under this Act of conduct that, had it occurred in Canada, would justify committal for trial in Canada on the offence set out in the authority to proceed and the judge is satisfied that the person is the person sought by the extradition partner; [3] Each party has filed a motion as follows:  (1) a motion dated September 9, 2003 on behalf of the Deputy Attorney General of Canada representing the USA for an order fixing a date for the hearing of the extradition request in this Court.

A date for the extradition hearing was set."
534,"Dellapinna Heard: November 3, 2003 and January 21, 2004, in Halifax, Nova Scotia (Supplementary Decision on Costs) Counsel: William Leahey, for the Petitioner By the Court: [1] After releasing my decision in this matter on March 8, 2004 but before an order from that decision was issued, the Court received from Mr. Crouse letter dated March 25, 2004 in which he stated, among other things, that he was not served with the Applicant’s application and supporting material.","After the court released its decision but before an order was issued, the court received a letter from the respondent in which it was stated that he had not been served with the applicant's application and supporting material.
The applicant had previously provided the court with a sworn Affidavit of Service indicating otherwise.
The respondent was provided with the judge's assistant's name and phone number and given a date by which he was to contact the assistant.
The assistant was not contacted but the respondent sent a second letter to the court enclosing a document entitled 'Affidavit' which again stated that he had not been informed of when the hearing was to take place.
A telephone conference was arranged but the court was unable to contact the respondent at the set time despite numerous calls and messages from the court.
The applicant now sought additional costs due to the time counsel had taken to prepare for the telephone conference.
Affidavit of the respondent struck; applicant entitled to additional costs in the amount of $250.
The court was not convinced that the respondent had not received adequate notice of the hearing and because he did not make himself available for cross- examination, his affidavit was struck."
535,"3. Did the Board, by means of subpoena duces tecum and its two document production orders, act without jurisdiction by in effect compelling Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents in contravention of the previous rulings of the Saskatchewan courts that the Board was without jurisdiction to do so?","Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board.
The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents.
Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done.
Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional.
HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW.
The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back.
1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.
 2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness.
3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects.
First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce.
The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced.
There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy.
It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed.
Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents.
The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it.
It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations.
4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did.
The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders.
The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.
 5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination.
It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6)
Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation.
Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue.
Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made.
7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal.
If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant.
The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.
 8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter.
Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways.
First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW.
If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights.
If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional.
However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter."
536,"[4] The appeal centers upon the adjudicator’s acceptance of Constable Napier’s evidence and the reliability of the evidence, i.e., his glimpse of the appellant driving his auto as a sole occupant while unlicensed versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant was not the driver of the vehicle but that his son was.","The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended.
The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle.
Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal entered.
The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle.
But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him."
537,"(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the court shall have regard to the following: (a) any written agreement between the spouses or between one or both spouses and third party; (b) the length of time that the spouses have cohabited; (c) the duration of the period during which the spouses have lived separate and apart; (d) the date when the family property was acquired; (e) the contribution, whether financial or in some other form, made directly or indirectly by third party on behalf of spouse to the acquisition, disposition, operation, management or use of the family property; (f) any direct or indirect contribution made by one spouse to the career or career potential of the other spouse; (g) the extent to which the financial means and earning capacity of each spouse have been affected by the responsibilities and other circumstances of the spousal relationship; (h) the fact that spouse has made: (i) substantial gift of property to third party; or (ii) transfer of property to third party other than bona fide purchaser for value; (i) previous distribution of family property between the spouses by gift or agreement or pursuant to an order of any court of competent jurisdiction made before or after the coming into force of this Act or The Miscellaneous Statutes (Domestic Relations) Amendment Act, 2001 (No. 2); (j) tax liability that may be incurred by spouse as result of the transfer or sale of family property or any order made by the court; (k) the fact that spouse has dissipated family property; (l) subject to subsection 30(3), any benefit received or receivable by the surviving spouse as result of the death of his or her spouse; (m) any maintenance payments payable for the support of child; (n) interests of third parties in the family property; (o) any debts or liabilities of spouse, including debts paid during the course of the spousal relationship; (p) the value of family property situated outside Saskatchewan; (q) any other relevant fact or circumstance.","This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act.
The couple had lived together for several years.
She sought judgment distributing their property.
The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents.
The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents.
The respondent appealed.
HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority.
Lane J.A. wrote in dissent.
Majority: 1)
The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship.
The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act.
There are a number of facts that merit emphasis.
The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started.
He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced.
He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced.
By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000.
2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property.
There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point.
The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete.
He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act.
On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property.
The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage.
Minority: 1)
The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act.
The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together.
In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2)
The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents.
He made a finding the loans were statute-barred.
The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent.
He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid.
He simply used less than precise language."

Accordingly, there shall be an order that Mr. Alm immediately pay to Ms. Aaston his 66% share, being $74.18 of Kristin’s dental expenses incurred prior to October 1, 2005.","FIAT: The sole issue before the court is the amount to be fixed for the ongoing s. 7 expenses.
The s. 7 expenses claimed by the petitioner include dental work of $112.90 for Kristen, orthodontic work for Brina and costs associated with Brina's post-secondary education.
It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities that necessitate certain tools such as a computer for her to be successful in her post-secondary training.
HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses and there shall be an order accordingly.
2) The September 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina's s. 7 expenses.
Accordingly the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s. 7 costs.
2) The crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on Brina's part and will assist her with her future plans.
3) The Zeller's supplies would normally be covered under the Table support and that expense is disallowed.
4) Brina's s. 7 post-secondary expenses are $7,123.72 and include tuition, crisis prevention class and books, required university books, bus pass, black cartridge for the printer, Shaw internet, Microsoft licence, computer repairs and updated virus protection."
539,"She objects to the grant of Orders of Production for the following records: a) The complete record and file of the Capital Health Addiction Prevention Treatment Services; b) The complete medical record, file and chart of the Nova Scotia Hospital, including but not limited to Dr. C’s assessment and psychiatric consult and the Respondent’s subsequent referral to Mental Health Services; c) The complete medical records and files of Dr. and Dr. D, the Respondent’s family physician’s; d) The complete medical record, file and chart of the QEII Health Sciences Centre including but not limited to the complete record, file and chart of the Abbey Lane and Mental Health Clinic; e) The complete record and file of Adsum Centre; [4] The Respondent considers these records irrelevant to these proceedings.","The Minister sought numerous orders for production of medical and various other files (including the mother's complete medical files from her family physician, the Nova Scotia Hospital and another hospital, and her files from a woman's shelter and an addiction treatment and prevention service) in an ongoing child protection proceeding.
The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest.
The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means.
In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care.
Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances.
Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings.
However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding.
Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest."
540,"[16] It is our conclusion that the sentence imposed in this case was demonstrably unfit, taking into account the seriousness of the offence and the need to bring this home to the respondent, his lengthy record of previous offences and his assessment as high risk to re-offend, his inability to be controlled in non-custodial setting, and his need for psychological and substance abuse counseling and further education.","This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act.
The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code.
The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition.
HELD: Appeal allowed orally.
The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.
 1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all.
It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted.
The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant.
Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor.
2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation."

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday.
This order was granted at trial.
The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care.
HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period.
JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court.
This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits.
CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months.
During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return.
TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program.
KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR.
1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony.
2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR.
Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent.
During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs.
The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act.
3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time.
KS has quit drinking.
TK is now employed.
KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction.
The parents have a residence.
TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health.
DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time.
TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children.
The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser.
The success of the involvement of DCR in the life of this family would be enhanced with the assignment of another worker."
542,"[7] The evidence that has come into the possession of the appellants after the trial, and that the appellants seek to have admitted, includes: (a) minutes of the council meeting that occurred before the trial; (b) Bylaws 1‑1993, 8‑1994 and 1‑1998 of the rural municipality; and (c) letter, dated more than two years before the trial, from Saskatchewan Government Relations and Aboriginal Affairs to the rural municipality, suggesting an amendment to Bylaw 1‑1993, the rural municipality’s basic planning statement.","The appellants were found guilty of breaching a rural municipal bylaw which provides 'That no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned Hamlet [sic].'
There were four grounds of appeal: 1) an application to admit new evidence on appeal; 2) a constitutional challenge seeking a declaration that the bylaw was ultra vires for uncertainty; 3) the significance of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw; and 4) the meaning of the word 'livestock' in the bylaw.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed.
1) New evidence will not be admitted on an appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial.
Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial.
Neither of these requirements is met.
2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned.
In any event, the uncertainty on which the appellants rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist.
3) The appellants misunderstand the use of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw.
4) Whatever definition of 'livestock' is used, the definition always includes cattle."
543,"(with respect to the timing of the dispute vis vis the decision the Board sought to challenge) The application for declaration...was obviously prepared before January 22nd...prepared in response to January 18th conference call...(when the Board) was refused the adjournment.” At page 182, “The fact that there was real dispute, dispute that apparently is repetitive dispute in terms that it’s not the only time that the Board and the Council have clashed, gives it more credibility and credence and more reason for Court to intervene.” Page 188, quoting from letter attached to one of the imputed affidavits, “The Council has made clear on previous correspondence that the authority to cancel or revoke licenses rests solely with the Council...that is not true voluntary waiver of any claim to dispute jurisdiction.” “It’s clear as matter of common sense, if not on the record itself, that on January 18th when the Board asked for an adjournment and were refused that they reverted to their position.” And page 192, (The affidavits), “were setting out matters of fact and not of opinion.","The defendant council, charged with the general oversight and administration of matters under the Natural Products Marketing Act, delegated certain authority to commodity boards such as the plaintiff.
The plaintiff requested that the defendant hold a show cause hearing to determine whether certain producers had contravened their licence but when a procedural breakdown occurred as to how that hearing would be conducted, with the plaintiff seeking and being denied an adjournment, the hearing was held without the plaintiff's participation.
The plaintiff brought an application for mandamus to compel the defendant to hold a new hearing and filed two affidavits providing some detail and background information as to its reasoning for its failure to attend the hearing and the parties' differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan.
The defendant brought an application to strike certain of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff on the basis that they were an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not forming part of the record.
Application to strike affidavits dismissed;
the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible.
There was no authority for denying the parties the use of affidavits should this application proceed as a jurisdictional dispute and, should it proceed by way of an error of law on the face of the record, the affidavits were also admissible to complete the record."
544,"Otherwise, he remains astute to his affairs and in particular, the court case regarding Margaret Finlayson’s Royal Bank shares which he often discusses.” [13] The Probate Act states, at s.61: 61(1) On the application of any person, the court may remove personal representative where the court is satisfied that removal of the personal representative would be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the court is satisfied that *** (b) the personal representative (I) is neglecting to administer or settle the estate, *** (v) is mentally incompetent ...","The estate applied to have the court find that a large number of bank shares which had been gratuitously transferred by the deceased to her great niece were being held in trust for the deceased.
Following discovery examinations, the great niece, who was the alternative executor appointed under the will, applied to have the executor, the deceased's husband, removed on the basis that his discovery evidence raised grave concerns about his mental capacity to continue to act as executor.
Application to remove the executor dismissed;
there was no medical evidence submitted in support of the applicant's claim that the executor was not competent to administer the estate and although it was clear from the discovery evidence that he did not have a clear understanding of his duties as executor, given that he was the only beneficiary under the will, he was the only person whose interest was at risk if he failed to properly administer the estate."
545,"He makes four points: (a) The Protocol is invalid because it amounts to unilateral amendment of the Payment Schedule; (b) In any event, the Government has no authority to create an individualized payment schedule for particular physician; (c) The AU code was not applicable to Dr. Huerto’s accounts because they did not involve the provision of “unusual” services; and (d) The Protocol was unlawful because it was an attempt to regulate Dr. Huerto’s pattern of practice.","This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients.
Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts.
The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided.
The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information.
He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts.
His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature.
The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success.
HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.
 1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'.
This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians.
The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts.
Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant.
The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule.
The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services.
This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'.
Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service.
This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service.
A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things.
3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act.
It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations.
An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code.
An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded.
These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment.
4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board.
The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts.
It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive."
546,"The entire document reads as follows: Date 20-Oct-2004 Contract between Brian Benson and Ray Dobson This contract is to cover feeding and maintenance of about one hundred and one cows to be boarded at Brian Benson’s farm at Canwood, Sask. [3] As to the bonus to be paid for each live calf brought to Dobson’s pastures, Benson testified that the reason the amount was left blank in the contract was because neither of them were sure what it should be.","The parties entered into a handwritten agreement with regard to the feeding and maintenance of 100 cows.
The plaintiff was to provide labour and the necessary equipment to feed and maintain the cows for $.50 per cow per day.
The defendant was to provide the feed and medicine.
At paragraph 6 the contract stipulated that the plaintiff was to receive a bonus for each live calf that he got to pasture.
The amount of the bonus was left blank.
The plaintiff sues the defendant, claiming a bonus for the 2004-2005 year and the 2005-2006 year.
HELD: The claim is dismissed.
In law an agreement to come to an agreement is not enforceable.
This is especially true where an essential term regarding remuneration has not been agreed to.
The parties agreed that they would settle on the bonus amount later on but they never did.
The plaintiff believes he is still entitled to a bonus.
The Court cannot make the agreement for the parties."
547,The Application to Sever [9] Counsel for the defendants applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of The Queen’s Bench Rules and the Court’s inherent jurisdiction for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiffs’ claim.,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim.
They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent.
Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages.
The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim.
HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction.
Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27.
Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit.
There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action.
The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary.
Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability.
The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated.
Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm.
This joint venture requires confidentiality.
Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence.
Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established.
It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them.
The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim.
The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course.
2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed.
The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics.
The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics.
While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act.
The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract."
548,I will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default.,"FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale.
HELD: Application dismissed.
The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default.
However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months.
There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed.
The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so.
The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs.
On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received.
There will be no costs awarded for this unsuccessful application."
549,"In that case, Berger, J.A. released the young person pending sentence appeal, after finding that strict conditions of release would “in all of the circumstances, best achieve the objects and purposes of the Youth Criminal Justice Act pending the Applicant’s appeal.” [See 8.] In that case, the young person had served all but seven weeks of six-month custodial sentence at the time of the application for release pending appeal.","The young person appealed his sentence on an aggravated assault conviction following a drive-by shooting and applied for release pending appeal.
Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school.
Application for release pending appeal dismissed.
The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard.
Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest."
550,"[38] His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that in my view the situation begged for Detective Constable Thomas to make a clarification such as, ""Brian, you have the right to counsel now before you make any statement to us."" [39] Detective Constable Thomas explained that in dealing with other accused, if he feels there is any lack of understanding of rights, he repeats the caution one line at time and asks after each sentence, ""Do you understand?"" He did not do so in this case.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault, use of a weapon, unlawful possession of a weapon and breach of a recognizance.
The admissibility of the accused's videotaped statement was at issue with regard to his capacity to understand the Charter caution given by the police.
When asked if he wished to contact a lawyer, the accused had responded in the negative, noting that there would 'probably be one down around there anyway.'
statement excluded from evidence; the accused's s. 10(b) rights had been violated.
It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel.
His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that the officer should have made an effort to clarify the informational component of the right to counsel."
551,"Therefore, the Order to Vacate and Demolish dated November 18th, 2004 is hereby confirmed and shall remain in place subject to the following provisions, specifically, the Board has decided in the present circumstances to suspend the enforcement of the Order for period of time to allow the following: a) Larry Markwart will be given the opportunity for period of six (6) months from the date of this decision, to bring forward written proposal to the Board committing to the operation of the building under qualified professional property management firm with proven record and acting at arm’s length to Mr. Markwart.","The appellant appeals a demolition order pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act issued against his property.
Issues on appeal was whether the board erred by considering material which had not been before city council, whether the board committed a jurisdictional error by failing to disclose evidence to the appellant prior to considering the appeal, and whether the board was biased against the appellant.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds.
The board's order is confirmed.
Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order.
The applicant is granted a 6 month period to remedy the problems identified.
1) The board complied with the directions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure had been made to the appellant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board.
The board has ensured that the appellant knew the case he had to meet.
No error of law has been committed.
2) The appellant had all the information considered by the board disclosed to him.
3) There is no evidence of bias.
Oppositely, the evidence supports the board's conclusion that the situation in the building constituted a nuisance related to the activities around the building, including the safety of the residents and surrounding neighbours.
There is no evidence of bias against the appellant personally."
552,"[8] The issue before the court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head’s indebtedness October 19, 2009.","FIAT: This is an application for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act requiring the respondents or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of construction equipment.
The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008.
Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009.
In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head.
In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration.
Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment.
In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number.
The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment.
Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096.
September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head.
The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken.
On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness.
As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment.
Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008.
The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009.
This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland.
HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents.
The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession.
As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act.
When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009.
The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof.
Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent 101138096 free and clear of the claim of the applicant."
553,"M.D. ACTON IN THE PROVINCIAL COURT OF SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2011 SKPC 015 Date: January 17, 2011 Information: 24364651, 24364650 Location: Moose Jaw Between: Her Majesty the Queen and Karyn Mae Fayant Appearing: Mr. Rob Parker For the Crown Mr. Mervin Shaw, Q.C. For the Accused DECISION D.J. KOVATCH, Background [1] The accused, Karyn Mae Fayant is charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window, and with an aggravated assault upon Joe Cwynar. [11] On numerous occasions in the warned statement and in her evidence, Ms. Fayant said she didn’t hit Mr. Cwynar with the candle holder.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief.
The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder.
The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later.
The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument.
The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder.
The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist.
In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember.
The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window.
HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault.
The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder.
The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim.
When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result.
The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date."
554,"He brings this certiorari application to quash a decision of the Academic Appeals Committee of the College of Medicine, and of the University Bylaws Committee of Council.","The applicant was a student at the University of Saskatchewan in the College of Medicine.
He was required to discontinue his studies for failure to meet academic standards for promotion.
The applicant appealed his dismissal and was unsuccessful throughout.
He applied to the Court for an order of certiorari to quash the decision of the Academic Appeals Committee and the University Bylaws Committee Council and an order reinstating him as a student at the College of Medicine pending resolution of his appeal.
HELD: The Court found that the Bylaws Committee Council exceeded its jurisdiction by reviewing the previous decisions made and drawing the conclusion that they were made fairly and properly.
The Bylaw Committee determined the merits of the applicant's appeal and determined that it was not necessary to convene a full appeal board.
There is nothing in the University policy to suggest that the Bylaws Committee has that power.
The Bylaws Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is quashed.
The matter is returned to the Bylaws Committee to determine whether the applicant's appeal falls within the policy on student appeals and academic matters.
The portion of the application requesting reinstatement of the applicant as a student pending the resolution of his appeal is dismissed.
The applicant has a marginal academic record and there are a limited number of placements in the College of Medicine.
It does not make sense to displace another student or require the College of Medicine to train a marginal student on a potentially temporary basis."

MILLS IN THE PROVINCIAL COURT OF SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2012 SKPC 049 Date: March 30, 2012 Information: 24335371 Location: Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan Between: Her Majesty the Queen and Leopold Therrien Appearing: Mr. Rob Parker For the Crown Mr. Jeff Deagle For the Accused DECISION M.T. GORDON, [1] Leopold Therrien is charged as follows: that between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 1991, at Willow Bunch, Saskatchewan, and Regina, Saskatchewan, and Winnipeg, Manitoba, did commit sexual assaults on Leanne Eger contrary to provisions of the Criminal Code. Nicole could not say the frequency of the assault but she cannot recall times with Mr. Therrien when these incidents did not occur.","The accused plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault.
The victims were his granddaughters.
The assaults were alleged to have occurred between 1983 and 1991.
A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts.
The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims.
HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.
The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years.
The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters.
The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim.
Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims."
556,"The appellant says that the trial judge “gave no articulable reason to prefer the confused and contradictory evidence of [the independent witness] over the clear evidence of the Appellant.” The verdict is unreasonable, the appellant argues, since he had no duty to report an accident which he did not know had happened prior to returning from the store.","The appellant appealed his conviction under s. 253(2)(b) of The Traffic Safety Act for failing to provide his name, address, licence and registration at the scene of an accident.
The appellant argued that he was unaware that an accident had occurred and argued that the trial judge's finding that he must have known the accident had occurred was contrary to the evidence.
The appellant also argued that the trial judge erred in preferring the evidence of the Crown's witness over his own.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The trial judge gave sufficient reasons for her decision and took all of the relevant evidence into consideration.
She was entitled to assess the credibility of the independent witness and to prefer it over the evidence of the appellant."
557,[5] In the present motions FCC seeks orders pursuant to Rule 173(a) and (e) and the court’s inherent jurisdiction to strike the entire statements of defence on the following grounds:    (a) the statements of defence filed by the defendant fail to disclose reasonable defences to the plaintiff’s foreclosure proceedings;  (b) the claims asserted on statements of defence should be advanced in separate actions; and  (c) the statements of defence are otherwise an abuse of the process of this Honourable Court.,"FIAT: The plaintiff sought orders pursuant to Rule 173(a) and (e)of the Queen's Bench Rules and the Court's inherent jurisdiction to strike the entire statements of defence as they failed to disclose reasonable defences; the claims asserted on statements of defence should be advanced in separate actions; and the statements of defence were abuse of the Court's process.
HELD: The applications were dismissed with each defendant to recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff.
Although the defendants' pleading may delay but not defeat or prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with its foreclosure action, the defences were so closely connected with the plaintiff's demands that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking the defendant's defences into consideration."
558,[21] The Director submits that Mr. Newell’s application respecting abuse of process in the court below had the effect of preventing SCAN order and that it should not have been made and there is therefore no jurisdiction to hear his appeal from such an application.,"HELD: The Court addressed the issue of jurisdiction by holding that it would follow its usual practice to refuse to hear an entirely new matter argued for the first time on appeal.
Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act.
The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested.
The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act.
However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances."
559,"[2] In her reasons for judgment, the trial judge addressed whether it would be in the best interests of the child to grant custody to the father or to the mother in accordance with the factors set out in s.","The respondent mother applied to lift the stay of execution imposed by Court of Appeal Rule 15(1) when the appellant father appealed the trial judge's decision to award custody of the parties' son to the mother with the child to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the school year (see: 2013 SKQB 212).
The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent.
As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother.
HELD: The Court granted the application.
There would be no harm to the child if the stay was lifted.
The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted."
560,"While they were engaged in sexual intercourse, the accused’s daughter, M.R., burst into the room, admonished them for having sex, and demanded that the complainant leave. [17] As the complainant has no memory of the sexual activity, the only evidence before me as to what occurred between the complainant and the accused in the bedroom leading up to and during the sexual activity is the evidence of the accused, which included the following: The complainant asked him if there was place where they could “be together”; They agreed to go to his sister’s house to see if she would give them room; They both walked into the room, and took off their own clothes; They engaged in mutual foreplay which progressed to sexual intercourse.","There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility.
The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment.
The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent.
The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister.
Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication.
It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent.
The accused was found not guilty."
561,"(P.L.), 1991 CanLII 103 (SCC), [1991] S.C.R. 909, [1991] S.C.J. No. 37 (QL)) [38] Applying this standard to the facts in this case, it is clear for essentially the same reasons as those provided in relation to the alleged misapprehension of evidence that the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the learned trial judge’s conclusion that the appellant’s evidence as to the amount he consumed was untrue.","The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed.
The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle.
The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c);
the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice;
2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed;
3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard.
The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence.
The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;
 4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively.
The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results.
The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error.
The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law;
5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue.
The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice;
and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness.
The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial.
Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases.
Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong.
The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings."
562,CONCLUSION SENTENCE [123] Calvin Klemenz and Thomas Matychuk both have been found guilty by jury of breaking and entering the home of F.J. and committing therein the indictable offence of aggravated sexual assault. [145] The sentence I am imposing with respect to Thomas Matychuk is 12 years of imprisonment for breaking and entering F.J.’s house and committing therein the offence of aggravated sexual assault.,"Criminal Law – Home Invasion – Sentencing
HELD: The Court sentenced Klemenz to 12 years imprisonment for breaking and entering and committing the offence of aggravated sexual assault.
He was given credit for 22 months spent in custody.
Matychuk was sentenced to 12 years in prison but was given credit for time in custody on a 1:1 basis because the Court had not found any circumstances to justify any greater amount of credit.
Matychuk’s credit was for 19 months.
The sentences were based on the circumstances of the offence: a home invasion and inflicting serious bodily harm on a young victim.
The assault was violent and degrading and took place over a period of time.
Weapons were used while the victim was bound and sexually assaulted and threatened."
563,"Considering these cases Madam Justice Jackson says in Rogers at paragraph 28 as follows: agree with Crown counsel’s submissions, as stated in the above paragraph, but Crown counsel goes on to extract from the above cases the principle that the police have an implied power to knock on someone’s door for the purpose of investigating possible drinking and driving offence, even if they do so with the intention of gathering evidence about the state of an occupant’s sobriety.","HELD: The Charter application was granted.
The accused was found not guilty.
The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights had been breached.
After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view.
The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence.
Regarding the impaired driving charge, the accused was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence."
564,"June 21, 2016 Introduction [1] The wife applies for interim spousal support and an order providing her with an interim distribution of property in the amount of $25,000. [8] In Antonishyn Boucher, 2011 SKQB 147 (CanLII), 373 Sask 154, he expanded on his comments in Hein and provided comprehensive overview of the principles to be considered on an interim application for spousal support as follows: 38 Case law has established that at an interim stage, what may be “reasonable” may differ from what may be “reasonable” at the final or variation stage.","HELD: The application for interim spousal support was granted and the respondent ordered to pay $500 per month.
The order was made to diminish the disparity between the income and lifestyles of the parties.
The application for interim distribution of property was dismissed.
The court found that this was not a situation where the net assets exceeded the amount of the distribution claimed.
As the respondent had no liquid assets, the distribution of family property might eventually involve a spousal rollover from the pension funds to the petitioner."
565,"The reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered orally by: MATTHEWS, J.A.: The appellant, after guilty pleas on April 17, 1990, was sentenced by Judge R.","22 year old male pled guilty to seven counts of break, enter and theft

Allowing the appeal, setting aside the chambers decision and giving judgment to the appellant.
While the prothonotary did not have jurisdiction to extend the time for the application, an additional chambers order had resolved the timeliness issue in the appellant's favour."
567,"While noting that the plaintiffs woodland/lumber mill business was ""substantially altered"" by his motor vehicle accident, .., an analysis of Mr. Corkum's operating results for the period before and after the accident, and examination of relevant information on the forest‑products industry in general, suggests clearly that number of influences were already well under way at the time of the accident, whose impact would have negatively influenced both 1989 and subsequent‑years operations of Mr. Corkum."" (Gervason report, Exhibit No. 2, Tab 5, p. Prior to his accident, it would appear that Mr. Corkum's farm and forestry operation generated the necessary income to maintain ownership of these assets."" There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the plaintiff ever received anything approaching an 8‑10% rate of return.","The 53-year-old plaintiff suffered a neck injury (cervical dystonia) in a car accident.
After undergoing treatment from 14 specialists, the plaintiff had little relief four years following the accident.
He was rendered permanently disabled from all work for which he was trained and could no longer work the farm, sawmill or Christmas tree operation he had developed.
Assessing non-pecuniary damages at $60,000.
In assessing pecuniary damages, the court accepted the defendant's expert evidence which led to the conclusion the plaintiffs businesses were marginally profitable.
The defendants were ordered to pay $30,000 as real, net loss of future income.
The court approved a 5% capitalization rate as being appropriate where there was an eight year term to age 65.
The plaintiff settled his future Section B benefits just before trial.
The court rejected the defence argument that they were entitled to a credit for present value of those benefits which represented a figure over seven times the settlement figure.
The defendants were only entitled to a credit for sums actually paid to the plaintiff.
The court rejected the plaintiff's actuarial report as being late and in breach of Civil Procedure Rule 31.08."
568,"The assets are matrimonial property owned by the husband, at the date of application, and subject, unless it would be unfair and inequitable, to equal sharing.","Appeal from 107 SaskR 135, 44 RFL(3d)185.
Appeal from a judgment directing matrimonial property.
The main issue was whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated.
The couple's marriage had lasted less than four years.
HELD: The QB judgment was upheld regarding the severance package.
The severance package was not a reward for past service; it was for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination.
The severance package was based on future earnings, which would have occurred within the duration of the marriage.
The QB judge did however fail to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give the husband his one-half share of them.
Judgment varied accordingly."
569,"This application is made on the following grounds: 1.That the amount of the liquidated debtor demand in the affidavit for garnishee summons is inconsistent with the previous position of the Defendant (Plaintiff by Counterclaim); 2.That the affidavit for garnishee summons does not strictly comply with Section 3(2) of The Attachment of Debts Act. Section 3(2) reads: (2) The summons shall be issued by the local registrar upon the plaintiff or judgment creditor, his solicitor or agent, filing an affidavit; (a) showing the nature and amount of the claim against the defendant or the amount remaining due and unsatisfied under the judgment, and swearing positively to the indebtedness of the defendant or judgment debtor to the plaintiff or judgment creditor; (b) stating, that, to the best of the deponent's information and belief, the proposed garnishee, naming him, is indebted to the defendant or judgment debtor, or, if the moneys sought to be attached are wages or salary, that, to the best of the deponent's information and belief, the defendant or judgment debtor was or is employed by the garnishee and where and in what capacity the defendant or judgment debtor was or is so employed.","1)Application by plaintiffs (defendants by counterclaim) for an order setting aside the default judgment, writ of execution and 2)garnishee summonses issued against them.
3)Application by respondents (plaintiffs by counterclaim) for payment out of the monies garnisheed.
HELD: 1)Application allowed.
At the time that the applicants were served with the statement of defence and counterclaim, they were not represented by counsel nor did they know that they had to serve and file a statement of defence to the counterclaim.
However, immediately upon being served with the garnishee summons they contacted solicitors.
The application to set aside the default judgment was made as soon as possible after the judgment came to the attention of the applicants who have explained to the satisfaction of the court their failure to defend the counterclaim.
The applicants have clearly shown that they have a good defence on the merits to the counterclaim.
The applicants did not delay their application to set aside the judgment so that it cannot be argued that delay will cause irreparable injury to the respondents.
2)Application to set aside guarishee summons dismissed.
There has been strict compliance with s.3(2) of the Act.
The affidavits filed by the applicants challenging the affidavit for garnishee summons have no bearing on whether the garnishee summons should be set aside.
It is not the function of a judge to look into the merits of the case on such an application.
3)Application for payment out of monies garnisheed dismissed.
Section 14(1) of The Attachment of Debts Act provides that no order shall be made for payment out of any money paid into court by the garnishee when a garnishee summons issues prior to judgment until the plaintiff has recovered a judgment against the defendant.
Since the judgment has been set aside the application for payment out is premature and is therefore dismissed without prejudice to reapply."

The Rentalsman granted a writ of possession and after the issuance of the writ, amended the writ to correct the address without notice to the tenant.
The tenant appealed.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
There had not been compliance with s. 23(1)(b) of the Act.
The notice to vacate was therefore ineffective and the consequent writ of possession was quashed.
Given the tenant's obstructionist tactics he was denied his costs of the appeal."

At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident.
The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings.

Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done.
The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court.
2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert.
3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance.
4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected.

The appellant complained the judge did not provide adequate reasons for the decision.
Dismissing the appeal,
that the decision was supported by the evidence.
The court referred to R. v. Burns, [1994]

2)All assets were valued as the same time, the time of the application.
The midpoint of the valuations was used to value the respondent's interest in the company at $192,727.00.

4)Any interest accrued on the sale of the matrimonial home was to be divided equally.
5)The petitioner received her automobile, RRSP and bank account.
6)She was given judgment against the respondent for $135,982.00 with a charge against the matrimonial assets to be registered at Land Titles.
7)$84,000 of the respondent's RRSP was transferred by way of spousal roll over to the petitioner.
8)$12,000 of the settlement proceeds from the wrongful dismissal claim were to be assigned and paid out to the petitioner.
9)All monies were to be paid within six months failing which the Sheriff was to proceed with the judicial sale of such of the assets of the respondent as may be required.
10)Judgment and a charge was ordered against the respondent for the outstanding property taxes in the amount of $15,428.64 which he was to have paid on or before October 1, 1993 by a previous court order.

The defendant dismissed the plaintiff for 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'.
The plaintiff had taken longer coffee and lunch breaks than were allowed, and had taken unauthorized breaks for which he had then been paid overtime by the defendant.
For the defendant,
that the dismissal was justified.
The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules."

The proposal had received the necessary proportion of support from Gustafson's creditors.
One unsecured creditor opposed the application.
HELD: 1)Under s. 59(2), before it can approve a proposal, the Court must be satisfied; (a) that the terms are reasonable; (b) that the terms are calculated to benefit the general body of creditors; and (c) that the proposal is made in good faith. 2)In determining whether to approve a proposal, the court must consider not only the wishes and interests of creditors, but also the conduct and interests of the debtor, the interests of the public and future creditors and the requirements of commercial morality. 3)If, however, a large majority of creditors, i.e., substantially in excess of the statutory majority, have voted for acceptance of a proposal, it will take strong reasons for the court to substitute its judgment for that of the creditors.
4)Gustafson had met the criteria set out in the Act and the authorities referred to in Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law of Canada, and accordingly the proposal was approved."
586,In the absence of oral agreement the question may be asked on what basis such statement of intention on the part of the applicant to the respondent grievor was even admissible before the Board.,"FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee.
The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer.
The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction.
The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination.
The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'.
The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay.
HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable.
If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness.
3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise.
The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness.
4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule.
The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct.
5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing."
587,"February 6, 1995 The applicants (accused) apply for the following relief: (1)A Declaration that sections 300 and 301 of the Criminal Code, constitute an unreasonable limitation of one or more of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by sections 2, and 11(c)and (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and by reason thereof are of no force or effect; (2)A Declaration that sections 300 and 301 of the Criminal Code fail to describe an offence known in law and by reason thereof are of no force or effect. find that there is rational connection between the objectives of protecting the privacy and reputations of persons in the defamatory libel provisions of the Criminal Code and the limitation on freedom of expression as guaranteed under s.","The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer.
They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code.
The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial.
At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter.
The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter.
HELD: Application allowed in part.
 1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society.
While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective.
S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused.
They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence.
The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true.
S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid.
ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner."
588,"The grounds for appeal are as follows:  (a)That the conviction was contrary to the law, the evidence and weight of the evidence;  (b)That the learned trial judge made an error in law in determining the degree of impairment by alcohol or drug required before a conviction can be entered; (c)Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may allow. The Ontario Court of Appeal decides that, and quote: ""impairment is an issue of fact which the trial judge must decide on the evidence and the standard of proof is neither more nor less than that required for any other element of criminal offence: courts should not apply tests which imply tolerance that does not exist in law."" Further, the Stellato decision states as follows: ""In all criminal cases the trial judge must be satisfied as to the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt before conviction can be registered.","The accused appealed her conviction on a charge of impaired driving.
The grounds of her appeal were that the trial judge erred in determining that she was impaired, and that the trial judge otherwise misconstrued and misapplied the evidence.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
 1)Both grounds of appeal raised questions of fact.
Findings of fact are not to be reversed on appeal unless it can be established that the trial judge has made some palpable and overriding error which affected her assessment of the facts. 2)The Court's task is not to retry the case or substitute its own decision.
A trial judge's findings of fact can only be overturned if they are so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable.
3)The Court was unable to say that an error of that kind was made by the trial judge in this case."
589,"In preparing his opinions Dr. Elson reviewed: medical summary prepared by the Saskatchewan Department of Health for the purpose of getting an overview of the extent of the medical treatments received by Ms. Smid but not as to any particular injury or management; the medical reports reviewed by Mr. Shiels; the examinations for discovery of Ms. Smid and Mr. Rooke for the purpose of getting background information rather than specific data for the purposes of his opinion; the outpatient report from Royal University Hospital dated March 4, 1993 regarding its treatment of Ms. Smid; the McConnell report, West report and Szabo report including videotapes and measurement taken in connection with the McConnell report; SGI accident reports covering the collision; and report prepared by Mr. Shiels and delivered to Dr. Elson few days prior to the trial.","The Plaintiff commenced these proceedings seeking to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been suffered in a motor vehicle accident.

HELD: The question posed was answered in the affirmative.
While a normal healthy person might not have been injured in this low speed rear-end collision, the Court was satisfied that, because of the Plaintiff's previous injuries and poor sitting position, the collision did contribute to her current condition in a modest manner."

591,"Foundation Co. of Canada (1992), C.C.L.I.(2d) (B.C.S.C.), the British Columbia Supreme Court was forced to consider whether an insurer was obliged to defend its insured when it was unclear whether policy would provide coverage for claims advanced against the insured.","Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg.
Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage.
Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident.
Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles.
It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate.
HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy.
Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend.
Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify.
When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in.
The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'.
To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy.
The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision.
He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit.
CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.
 1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.
To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to.
There were inconsistencies in terminology.
The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored."
592,"The applicable statutory reference is subsection 5(1) of The Attachment of Debts Act which provides: 5(1) Service of the summons on the garnishee shall bind any debt due or accruing due from the garnishee to the defendant or judgment debtor and all wages or salary that become due or payable at any time within five days after service of the summons. The main point before this Court was consideration of Firstline's claim that the debt under the GIC was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served, i.e., that service of the garnishee summons did not “bind” the debt within the meaning of s.","The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.
The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David.
First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity.
When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate.
Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application.
The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.
 1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable.
3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.
 4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable.
The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due.
Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas.
The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment.
Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due.
5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose.
It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances.
DISSENT:
The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date.
The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation.
There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable."
593,"[5] The accused refers to the new sections in the Criminal Code with respect to alternative measures of sentencing and requests that he be given a non-custodial sentence.

There were numerous adverse impacts on the victim.
2)Mitigating circumstances included the absence of a criminal record; his abstinence from alcohol since the assault; the absence of penile penetration; his remorse and apology to the victim and to the court; his serious health problems; his ability to rehabilitate and the fact that he was a model citizen prior to the assault."

He continues by observing there is no such mandate on an employer in providing notice, or compensation in lieu thereof, to dismissed employee.","The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years.
As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation.

The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages.
Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months.
Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified.
Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable.
Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears.
Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had."

HELD: The child was placed in the custody of the Minister until the age of 18 years.
It was strongly recommended that she remain in the foster parents' home where she had been for three years.
The natural parents were to have reasonable access.
1)The child was in need of protection.
The parents were unable to provide for all her needs even with the considerable assistance from the Department.
She was exposed to severe domestic disharmony which could have resulted in emotional harm.
The natural parents' ability to provide for her needs had not improved significantly.
The child's special needs resulting from attention deficit disorder required enormous amounts of care and attention on a daily basis.
2)It was in the child's best interests to remain where she was and to continue to have contact with her natural parents."
598,"CONCLUSION For the reasons stated above, and my findings that the applicants have not met the first and second tests, and taking into account the factors to be considered in the third test, I hold and order:  (a)that the plaintiffs' application under paragraph 2 of its notice of motion must be, and is hereby dismissed;  (b)that the escrow agent, being the firm of McLellan, Cundall, Bridges and Baumgartner, as set forth in the Plan shall forthwith;  (i)in accordance with paragraph 3.6(c) of the Plan, remit to Herc the lien property revenues which the escrow agent has received, and interest earned thereon;   (ii)remit to Herc the lien property revenues (including interest earned thereon), if any, paid to the escrow agent by Herc,  after deduction of the escrow agent's appropriate costs in acting as such escrow agent.","FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties.
The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties.
The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs.
With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division.
The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens.
The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported.
Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened.
3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue.
The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted.
The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production.
If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys.
A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing.
The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act.
The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times.
On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a).
5)The second and third tests were not met.
The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value.
It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do.
If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent.
There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan.
The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued."
599,"Gordon turned down the offer of Administrative Assistant and Secretary because not only was the salary much lower, the position was temporary and the duties were materially different from those at her job with Gabriel Dumont Institute.

The position of executive secretary was discontinued for economic reasons.
HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $30,737.93 plus costs plus pre-judgment interest.
1)The plaintiff had taken all reasonable steps to mitigate her losses.
The duty is to take such steps as a reasonable person would take in his own interests to maintain his income and position in his industry, trade or profession.
The former employer has no right to expect that the former employee will accept a lower paying alternative employment with doubtful prospects.
2)Reasonable notice would have been ten months.
She had been erroneously requested to take 19.871 days as annual leave and therefore actually received one months' notice.

Pension Plan Cara Brown provided the court with four valuation options in two categories for the purpose of determining Mary's share of John's pension (See Tabs 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34 of Exhibit P-1).","At issue was the determination of the quantum of spousal and child support and division of matrimonial property.
HELD: 1)The respondent's supplementary allowances were taken into consideration in finding a gross salary of $53,000.00 per annum.
Due to an injury he was no longer able to work overtime but was working full-time.
Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage.
The frequent moves due to the husband's employment had disrupted the petitioner's employment and university education.
However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse.
3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage.
Shares in joint names were divided equally.
Other assets were divided equally.
4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits.
The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date.
The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner.
5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income.
$600.00 per month per child was awarded.
 6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse.
The petitioner's future plans were realistic.
$800 per month until June 1, 2001 was awarded for spousal support.
 7)Costs including one-half of the cost of preparing reports and pension valuations were awarded to the petitioner."
601,"Election to Reinstate In the instant case, the plaintiff argues that the insurer has elected to repair the damaged motor vehicle pursuant to statutory condition 8(4) of s.","A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident.
The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued.
An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found.
A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation.
The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.
SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act.
SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview.
It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event.
HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.
 1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs.
Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate.
An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate.
The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke.
On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate.
The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction.
Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate.
Estoppel was not applicable.
Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act.
The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages.
These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1).
They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4).
Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle.
As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).
 3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear.
A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.
 4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act."

The defendants asserted their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was different than those previously dealt with.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause.
1)The fact that the plaintiffs filed a 55 page brief in support of their submissions and the defendants filed a 14 page brief in response evidenced that the issues were not easily resolved and certainly not on a summary basis.
 2)An application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justifiable dispute is revealed.
If no facts are in dispute, the parties may resort to Rule 188.
Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve the questions of law."
603,Calcutt says Farr agreed to the 15ï¿½ offer and he thinks he would have told Farr that Johnson Seeds would pick up the canary seed on the back side of the contract the same time it took the call on the contract canary seed.,"The plaintiff, a specialty seed marketing company, claimed damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract.
Johnson Seeds entered contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting to secure product for resale.
After extended negotiations the defendant eventually signed and mailed the standard form contract but never received an executed copy.
The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993.
The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price.
HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action.
1)There was a valid contract between the parties.
Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract.
2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract.
The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone.
There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist.
Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94.
The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions.
Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.
 4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem.
Johnson Seeds waited until the last possible day under the written contract terms to call the contract in an effort to position itself to claim increased damages for breach of contract."
604,"any proper questions arising therefrom, and proper questions arising from further and better production of documents by Coopers Lybrand (as may be ordered) and any proper questions seeking Mr. Krake's opinions on audit issues arising in the context of Saskatchewan Trust Company records or files, whether or not such records or files were examined by Coopers Lybrand when it performed its audits of Saskatchewan Trust Company"". In the result, grant an order essentially in the terms offered by the plaintiff, as follows: Upon the continuation of the examination for discovery of Clarence Roy Krake, he shall answer the particular questions that he heretofore has refused to answer, any proper questions arising therefrom, any proper questions arising from further and better production of documents by Coopers & Lybrand as hereinafter ordered and any proper questions seeking Mr. Krake's opinions on audit issues arising in the context of Saskatchewan Trust Company records or files, whether or not such records or files were examined by Coopers & Lybrand when it performed its audits of Saskatchewan Trust Company.","HELD: 1)The officer was to answer any proper questions seeking his opinion on audit issues arising in the context of the Trust Company's records or files.
To be proper the questions need only be broadly relevant to the issues raised in the pleadings in the sense that they are in some way connected to the allegations made.
Hypothetical questions seeking his opinion consequent upon his professional experience could be asked where his and C&amp;L's conduct were in issue.
The officer's expert opinion could not be sought on matters not raised in the pleadings.
2)The disclosure and production of documents was justified under the broad relevance test.
A party is entitled to discovery of a document if it directly or indirectly enables him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary or may fairly lead to a form of inquiry which may have either consequence. 3)The 'damage claim documents' had been provided.
There should be a sameness in the manner and isolation of the documents in the discovery process undertaken by each party.
Whether the memoranda of discussions with third parties were privileged or irrelevant was a matter for the trial judge.
4)The issue of compelling a response to undertakings had been resolved.
5)The request for an order for an immediate pre-trial conference was redundant as there was no basis for one until the action was ready for trial.
6)Leave to further amend the statement of claim pursuant to Rule 165 had been granted."
605,"The main argument for the plaintiff, in urging the Court to so conclude, are firstly, that Dr. Urbanski made no mention of having performed in the narrative portion of his report of operation (Exhibit P-1 D-1 VUH Doc. 21) and secondly, that given that retained products of conception were the likely cause of the post-partum hemorrhage, if had been performed it would likely have fully remedied the problem on September 29, 1997.","A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis.
She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy.
HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs.
1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her.
The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics.
2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part.
The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix.
Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted.
The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage.
ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4:
The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes."
606,"Section 16(2) provides that the youth court shall take into account the following factors in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public: (a) the seriousness of the alleged offence and the circumstances in which it was allegedly committed; (b) the age, maturity, character and background of the young person and any record or summary of previous findings of delinquency under the Juvenile Delinquents Act, chapter J-3 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970, or previous findings of guilt under this Act or any other Act or Parliament or any regulation made thereunder; (c) the adequacy of this Act, and the adequacy of the Criminal Code or any other Act of Parliament that would apply in respect of the young person if an order were made under this section to meet the circumstances of the case; (d) the availability of treatment or correctional resources; (e) any representations made to the court by or on behalf of the young person or by the Attorney General or his agent; and (f) any other factors that the court considers relevant.","The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult.
The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue.
The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency.
The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult.
The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989.
The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court.
The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision.
It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult.
HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court.
Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.
 1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges.
If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth.
The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.
 2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application.
R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts."
607,"The plaintiff said that as she approached the area in front of the canteen doors, she tripped on something and stumbled over the sidewalk and onto the platform and then through the open door and landed on the floor inside the canteen. FINDINGS OF FACT find based on the evidence before me that the plaintiff tripped on the door threshold at the entrance to the canteen building.","The plaintiff fell while entering a canteen operated by the defendant.
She claimed to have tripped on the concrete sidewalk located in front of the canteen.
Others testified that she tripped on the door threshold of the building.
Dismissing the claim,
that the plaintiff's evidence of where she tripped is unreliable.
Furthermore, there was no unusual danger on the premises."
608,"Cole PLACE HEARD: Amherst, Nova Scotia DATE HEARD: 06 May 1998 CHARGE: THAT THEY, on or about the 3' day of September, 1997, at, or near 147 South Albion Street, Amherst, in the County of Cumberland, Province of Nova Scotia, did sell tobacco or tobacco product to person under the age of 19 years, contrary to section 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act. COUNSEL: Mr. Bruce Baxter, for the Crown Mr. William Ryan, for the Defense C.A. No.148131 NOVA SCOTIA COURT OF APPEAL BETWEEN: HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN, as represented by the Attorney General of Nova Scotia and SOBEY'S INCORPORATED, body Respondent REASONS FOR JUDGEMENT BY: CROMWELL, J.A.","The respondent grocery store was charged with selling tobacco to a person under the age of 19, contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act.
The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial.
The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province.
He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails.
The trial judge further commented that, had the Act been constitutional, he would have convicted because he did not accept the accused's defence of due diligence.
The Crown appealed, and the accused cross-appealed.
Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial,
that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction.
It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act.
The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires.
The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence.
The question is not, as the trial judge thought, whether the employee who sold the tobacco was duly diligent, but whether the accused, her employer, exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent the commission of the offence, and by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system."
609,"Clearly, Woods and Shatilla were in the occupation of trenching and pipe-laying in the service of the defendant Pederson [15] Woods and Shatilla had no expectation of receiving anything but wages for hours worked at St.George’s Hill; they certainly had no prospect of making profit on the job wages not profits were in the contemplation of all involved.","The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations.
It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability.
The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances.
The essential facts were not in dispute.
HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.
 1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met.
This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site.
Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available.
Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced.
The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching.
No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision.
The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups.
2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible.
There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor.
The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship.
The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages."
610,"The order made by Mr. Justice F.W. Dickson of this Court on the 16 day of July, 1993 which provided for payment of maintenance as follows: That the Respondent MICHAEL GERARD DANSEREAU, shall pay to the Petitioner as and for maintenance for the children the sum of $250 per month per child to commence July 15, 1993 and continuing on the fifteenth day of each month thereafter.","In the first application under the Family Maintenance Act the father sought to reduce child maintenance of $250 per child per month to an amount in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines; cancellation of arrears of $13,273.39; and increased access.
In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck.
HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.
 2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears.
Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997.
The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997.
Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times.
Upon payment of $5,000 the balance of arrears accrued prior to December 31/98 would be extinguished.
3)The father was to pay child support of $325 per month for the two children.
Garnishment of his wages by the Maintenance Enforcement Office were to be limited to $175 per month for arrears plus the current maintenance due.
4)The parties agreed the father should have access not less than one full weekend per month upon two weeks prior notice plus when he was available to attend at the city in a manner consistent with the children's best interests and their need to be available for school."
611,"[28] There will be an order as follows:  (a) The petitioner shall parent Travis and Jonathan, who shall reside with the petitioner, except during those times when the respondent shall parent the children;  (b) The respondent shall parent the children as follows:  (i) Two weekends out of every three weekends commencing Friday after work to Sunday evening.","The primary issue was the appropriate parenting arrangement for the two children.
The 1997 interim order awarded joint custody with the primary residence with the mother and reasonable access to the father including alternating weekends, reasonable telephone access and equal sharing of holidays.
The father initially failed to pay child support as ordered then paid $250 per month rather than the $424.72 ordered.
The parties no longer communicated directly with each other except by e-mail so that there was a record.
HELD: 1)It was in the best interests of the children that their primary residence be with their mother.
She had demonstrated greater flexibility and sensitivity to their needs.
The father was granted access two weekends out of every three and additional time as they may agree upon.
Although both were very good parents the parties had not demonstrated an ability to co-parent effectively as illustrated by their communication problems.
The father's access initially went beyond the minimum required by the interim order.
He failed to make support payments as ordered.
The father was to pay child support of $449.
Pursuant to s.7 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines he was to pay 54% of the net cost of child care expenses incurred as a result of the mother's employment and for health related expenses in excess of $100 of the insurance reimbursement upon production of receipts.
 2)The automobile constituted matrimonial property and was valued at $200. 3)Either could speak to costs."
612,"[6] The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs should be awarded primarily because of the offer of settlement made to the respondent on September 16, 1996 for lump sum payment of $250,000, inclusive of costs, and provided that, if the offer was not accepted by September 27, 1996, claim would be commenced under The Dependants’ Relief Act, 1996, supra to seek the entirety of the estate.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs.
At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs.
The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs.
Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties.
Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial.
The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000.
The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial.
The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate.
The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers.
HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case.
The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure.
The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance.
In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate.
Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances.
The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous.
The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs.
The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements."
613,"4. In the judgment, Finlayson, J.A., noted also that in Provincial Court it will be for the trial judge to decide what procedure should be followed, but at least, counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, counsel for the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application for exclusion is made.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application.
This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition.
In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process.
This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter.
In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue.
The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire.
The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure.
If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues.
The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy.
An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application.
This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine.
It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues.
The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate."
614,"150) [6] Having reached that conclusion, the learned trial judge quite properly dealt with the next question, namely–had the Crown on the evidence before him established by credible evidence beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant (notwithstanding that he had rebutted the presumption) was nevertheless in de facto control of the vehicle to the point that he performed some acts which involved the use of it or its fittings or some other cause of conduct which might put the vehicle in motion so that it could become dangerous to other users of the roadway where it was parked? Yes. Well, he’s not too sure, but he says he might [sic] done this, but then we have the evidence of the police officer, Constable Faber, who testified that he found the key in the ignition at the “on” position, not in the accessories position of the vehicle, but on the “on” position.","An appeal of a conviction for having the care or control of a motor vehicle after consuming in excess of 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code.
Although the trial judge concluded the appellant rebutted the presumption in s.258(1)(where it is proven that an accused occupies the seat normally occupied by the operator of the vehicle, it is presumed he is in care and control unless he can establish that he did not occupy the seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion), the appellant was found to be in de facto control.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
It was clear from the trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the two paramedics who had noted the car parked in an unusual place and police officer who came along later, that he rejected the theory advanced by the appellant's counsel.
The location of the ignition key was not relevant.
The appellant's memory of the events was far from clear given the level of his intoxication.
The trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on the evidence of the Crown witnesses."
615,"[1] Allbright, J.: The applicants, the paternal grandparents, seek an order granting them access to their grandson, R.D.G., born December [...], 1995, pursuant to s. I believe that one Saturday access period every two months would be appropriate under all of the circumstances and accordingly it is hereby ordered that W.B. and J.B. shall be granted access to their grandson, R.D.G., one Saturday every second month from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. The respondent, A.G., shall fix each access period two months in advance.","HELD: The grandparents were granted access one Saturday every second month from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.
It would be in the best interests of the child to have some ongoing relationship with both his maternal and paternal grandparents.
The father lived in Alberta and may not be able to exercise the degree of access he was seeking.
The relationships were separate with unique characteristics."
616,"[24] The plaintiff says that in the approximate one year from the opening of the store until the day of the accident, he had never observed “dolly” located where it was at the time he tripped.","Plaintiff suffered soft tissue damage to knee when he tripped over a dolly cart in a building supply warehouse.
Knee became swollen and infected and he was off work for 12 days.
He claimed for pain and suffering, loss of income and loss of earning capacity.
Plaintiff was found 60% responsible for injuries and defendant 40% responsible.
Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks.
The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury.
However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door.
He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously.
The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path.
The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial.
There was no evidence to support a claim for diminishment of earning capacity."
617,"[7] The relevant portions of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act read as follows: 146(1) Subject to subsections (3) to (5), surviving spouse is entitled to death benefit calculated in accordance with the following formula: DB (50% IRB) where: DB is the death benefit payable; and IRB is the weekly income replacement benefit that the deceased victim would have been entitled to arising out of the accident if the victim had survived the accident.","SGI paid $47,427, the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, to the guardian of the three infant children of the deceased single mother.
The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits.
She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident.
Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854.
The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs.
Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5).
It is the total amount payable as a death benefit.
The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero.
Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5)."
618,"In fact, notwithstanding the Crown’s September 29 advice to the court and to the defence that there was further material to disclose on the fraud charges, no additional disclosure was made in the four-month period between the originally scheduled preliminary hearing date of September 29, 1998 and the adjourned date of February 8, 1999.","The accused, Cote, applied for remedy pursuant to s.24 of the Charter of Rights stating that he was denied the right to be tried on a fraud charge within a reasonable time.
Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date.
Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial.
The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure.
HELD: The charge was stayed.
In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry.
This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay.
Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time.
Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay.
He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship.
The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay.
Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon."
619,"The Defendant, Michael Power, further states that at the request of the Plaintiff and upon confirmation of instructions from the parties through Eugene Greba, he agreed that any money provided by the parties to him for payment of the account of the Plaintiff or any monies received on behalf of the parties as result of the successful conclusion of the litigation as between the parties and SCIC would be paid to the Plaintiff by the Defendant as solicitor for the parties.","FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty.
In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees.
The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum.
The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC.
When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies.
The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33.
The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit.
HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.
 1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure.
2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.
 3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence.
It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits.
4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions.
A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings.
The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear.
The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt.
His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account."
620,"IN THE QUEEN’S BENCH JUDICIAL CENTRE OF SASKATOON IN THE MATTER OF JUDICIAL REVIEW PURSUANT TO PART 52 OF THE QUEEN’S BENCH RULES AND THE INHERENT SUPERVISORY JURISDICTION OF THE COURT AND IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION TO SET ASIDE THE OCTOBER 6, 1999 DECISION OF THE SASKATCHEWAN LIQUOR AND GAMING LICENSING COMMISSION (SLGLC) RE: DISQUALIFICATION OF THE HORSE “CHEETARA” 6TH RACE, SUNDAY, AUGUST 5, 1999—MARQUIS DOWNS, SASKATOON BETWEEN: BEVERLY BROOKS, BARCLAY BROOKS and STERLING McWATTERS and THE SASKATCHEWAN LIQUOR AND GAMING LICENSING COMMISSION (SLGLC), THE SASKATCHEWAN LIQUOR AND GAMING AUTHORITY, CHERYL TWIGG, JIM TWIGG, RIVER RIDGE FARMS and MERV WILSON RESPONDENTS Gwen V. Section 17(4) sets out the information which the Commission can consider in hearing an application for review of the stewards’ decision: 17(4) On review conducted pursuant to this section, the commission may consider: (a) any information submitted by the applicant; (b) any information considered by the authority in making its decision; and (c) where an oral hearing is held, any information given or representations made at the oral hearing.","An application for a judicial review of a decision by the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Commission which held that the veering to the left by the two horses was within the tolerance of interference at the gate for two year olds.
The Commission overturned the decision of the stewards and restored the horse declared to be in first place.
In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants.
The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard.
HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed.
The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants.
1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.
 2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record.
The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.
 3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence.
The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual.
5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions.
The decision of the Commission to refuse to give the applicants notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable.
Their rights were affected by the decision.
Bibeault was distinguishable. 6)The applicants were awarded costs."
621,"The unique aspect of this case is that although the DNA evidence establishes that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither the accused nor the complainant, due to their respective self-induced states of intoxication, have any memory of the sexual intercourse that took place between them.","The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code.
Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication.
Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent.
HELD: The accused was found guilty.
 1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities.
He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.
 2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent.
The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent.
The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief.
It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out.
She was incapable of giving consent after that time.
Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence.
It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality.
His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others.
The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society.
Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society.
The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness.
Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent.
The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication."
622,"The question remains what if any notice, can the Court adduce from the blood alcohol reading of Ms. Knox at 12:10 to 12:15 p.m. on October 17th, 1999 or the purported extrapolation of that blood alcohol reading back to the time of the operation of the vehicle by Ms. Knox at approximately 11:00 a.m. of the same day.","The accused was charged with impaired driving causing bodily harm.
Expert evidence was given based on blood samples taken after the accident that the accused was impaired; this opinion was based on two assumptions, namely, that the accused had not consumed alcohol within half an hour of the accident, nor after the accident.
The Crown did not offer any evidence to prove these assumptions and, in fact, there was a three hour period prior to the accident where there was no evidence of what the accused, who did not testify, was doing.
Acquitting the accused,
that the expert evidence cannot be tendered by the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had been impaired.
The remainder of the evidence against the accused was insufficient to prove the accused's doubt beyond a reasonable doubt."
623,"Under the terms of this ""top lease"" Mr. Taylor granted petroleum rights in the same half section to Freeholders upon expiration of the Imperial Oil lease dated April 26, 1949.[2] [5] Since the threshold issue at trial was whether this agreement of August 7, 1950 was void by reason of the common law rule against perpetuities, we find it convenient to reproduce the relevant parts of it: AND WHEREAS by Petroleum and Natural Gas Lease dated the ""26th"" day of ""April"", A.D. 19""49"", (hereinafter referred to as ""the drilling lease""), made between the GRANTOR as lessor and ""Imperial Oil Limited"" (hereinafter called ""the lessee""), the GRANTOR has demised and leased to the LESSEE the petroleum, natural gas and related hydro‑carbons within, upon or under the above described land subject to the payment to the GRANTOR of gross royalty of twelve and one‑half per cent.","The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease.
In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959.
The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993.
After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner.
The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence.
HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V.
The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench.
1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule.
The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive.
The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society.
The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times.
Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae.
Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule.
Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.
 2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease.
The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed.
The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general.
The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property.
A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough.
The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision.
The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease.
As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971.
The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future.
The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely."
624,"March 9, 2001 [1] The plaintiff, Maher Hanna, a medical doctor, brings this action against the defendants, Ettienne Crouse and David Kirsch, also medical doctors, alleging that each of them owed a duty of trust and a fiduciary duty to act towards him in good faith in connection with an arrangement entered into by all of them to perform the on-call services required of each of them by the defendant, Pipestone District Health Board.","The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board.
Under the voluntary arrangement doctors who chose not to enter the arrangement remained on-call to look after their own patients and to respond to emergencies.
It worked well until Hanna established another clinic and began dividing his time between Regina and the Moosomin clinic.
HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.
 1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct.
When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him.
Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital.
He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence.
He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days.
Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition.
His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors.
The on-call arrangement was voluntary.
There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood.
There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.
 4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District.
Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons.
A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors.
There was no basis in law or fact supporting the existence of a fiduciary relationship between Hanna and the Health District."
625,"[3] The defendant, Les Oblats de Marie Immaculee du Manitoba, is also ready for trial (except for some minor matters) and concurs that the issues raised by the claim of the plaintiff should proceed to trial at this time.","FIAT. The applicant applied for an order severing the issues from those raised by the cross-claim and third party proceedings so that his claim may proceed to trial.
The Attorney General opposed severance on the ground the Government of Canada would be prejudiced in its claim for apportionment of the amount of any judgment as between the Government of Canada and the Oblates.
HELD: It was in the best interests of justice that the order of severance be granted so the issue may proceed to an early trial.
The issues of cross-claim and third party proceedings will take a very lengthy period of time.
Hundreds of other claimants who have been asked by the management pre-trial judge to regard the plaintiff's action as a test case were awaiting a judgment."
626,"of the 1954 Act which provided: Where cause of action survives for the benefit of the estate of deceased person, only damages that have resulted in actual pecuniary loss to the estate are recoverable; and in no case are damages recoverable for: (a) punitive and exemplary matters; (b) loss of expectation of life; (c) pain and suffering.","A fifteen year old died in a motor vehicle accident.
The estate brought a claim for loss of future income and lost earning capacity.
The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate."
627,"[35] Despite the foregoing, have concluded that Mr. Burton possessed sufficient understanding of each of the following: (a) the reason for the police officer’s attendance at the hospital, (b) the demand which was made on him, (c) the opportunity which was being given to him to consult with lawyer and (d) that what was being sought, the blood samples, related to impaired driving and would put him in legal jeopardy. 10(v) Charter rights at time when he was capable of appreciating and understanding the rights and that Mr. Burton gave an informed waiver as that is understood from R.","The accused was charged with operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit and impaired driving.
After being involved in an accident, the accused was taken to hospital where a blood demand was given and eventually acceded to.
The accused challenged the validity of the blood demand and argued that his right to counsel was violated.
Accused guilty of operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit; there was no violation of the accused's right to counsel.
The officer had valid grounds to make the demand, having been advised that the accused was in an accident, that someone had said the accused was either high or intoxicated, having smelled a mild odour of alcohol on the accused and the accused having advised him that he only had three beer.
Even if the accused's claim to amnesia for all the events around that time was believed, there was no medical evidence to suggest that he could not understand what the officer said to him at the hospital.
Although his degree of alertness may have fluctuated, he displayed an understanding of the situation by showing appropriate concern for how much he had been drinking and asking questions which showed an understanding of his situation and what speaking to counsel would entail."
628,"I, after reading your protocol, thought that could instruct him to just swear the Information to Obtain before Commissioner of Oaths, but then when began reading the section and reading the form itself THE COURT: Do you see anything in the section, Mr. Parker, as opposed to the form? 487.1, which is the general warrant provision, doesn’t have a form, but even if it did have a form and it used the same words, “taken before me”, that to require that the Information be sworn before the Provincial Court Judge elevates form over substance in a significant way, particularly in the context of the concerns that I raised in that decision about the potential prejudicial or negative effects of a personal attendance before the judge.","An application for a DNA warrant on the basis s.487.05 (the general warrant provision) of the Criminal Code with respect to DNA warrants does not refer to a form.
The applicant suggested a tape recording would avoid the potential problems in bringing the application before a Provincial Court Judge.
HELD: These concerns were raised in the January 21 decision concerning potential prejudicial or negative effects, which outweigh any requirement to swear the Information before a judge.
An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance.
The intention is to make protocol work as flexible as possible, not impeding the police in their legitimate role, while making sure the court maintains its independence.
Form 5.01 is specifically set out in the Code.
Section 487.1 does not have a form, but even if it did and used the same words 'taken before me', that would elevate form over substance in a significant way."
629,"Further, even if jurisdiction over the person was lost in Alberta, that jurisdiction was regained, according to the Crown, when the respondent attended court in Saskatchewan on May 7, 2001, as result of summons that must have issued within three months of February 6, 2001 (date of loss of jurisdiction in Alberta). By the time the respondent appeared in court in Saskatchewan (May 7, 2001) the charges in Alberta were already deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution.","The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08.
The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law.
Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months.
Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges.
At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law.
HELD: The Informations were stayed.
The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction.
1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution.
Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis).
The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001.
A summons was not issued until August.
The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3).
'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'.
It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court.
Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location.
The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first.
3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta.
The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001.
The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3).
There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken.
The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances.
4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process.
The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress.
The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice.
The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process."
630,The Registrar of the Provincial Court had advised the applicant that it must apply to the appropriate court with notice to the Crown for an order to obtain access to the CD-ROM. [9] therefore declare that the applicant is granted access to the CD-ROM entered as an exhibit in the Jones sentencing.,"FIAT. Saskatoon's daily newspaper applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing in the matter of R. v. Glen Ivor Jones on May 14, 2002.
The journalists had no prior opportunity to hear its contents because Jones entered a guilty plea.
The application was not opposed.
The applicant sought an order for mandamus or a declaration.
HELD: The presumption is in favour of public access to court records and the burden to contrary proof lies with the person who would deny access.
This right is tempered by other factors (see R. v. SJS).
Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General and playing the CD ROM and making their own notes balances the interests of innocent parties whose conversations were recorded."
631,"R. 295 similarly observed that in determining whether an ""adult child"" in attendance at university qualifies as ""child"" under the Act and, if so, the extent of the obligation of parents to support their child: [10] requires the court to consider many factors including: whether the child is eligible for student loans or other financial assistance, whether the chid has reasonable career plans, the ability of the child to contribute to his or her own support through part-time employment, parental plans for the child's education, particularly those made during cohabitation, and at least in the case of mature child who has reached the age of majority, whether or not the child has unilaterally terminated his or her relationship with the parent from whom child support is sought.","Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278.
He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time.
The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies.
He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit.
The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time.
Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans.
The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans.
At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001.
HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines.
Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act.
They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents.
It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a).
The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees.
The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs.
The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay.
Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month.
The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.
 3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance.
The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2).
A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald.
It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget.
To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency.
4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due.
If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750."
632,"Although the Agency had problems with the timing of his complaints against N.D. and access supervision, Mr. Moore indicated that they felt that R.M. had positive input in the raising of S.M. and maintaining the household in the earlier years prior to the Bryson assessment. R.M. indicates that he has called Children’s Aid approximately five (5) times in the last two (2) years twice looking for provisions and three (3) times to complain about N.D.’s care.","The Agency applied for the permanent care of four young children, aged 2 to 5 years.
The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents.
The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing.
Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children.
The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents.
The biological father had custody of her at the present time.
The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children.
Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned.
Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province.
Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met.
The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them.
Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional.
Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future."
633,"Q-1.01 in accordance with minutes of settlement agreed to by the parties following a pre-trial conference on July 16, 2002.","An application for summary judgment pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184(1)(a) and/or Queen's Bench Act s.29 in accordance with the minutes of settlement agreed to follow the pre-trial conference.
The defendant did not file affidavit evidence but opposed the application solely on the basis that recent amendments to the Queen's Bench Act precludes reference to minutes of settlement.
HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to enter judgment for $15,000 plus costs of this application.
A settlement agreement reduced to writing in no way offends the confidentiality required under s.28.1.
The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to them in his affidavit.
Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to this situation.
If a party to an action is unable to enforce a concluded settlement, the pre-trial process becomes meaningless.
The legislation never intended such a result.
There was no suggestion that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settlement.
Nor was it suggested the minutes were unclear or ambiguous.
The defendant did not allege the settlement was amended or altered or that the balance of $15,000 does not remain owing."
634,"[6] Support for the plaintiff’s submission that Nordstrom was ignorant of the beneficiary limitation in this case is said to be found in Nordstrom’s entry of Garry Mayer’s name as designated beneficiary on the application form and Lynn Mayer’s evidence that, subsequent to Mayer’s death and upon being apprised by her of the designation problem, Nordstrom had merely stated that he would need to look into the matter.","The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants.
The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son.
The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application.
However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered.
The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will.
The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister.
HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.
 1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning.
The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business.
The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation.
The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools.
The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss.
The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case."
635,"[8] It remains fore me to review the submissions of the parties and the materials presented at the hearing, most significantly the affidavits of counsel with attached medical and actuarial evidence, to determine if this material is of such complexity and of such technical nature that it could not be fully assessed by properly informed jury. In applications to strike out jury notice otherwise properly made judge must weigh the complexity of the evidence that will be adduced at trial against the longstanding, traditional and substantive right of applicant in Nova Scotia to jury trial.","The defendant doctor in a personal injury case applied to set aside the Jury Notice filed by the plaintiff.
Application dismissed;
the evidence would not be so complex and scientific that the plaintiff's substantive right to a jury trial should be denied.
Although the medical charts exceeded 1500 pages, the more relevant hospital records were less than 100 pages; the essence of the liability issue would be limited in time, in the most relevant anatomical area and in the number of medical personnel involved in the relevant interventions; the factual material did not appear to be in dispute; and the issues were no more complex than most causation issues presented in medical malpractice cases."
636,"[14] The Youth Criminal Justice Act provides the following on the matter of interim judicial release for charge of murder: 33 (8) If young person against whom proceedings have been taken under this Act is charged with an offence referred to in section 522 of the Criminal Code, youth justice court judge, but no other court, judge or justice, may release the young person from custody under that section.","The accused made an application to the Court of Queen's Bench under s. 515 of the Criminal Code and s. 33(8) and s. 13(2) of The Youth Criminal Justice Act for interim judicial release of the accused pending his preliminary inquiry on a charge of murder.
The accused had previously applied to a Provincial Court judge, who had declined the accused's application.
The issue was whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused's application for judicial interim release.
HELD: The jurisdiction for determination of interim judicial release of a young person charged with murder under the Youth Criminal Justice Act rests solely with the superior court of criminal jurisdiction, which is the Court of Queen's Bench in Saskatchewan."
637,"MERITORIOUS CLAIM [35] It is submitted that the order should be denied because the plaintiff fits within Queens’ Bench Rule 539(a) which provides: 539 In exercising its discretion under rule 537, the court may consider any relevant matter, including the following factors that may support the denial of an order for security for costs: (c) there is good reason to believe that the pleadings or position of the party in the proceeding have merit; Quite frankly, cannot assess with any confidence the merit of the plaintiff’s claim.","FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000.
HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000.
1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court.
The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.
 2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs.
Rather, it is a factor to be considered.
In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim.
It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3)
The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action.
Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate.
It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding.
4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated.
The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000.
The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant."
638,"s. 20 Subject to these regulations, victim’s gross yearly employment income not derived from self-employment at the time of the accident is the sum of the following amounts: (c) in the case of non-earner, the salary or wages, excluding benefits or commissions in clauses (d) or (e), from an employment that the non-earner would have held, if the accident had not occurred, during the first 180 days after the date of the accident divided by the number of days the employment would have been held and then multiplied by 365; [5] Counsel for the appellant called Wayne Cowan, president of CLC Logging Ltd., to testify on Montgrand’s behalf and to give evidence of employment that he would have provided for Montgrand but for the intervening accident.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act.
Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts.
The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator.
The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000.
This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident.
The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year.
HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality.
The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment.
The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.
 2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle.
There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3)
Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101."
639,"In 2000 Mr. Faddoul’s appraiser valued the property at $695,000 for mortgage purposes. $368,328 Mr. Faddoul pays Ms. Faddoul to equalize division of property [90] therefore order that Mr. Faddoul pay Ms. Faddoul the sum of $27,153 to effect an equal division of matrimonial property.","The parties were married for 13 years and had three children.
Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents.
The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college.
In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties.
Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided.
The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property.
This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture.
A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed.
This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset."
640,"[48] The affidavits and the briefs filed with the Court prior to the parties signing their Agreement, make it abundantly clear that the Applicant was aware of the Respondent’s income potential and the challenges she would be facing given her circumstances including her age and her years out of the workforce.","Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement.
Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support.
The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years.
She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000.
The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent.
Application dismissed;
the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed.
Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement."
641,"[1] It will not be necessary for us to call upon counsel for the respondent, Ken Yaganiski, for each of us is of the view that, even if his conduct constituted breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, Belterra Corporation, Belterra failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach.","The appellant appeal arguing that the respondent's conduct in soliciting the customers of the appellant constituted a breach of contract.
HELD: Appeal dismissed orally.
Even if the respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, the appellant failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach.
The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit.
This loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did.
As the trial judge found, the termination of the distributorship was unconnected to the respondent."
642,"April 19, 2006 1) This is an action by the plaintiffs, Cattell, Mack, Bosenberg and Strassburg pursuant to Part Forty of The Queen’s Bench Rules for damages arising to them from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd., and for a permanent injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the property of the plaintiffs.","The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course.
The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property.
HELD: 1)
The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance.
It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property.
Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property.
In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward.
There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.
 2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties.
The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem.
Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude.
3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year.
4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years.
The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property."
643,[27] Placing Tyson in the home of Rocky as his primary residence because of the relocation of Shauna to the Archerwill district must be considered in the context of the impact that such change would have on him. [32] It is clear to me that the only viable options at this time are to either permit Shauna to relocate Tyson to the Archerwill district or to change the primary residence of Tyson by placing him in the home of Rocky.,"The respondent applies to vary the consent joint custody order granted in October 2004.
His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson.
The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson.
HELD: 1)
The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent.
This also requires a change in access arrangements.
These are changes in circumstances that are material.
 2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson.
The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey.
After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child.
Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis.
Even telephone access has been sporadic.
Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3)
The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation.
The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support.
4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson.
It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to.
The petitioner has always been Tyson's primary caregiver.
The petitioner is the psychological parent."
644,"Therefore, it is submitted, there is no dispute of fact or issue of credibility raised by Mr. Wilson’s statement to Mr. Zaun and, as result, no evidence identifying Mr. Hogeterp’s dog.","A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway.
An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway.
The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway.
When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed.
Appeal dismissed.
At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit.
It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit.
Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved."
645,"[2] As ground of appeal, the appellant asserts palpable and overriding error by the learned trial judge in accepting, and finding as fact, part of the testimony of witness (that an amount was owing by the appellant to the respondent) but not accepting the further testimony of the witness that an amount was also owing to the appellant by the respondent. [5] As to the issue under appeal, in his judgment the trial judge referred to the appellant’s evidence of loaning the respondent $1,900.00 in 2003 for the purpose of funding repairs to the respondent’s car.","This is an appeal pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act, 1997.
The appellant asserts a palpable and overriding error by the learned trial judge in accepting, and finding as fact, part of the testimony of a witness but not accepting the further testimony of the witness that an amount was also owing to the appellant by the respondent.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed.
The trial judge was not required to accept the entirety of the witness's testimony, despite having accepted most of it, particularly in light of the contradictory evidence of the respondent denying the sum claimed by the appellant.
The denial by the respondent of the appellant's claim, accepted by the trial judge, was fatal to the appellant's onus of proving a mutual understanding and absolute acknowledgement of the alleged debt between the parties."
646,"(3d) 193 (SCC)) as follows: 35 Bernshaw makes it clear that the mere possibility that driver has consumed alcohol within 15 minutes before taking the test does not preclude an officer from relying on the accuracy of the statutorily approved screening device. Where an officer honestly and reasonably concludes on the basis of available information that he can form no opinion as to whether the driver consumed alcohol within the prior 15 to 20 minutes, the officer is entitled to rely on the accuracy of the statutorily approved screening device and administer the test without delay.","The accused was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08.
The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated.
The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand.
HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test.
A new trial is ordered.
 1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test.
In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene.
Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2)
The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3)
The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'.
Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame.
Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation."
647,"said: “It seems absurd to suggest that lawfully licensed driver operating properly licensed automobile or truck on highway would be liable for violations of the Motor Vehicle Act such as speeding or imprudent driving, while person operating an off-highway vehicle on highway could not be subject to the same obligations and be liable for the same penalties for such violations” [10] It seems apparent, therefore, that one must consider the context in which the words “motor vehicle” are used within the sections of the Motor Vehicle Act to determine whether the provision applies to the use of ATV’s or other prohibited vehicles.","The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked when he was found operating an all terrain vehicle (ATV) on a highway.
Accused found not guilty;
the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle.
Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway."
648,"52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act S.S. 1990-91, c.S 63.1, peace officer who finds person in public place and whom the peace officer reasonably believes, (i) is intoxicated due to the use of alcohol; and (ii) if not detained is likely to cause injury to himself or herself or be danger or disturbance to others and there is no other person capable and willing to take care of the person, may take that person into custody. Members of the public have the right to walk up and knock on doors unless previously requested not to do so.[2] In any event, the accused began to yell at the officers prior to his arrest when he was in the parking lot which is, without any doubt, public place.","The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code.
The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention.
The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public.
HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act.
There was a complaint to police concerning the accused.
He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment.
He smelled of alcohol.
He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police.
Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol.
He was causing a disturbance to others.
Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place.
No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused.
The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication.
The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go.
In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest.
There was no such person in this case.
The arrest was, on these facts, lawful."
649,"In the circumstances of this case that required consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant’s personal circumstances impacting on her ability to personally attend the hearing on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the requested adjournment were to be granted.","The tenant appeals the decision of the Hearing Officer granting her landlord a possession order of her rental premises.
The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning.
She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally.
The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend.
HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date.
The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties.
This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted.
There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer.
Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing.
It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be.
On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend.
Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved.
The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process.
The reasonableness standard of review applies here."
650,"Susan Elaine Ostrom, Executrix of the Estate of Ezra Morrell Susan Elaine Ostrom, Walter Ostrom and Ingrid Ostrom Respondents Judge: The Honourable Justice Oland Appeal Heard: September 9, 2009 Final Submissions Received: November 16, 2009 Subject: Wills Separation Agreements Renunciation of Testamentary Gifts Summary: A couple signed a separation agreement which included a provision whereby they agreed to renounce and waive any claim in the estate of the other and any right to share in the estate of the other. 2. By failing to consider whether Ingrid Ostrom had immediately renounced her right to share in the deceased’s estate under the Will by signing the Separation Agreement or whether she had contractually bound herself to renounce any inheritance after the death of Ezra Morrell.","A couple signed a separation agreement which included a provision whereby they agreed to renounce and waive any claim in the estate of the other and any right to share in the estate of the other, which terms were incorporated into a corollary relief judgment.
When he died, the former husband had not changed his will, which left the residue of his estate to his former wife.
The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift.
The mother of the deceased appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
although the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed, the appellant had failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death.
Even if the former spouse were so bound, there did not appear to be any privity of contract which would allow the appellant, who was not a party to the separation agreement, to enforce it."
651,"The agreement provided that the father was to get generous access on reasonable notice, the father was to pay the mother child support in the amount of $450 per month for each child and among other provisions, the father would maintain scholarship fund for the daughters’ education until they were 18. [42] In our view the other Farden and Zaba factors canvassed by the trial judge do not in and of themselves or together lead to the conclusion that the daughters are no longer “children of the marriage” within the meaning of the Act. It is clear that the daughters were not able to withdraw from the father’s charge for the purposes of their education after all the factors are considered and balanced, and that they are still “children of the marriage” and entitled to some maintenance during their post-secondary education theoretically starting September 2006.","The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support.
Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act.
The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.
 1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship.
The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship.
The relationship deteriorated in 2006.
It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain.
However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally.
The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records.
The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him.
The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters.
Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication.
2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father.
His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship.
The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way.
The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother.
This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally.
The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met."
652,"In summation, counsel for the Plaintiff confirmed that while he has raised number of issues concerning the Defendant’s handling of the Plaintiff’s criminal case both in the Statement of Claim and at trial, the alleged negligence and breach of contract claim is based on the Defendant’s failure to object to the admission into evidence of the opinion of the RCMP Traffic Analyst, the videotape re-enactment and the related still photographs all of which were found by the Court of Appeal to be inadmissible.","The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people.
He was charged with dangerous driving.
His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial.
At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment.
The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory.
As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination.
The plaintiff was convicted.
He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won.
Eventually, the charges were dropped.
The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal.
In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence.
They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury.
The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract.
The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions.
Action dismissed.
The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer.
Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result.
Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case.
The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions.
While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate."
653,"[20] Having reviewed the Stated Case throughly as well as the Notice of Appeal and, having considered the submissions of both the Appellant and the Respondent, the Court is not satisfied that there was failure to follow the requirements of natural justice The Appellant by his own admission was notified as to the hearing date, and by his own admission he chose to ignore it and make no further inquiries .","The small claims adjudicator granted an order for substituted service after the respondent had trouble serving the appellant with notice of her claim.
As per the order, she personally served the appellant's mother and notified the appellant of the hearing date by text message.
He didn't appear and default judgement was granted against the appellant in the amount of $11,031.35.
The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice.
He denied being in contact with his mother.
He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries.
New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal.
Appeal dismissed.
The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny.
Here the respondent's claim was valid.
The adjudicator had the jurisdiction/authority to make an order for substituted service and the respondent followed it.
At the very least, the appellant was notified of the hearing dates by text message(s).
While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set.
He failed to prove he had a reasonable excuse for defaulting, chose to ignore the notice, and was mistaken only as to what would be the outcome if he failed to appear."
654,"[5] In the course of argument, the trial judge said he did not understand why the defect, if there was one, could not be cured by severing count 4, the charge concerning the driving while disqualified offence. More specifically, Mr. Rathgeber contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction.","The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.
He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code.
The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty.
The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings.
That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court.
At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity.
He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.'
The trial judge dismissed the application to quash.
He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways:
The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.'
Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed.
The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record.
The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench.
In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety.
Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count.
More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction.
This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed.
The test for apprehension of bias is well settled.
The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.).
The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude.
It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories.
The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making.
Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial.
No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information."
655,"(d) subject to sections 11 to 21, no person shall commence an action with respect to farm land; 11(1) Where mortgagee makes an application with respect to mortgage on farm land, the court may, on any terms and conditions that it considers just and equitable: (a) order that clause 9(1)(d) or section 10 does not apply; or (b) make an order for the purposes of clause 9(1)(f).","The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits.
The defendant failed to make any payment.
The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale.
The defendant was a developer.
He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act.
The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price.
HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply.
The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA.
There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision.
The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants.
The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price.
Normal bidding rules shall apply.
The plaintiff was entitled to costs."
656,"Dr. Rubin claims these statements were publicly communicated by the defendants by means of notices posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff’s workplace, by means of mass mailing to all members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 1975 (“CUPE”) and by means of posting on the CUPE website.","The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants.
He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process.
The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college.
He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website.
The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself.
The plaintiff seeks damages and costs.
He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable.
He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD:
The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.).
In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed.
The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege.
This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth).
The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers.
The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz).
The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body.
In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college.
The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege.
This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty.
The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties.
The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice.
There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds.
Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis.
There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident.
The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000.
Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs."
657,"66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations, 1987 by itself does not allege an offence because although it purports to prohibit the use of certain tinted windows on vehicles, it does not provide that the contravention of the prohibition is an offence that carries with it penalty. is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction: (a) in the case of an individual, to fine of not more than $1,000; and [22] Accordingly, it is not an offence to possess vehicle that has after‑market tinted windows; however, it is an offence, punishable by fine of up to $1,000.00, to operate or cause to be operated motor vehicle on public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations (i.e., s.","The accused was charged with having aftermarket tint on the side windows of his vehicle.
He appealed on other grounds.
The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion.
The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations.
HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established.
Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty.
The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations.
The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio.
The conviction was quashed."
658,"The defendants were granted leave to appeal only that portion of the certification order that pertained to the cause of action relating to alleged breaches of The Consumer Protection Act, S.S. 1996, c.","A class action was certificated at Queen's Bench on the basis of breaches of The Consumer Protection Act and a breach of duty of care.
The defendants were granted leave from the Court of Appeal to appeal the portion of the certification order dealing with alleged breaches of The Consumer Protection Act only.
The certification on the basis of duty of care was upheld.
As a result, a situation existed where the class action process could continue on only part of the claim until the appeal of consumer protection act issues was heard.
HELD: Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules is engaged and the entire certification judgment is stayed pending the disposition of the appeal.
If the plaintiffs wish to apply to lift the stay they must do so to a judge of the Court of Appeal."
659,"In reply, Waterbury Newton argued that Marineserve can be distinguished on the following bases: In Marineserve, the delay in bringing an application was only six months whereas, in this case, Mr. Newton’s delay was 26 months; In Marineserve, the court recognized that timeliness was an issue but was satisfied that Maritime Harbours raised the question of arbitration at an early stage; In Marineserve, Justice Goodfellow characterized the litigation as “not yet out of the starting gate”; Unlike the applicant in Marineserve, Mr. Newton furthered the litigation process by agreeing to, and attending discoveries and providing documents; Section of the Nova Scotia Arbitration Act is more specific than Section of the Canadian Commercial Arbitration Act.",". This was an interlocutory, discretionary decision and the chambers judge did not apply a wrong principle of law or make a clearly erroneous finding of fact, nor has there been a patent injustice.
A decision on the corollary issue of whether the proceeding should have taken place under Rule 4.07 (dismissal for want of jurisdiction) or Rule 88.02 (abuse of process) is unnecessary."
660,"[4] How the police came to arrive and search the home in Gillisdale, Inverness County, Nova Scotia was described by the trial judge in his voir dire decision reported as 2009 NSSC 407 (CanLII): [3] Facts: On October 10, 2008, at approximately 10:30 p.m., Nadine Shaw (then age 24 years) telephoned her mother Peggy Shaw. Police Entry [38] In his voir dire decision, the trial judge stated that in the circumstances, including the perceived scream, the police had a responsibility to enter the residence, whether invited or not, and that their warrantless entry, search of Mr. Timmons’ person, and search of his house did not breach his s.","The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused.
Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police.
They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside.
Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home.
The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home.
From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom.
They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants.
During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found.
The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants.
Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant.
Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners.
The defendant appealed.
Appeal allowed; conviction set aside;
although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis.
Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant.
Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises."
661,"[65] I am satisfied on the basis of the Statutory Declaration and on the totality of the evidence that Eldred Longard, his sons Roy and David, and others accessing their properties from Highway No. 3 by use of ""the Borden driveway"", did so with the permission of Borden.","After a piece of family property was divided into two parcels, one of the brothers continued to use a driveway and maintain a garden on the other parcel.
When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times.
When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription.
He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission.
Judgment for the defendants;
there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway.
Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission."
662,"[17] What occurred obviously constituted an assault, however, I was left with determining the issue in count #1 whether or not a defence of self defence was available to the accused, and on count #2 whether or not Hujber was properly identified and therefore properly acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time that this incident occurred.","The accused was a passenger in a van where the driver was stunting on the complainant's street.
The complainant was an off duty police officer who left his home and knocked on the passenger window.
The accused exited the van and assaulted the complainant resulting in the complainant receiving a broken nose and ankle.
The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer.
The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident.
HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer.
1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed.
Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.
 2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other.
The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer."
663,"It reads as follows: (1) Subject to subsection (2), if justice is satisfied, on an information on oath in Form or on an information on oath submitted to the justice pursuant to section 487.1 by telephone or other means of telecommunication, that there are reasonable grounds to believe that (a) person has, within the preceding four hours, committed, as result of the consumption of alcohol, an offence under section 253 and that person was involved in an accident resulting in the death of another person or in bodily harm to himself or herself or to any other person, and (b) qualified medical practitioner is of the opinion that (i) by reason of any physical or mental condition of the person that resulted from the consumption of alcohol, the accident or any other occurrence related to or resulting from the accident, the person is unable to consent to the taking of samples of his blood, and (ii) the taking of samples of blood from the person would not endanger the life or health of the person, the justice may issue warrant authorizing peace officer to require qualified medical practitioner to take, or to cause to be taken by qualified technician under the direction of the qualified medical practitioner, such samples of the blood of the person as in the opinion of the person taking the samples are necessary to enable proper analysis to be made in order to determine the concentration, if any, of alcohol in his blood.","The accused was charged with impaired care and control of a motor vehicle and care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08.
The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals.
His body was slumped over into the passenger side.
The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage.
The engine was running when the police arrived.
There was no one else in the vehicle.
The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant.
The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol.
The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain.
The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle.
HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8.
The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle.
The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious.
Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code.
However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis.
The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain.
The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights.
The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis.
The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision.
There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle.
The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08.
The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%."
664,[2] This application deals with an application by Ms. Nygren for payment by Mr. Johnson of his pro rata share of the costs for Amanda’s post-secondary education expenses. (2nd Supp.) and an order requiring ongoing and retroactive payments by Mr. Johnson for some of Amanda Nygren’s extraordinary expenses for post-secondary education.,"The petitioner brought an application to compel the respondent to pay his pro rata share of the costs for the child's post-secondary education expenses.
The petitioner had previously been ordered to pay $1,000 in costs to the respondent but instead paid the $1,000 directly into the child's credit card balance and there was no evidence that this was done by mutual agreement between the parties.
The child was not performing well in her program with no explanation for her poor performance.
HELD The burden is on the petitioner to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence.
Although the child is a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act during the time she was attending classes, her expenses are excessive.
The child provided no evidence to rebut the respondent's information that she did not attend many of her classes.
The child must take greater responsibility for her own expenses and debts if she does not apply herself to her studies.
The respondent was ordered to match the amount paid by the petitioner towards the child's expenses.
The costs owed by the petitioner to the respondent are set-off against the amount owing; the respondent shall pay $3,452 to the child's outstanding debts by or before February 15, 2011."
665,"[21] By resolution, the Board of the Condominium Corporation determined that the following interpretation is, has been and continues to be the Board’s interpretation of the bylaws: That the Board of Directors hereby confirms that since October 9, 2009 it has been, and that it continues to be the opinion of the Board that the following is the proper interpretation of Section 3.3 of the Bylaws of the Corporation, where the Board is to consist, as it does now, of seven members: (a) The Commercial Owners are entitled to nominate up to persons for election to the Board; (b) All owners, residential and commercial, are entitled to vote on all nominees to the Board; (c) All owners have agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the Commercial Owners’ nominees and where the owners neglect or refuse to cast their votes in such manner, the Commercial Owners may vote separately as class to elect their nominees; and (d) There is no restriction in the Bylaw limiting the right of the Commercial Owners to vote on positions to the Board.","The applicant is a residential unit owner in the condominium corporation.
He sought a declaration pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 interpreting the bylaws of the condominium corporation with respect to the voting rights of the commercial unit owners.
The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units.
The remaining 29 units are residential.
The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors.
A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders.
The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board.
HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw.
There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners.
Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting.
The proper interpretation of the bylaws has nothing to do with the principles of contract interpretation.
The application was dismissed.
The interpretation of the bylaw by the Board of Directors was reasonable and that Court was not prepared to interfere with it."
666,"[9] In their Notice of Motion, the Applicants rely upon Civil Procedure Rules 37.02 and 37.03 which read: 37.02 judge may order consolidation of proceedings if the proceedings to be consolidated are of the same kind, that is to say, actions, applications, applications for judicial review, or appeals, and one of the following conditions is met: (a) common question of law or fact arises in the proceedings; (b) same ground of judicial review or appeal is advanced in the applications for judicial review or appeals and the ground involves the same or similar decision-makers; (c) claims, grounds, or defences in the actions or applications involve the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences; (d) consolidation is, otherwise, in the interests of the parties.",",  motion denied.
The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions.
The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation.
The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation.
The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions.
The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court.
The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants.
The court dismissed the motion."
667,"[4] It is, of course, always open to Ms Thompson to apply to the Court of Queen’s Bench for an order requiring Carry the Kettle First Nation to provide further and better particulars should she find herself in the position of not knowing with sufficient certainty of the case she will be expected to meet in the respects under consideration.","The appellants appealed the order of a Queen's Bench chamber's judge striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim.
HELD: The chamber's judge was in error in striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim.
The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application.
The Court of Appeal opted to deal with the merits of the application themselves, rather than remitting the matter back to Queen's Bench.
While the allegation of fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, the pleading is nevertheless sufficient to answer the requirements of QB Rule 173.
The appellants should have been given an opportunity to amend their pleadings.
The appeal was allowed and the application to strike was dismissed without prejudice to respondent's right to seek further particulars."
668,"(Williams, para 28) [18] There is nothing in the decision appealed from to suggest the hearing officer either considered the evidence or argument put forth by the tenants. [Emphasis Added] [19] It is not apparent from the decision appealed from whether the hearing officer considered the tenant's evidence, made findings of fact in that regard or for that matter considered whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in the circumstances before her.","The tenants appealed a decision of a hearing officer under s. 72 of The Residential Tenancies Act.
The hearing officer determined that the landlord's claim for non-payment of rent had been established and that an order for possession as warranted.
The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent.
The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem.
They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal.
HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs.
However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient.
The Court held that it was impossible to tell whether the hearing officer considered the tenants' evidence at the hearing, made findings of fact in that regard or whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in this situation.
The reasons are inadequate to allow a meaningful review of the decision."
669,"9, Justice McIntyre summarized the process of determining whether to grant leave to add third party under that Act: (a) determination should be made as to whether the third party notice establishes prima facie claim against the proposed third party; (b) If it does, then determination of whether causal connection exists between the cause of action pled in the statement of claim and the cause of action pled in the third party notice is necessary; (c) If there is causal connection the application may be dismissed where extreme hardship or prejudice would result and directions cannot materially relieve against it. [8] Hence, the issue before the Chambers judge was to determine whether MacPherson had filed material which established prima facie claim against the City and whether there was any prejudice to the plaintiff if the Third Party Claim was grafted onto the plaintiff’s action.","SGI applied on behalf of the defendant for an order under Queen's Bench Rule 107A(c) and s. 7 of The Contributory Negligence Act for leave to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party to the action.
The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage caused to a construction site under a bridge in Saskatoon.
The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit.
The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of.
HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted.
The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party.
There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer.
There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice.
It is immaterial at this stage that the City may have an absolute defence."
670,"At the time of the judgment, what was known to both sides was that the husband had RRSPs of $111,617 but discounted in value to $83,751.15 for purposes of family property division. The wife having laid out discounted values for the RRSPs, one would expect the husband to have demanded explicit language in the judgment if he wanted to use unreduced RRSP values to satisfy the equalization payment.","The applicant wife sought an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered.
The consent judgment provided that the husband should make an equalization payment of $105,000 to be composed of cash and/or a rollover of retirement funds.
The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax.
Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000.
The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value.
The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application.
The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs.
Therefore, the Court ordered that the judgment be satisfied by way of rollover of RRSPs in the amount of $111,600."

It seemingly being considered against public policy as having tendency to promote litigation, and to prevent amicable settlements.” (ii) It is common sense that settlement is less likely if the parties do not engage in full and frank discussions; (iii) Few parties would initiate or participate in settlement negotiations at all if such could later be used to their detriment: “What sensible man would attempt settlement if it could be used against him at trial?” (William Allan Real Estate Co. v.","The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their children.
The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner.
The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal.
HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it.
The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it.

673,"[2] The applicant, Government of Saskatchewan, Victim Services Branch, has brought a motion before myself as the trial judge for an order permitting a live audio/video broadcast of the trial of this matter set to proceed on April 29, 2013, from a Court of Queen’s Bench courtroom in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, to a courtroom in a court house in the Greater Toronto area, Ontario, for the exclusive benefit of the family of Bert Haverkort, deceased.","The applicant, the Government of Saskatchewan Victim Services Branch requested an order permitting a live audio broadcast of the trial of the accused from a courtroom in Saskatoon to a courtroom in Toronto for the exclusive benefit of the family of the deceased victim.
The accused took no position.
HELD: The Court dismissed the application.
Making an order for video-conferencing for non- participating persons was not permitted because the Court had no control over the policing of the courtroom in Ontario.
It would set a dangerous precedent that could result in multiple applications being made in future trials by numerous interested parties in different jurisdictions over which the Court had no control."
674,"[6] The hearing officer in the alternative stated that if she was in error in this respect and it was fixed term tenancy, the fact the appellant did not advertise the premises for lease after receiving the September 18, 2012 notice from the respondent meant he did not within the meaning of s.","The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer.
The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012.
On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy.
The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice.
The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting.
He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1.
Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy.
The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act.
HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy.
The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term.
The appeal was allowed on this issue.
The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant.
The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss."
675,"The Charges [51] The accused is charged with 14 counts of indecent assault, which were committed at or near Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan in the time period between January 1, 1959 and December 31, 1967, upon 14 separate individuals: G.J.W., H.J.A., J.E., T.F., G.A.G., E.G., L.A.G., D.L., J.R.M., N.G.M., M.J.M., M.V.P., G.T., G.R.M. Whether there was an indecent assault of M.V.P. in the shower or whether there was only an attempt, the court accepts the evidence of M.V.P. that there was in fact an indecent assault in the bedroom of the accused when M.V.P. was approximately 15 years of age, and I find the Crown has proven the charge beyond a reasonable doubt and a conviction shall be entered to Count 14.",HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of 10 counts and 7 counts were dismissed.
676,"also accept the opinion of the tenant’s expert in the field of installation and physical properties of floor coverings: after examining the building on two separate occasions and observing the cumulate effects of water infiltration into the building over time, particularly the standing water in the basement, (which must be resolved before any remedial work is undertaken) the witness was unequivocal that the movement and instability of the subfloor is primarily the result of moisture arising from structural defects in the building, and that only small percentage, perhaps 25%, of the cause of the lifting and cracking of the floor tiles could be attributed to poor maintenance lack of sufficient polish and waxing.","HELD: The Court held that the cause of the damage was high humidity in the building caused by water leaking into it from the roof.
The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor.
The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years.
As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years.
The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed.
The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800.
Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836.
The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500."
677,"60 of the trial judgment: “In the circumstances of this case, am not satisfied that the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that the speed of the accused’s vehicle was anything more than 93 to 99 kilometres per hour or that it was objectively dangerous in the circumstances.” Later in the paragraph, the trial judge again subjected the evidence going to Mr. Alves’ speed to the criminal standard and seemed to suggest that because he thought the issue needed to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, he could not accept evidence that suggested without definitively proving that Mr. Alves was going faster than 93-99 kilometres per hour.","The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed.
The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal.
The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so.
The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony.
The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed.
The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous.
The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial.
The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial.
The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial.
Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge."

The court held that pursuant to s. 39(9), it ordered that the transcript should be allowed to be filed and the appeal to proceed.

683,Should the support obligation be varied to reflect lower income than that which was imputed to the respondent in the original order of McIntyre J.? 1. Should the support obligation be varied to reflect lower income than that which was imputed to the respondent in the original order of McIntyre J.?,"HELD: The application was dismissed.
The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005.
The court assumed that the imputation was correct.
The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012.
From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office.
The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them.
The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income."
684,For the reasons given above do not find the allegations of pornography and masturbation addictions or the suggested risk of sexual abuse of the children by the respondent are justification or proper basis to exclude the respondent from the family home or such as to give the petitioner an enhanced right to possession over the respondent.,"HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made.
The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography.
The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner.
The petitioner did not dispute that evidence.
The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions.
The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction.
The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent.
With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated.
The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD.
The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent.
It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis.
A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children.
The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting.
The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children."

The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest.
The child had lived with them since birth.
The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born.
The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences.
The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges.
The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents.
Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order.
Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child.
Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child.
Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate.
| HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order.
That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father.
The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions.
On their own, such statements were insufficient.
There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change.
These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother."
686,"35.1, the starting point for the commencement of the limitation period is not the date of seizure as contended by Mr. Butler but the date when the director became satisfied that the property constitutes proceeds of unlawful activity.","HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure.
The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure.
The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability.
The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application.
The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective.
Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity.
The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act.
An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016.
The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period.
The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;
 2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply.
The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade.
The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000.
The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice.
The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted."
687,"B. Conviction and sentence [23] The trial judge accepted the complainant’s evidence and made the following findings of fact: (i) the appellant and the complainant were at the appellant’s house; (ii) the appellant asked the complainant to join him in his bedroom; and (iii) after talking for while in the bedroom, the parties had sexual intercourse.","HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed.
The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation.
The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced.
The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one.
She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence.
The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony; 
2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference.
He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA.
The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016.
Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice.
To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society.
The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation."

In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial.
Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial.
It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process."

C-29.01, SS 2012, you are hereby given Notice that constitutional question will be argued by defence on the validity of section 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fisheries Regulations, 1995, made pursuant to The Fisheries Act, RSC, 1985, F-14 that purports to: a.) Restrict the accused’s Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food in the Jans Bay (Canoe Lake) geographical area as defined by the Saskatchewan regulation; b.) Infringe upon the accused’s Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food, as protected by Section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.","/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry.
The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food.
He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike.
The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish.
The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round.
The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence.
Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights.
The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing.
The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning.
He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing.
The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n
HELD: The accused was found guilty.
The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone."
690,"However, its position is that: The licences were only valid for their specified growing location in Ontario and not at the accused’s site in Saskatchewan; The licences only permitted some 449 plants to be grown at those locations and not the some 700 plants that were being grown; If the accused were mistaken that these licences were validly in effect for their location that was mistake of law, not mistake of fact and thus is not defence for them; Notwithstanding the lease, which the Crown views as sham, the accused were in fact in control of the premises and actively participated in the husbandry of the plants and thus they were both producing and in possession of marihuana; The quantity of the marihuana being grown coupled with the conclusions to be drawn from their circumstances and various text messages they were involved in establishes they were producing the marihuana for the purposes of trafficking; and Based on the totality of the evidence, the only rational conclusion to be drawn in respect of the cash found in their residence is that it was property obtained by the commission of an indictable offence in Canada.","HELD: The accused were each acquitted of all charges.
The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation.
The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him.
Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G.
The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer."
691,2. Sentencing positions of the Crown and defence [5] It is the position of the Crown that global sentence of 15 years is appropriate in this case considering the multiple aggravating factors present including the use of firearm in the death of Tommy Fiddler; Gordon’s serious criminal record including 55 previous convictions 17 of which are for violent offences; Gordon being subject to firearms prohibition at the time of the offence; Gordon rewarding Tommy’s act of kindness in giving Gordon place to live with an act of violence and Gordon’s total lack of remorse.,"HELD: The court sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 10 years for the manslaughter conviction.
A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm.
The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary.
The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor.
The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence."

UNJUST ENRICHMENT CONSTRUCTIVE TRUST Mrs. Keddy claims that Mr. McGill has been unjustly enriched by virtue of her contributions of time and money during the period of their cohabitation and that she should be compensated by way of either constructive trust imposed upon his assets or damages.,"The parties lived together for some 12 years before separating in 1988.
The plaintiff was 53 and the defendant 60.
The plaintiff sought an order under the Partition Act for the partition and sale of two properties owned jointly and a division of property owned by the defendant based on a constructive trust.
The defendant owned and operated residential rental properties.
The plaintiff, who had stopped working as a medical records technician in 1988, maintained the household and assisted in the business by answering phones, bookkeeping, showing apartments and helping with minor repairs.
(1) that the plaintiff met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment by virtue of the plaintiff's contributions of time and money, namely (a) an enrichment, (b) a corresponding deprivation, and (c) the absence of any juristic reason for the enrichment.
The proper remedy was an award of monetary damages representing 25% of the increase in the value of the defendant's assets during the relationship, not the imposition of a constructive trust; and (2) jointly held properties were to be sold pursuant to the Partition Act, unless the plaintiff elected to buy out the defendant's one half interest within 30 days.
Prejudgment interest was calculated from the date of separation to September 1, 1991, at 10% per year."

The appellant also asserts that whether or not Mrs. J.L. believed the Nicholsons made the arrangements to have the cottage burned, Mrs. J.L. was in breach of Statutory Condition 6(1)(b)(ii) because she did not provide the appellant insurer with particulars of how the loss occurred insofar as she knew.","The appellant insurer appealed a decision dismissing its claim that the respondent conspired with her sister and brother-in-law to have her cottage intentionally burned.

Dismissing the appeal,
that the respondent did not wilfully make any false statement, and answered all questions as required on the documents provided.
Her silence in the face of uncertainty over her in-laws involvement in the fire did not constitute fraud.

No. 80452 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA TRIAL DIVISION IN THE MATTER OF: An Application for an Order in the nature of Habeas Corpus and for an Order in the nature of Certiorari in aid thereof pursuant to the provisions of the Liberty of the Subject Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, C. Kaulback, Q.C. for the Respondent 1991 S.H. No. 80452 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA TRIAL DIVISION IN THE MATTER OF: An Application for an Order in the nature of Habeas Corpus and for an Order in the nature of Certiorari in aid thereof pursuant to the provisions of the Liberty of the Subject Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, C. (Orally) This is an application for an Order in the nature of Habeas Corpus and an Order in the nature of Certiorari in aid thereof. The applicant, through her counsel, contends that the Provincial Court judge erred in committing the applicant for trial and that her detention is, therefore, unlawful. At the conclusion of the hearing of evidence at the preliminary inquiry the Provincial Court judge, in committing the applicant for trial, stated: ""I find here that there is evidence adduced by the Crown as far as the killing of Mr. Adshade was done by Mark Dickie. It is my opinion that based on all of the evidence before me that the evidence adduced by the Crown here, yesterday and today, that properly instructed jury may find Mrs. Adshade guilty of the offence charged, and I'm satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to commit her for trial on the charge before the Court, namely that on the 29th day of April, 1991, at or near Truro in the County of Colchester, that she did commit first degree murder on the person of Leon Adshade, contrary to Section 235(1) of the Criminal Code, and therefore pursuant to Section 548 of the Criminal Code, hereby commit Mrs. Adshade for trial ..."" Mr. Beveridge submits that there was no evidence before the learned judge upon which to properly base his conclusion. As preliminary argument Mr. Beveridge contends that the scope of review of the committing judge's decision by this court is broader in this type of application, i.e. Habeas Corpus with Certiorari in aid, than in an application for Certiorari relief alone. He concedes, however, that the test to be applied in this application, which may, in his view, be broader than the test applied in an application for ""certiorari"" alone, is the test applied by MacDonald, J.A. in R. (2d) 361 (A.D.) where he states: ""The day has long gone when mere scintilla of evidence will justify committal for trial; thus on an application for criminal habeas corpus with certiorari in aid agree, as stated earlier, with Evans, J.A. in the Botting case, that the reviewing court should examine the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry to determine its sufficiency to deprive the Applicant of his liberty. In so examining the evidence the superior court is not really substituting discretion for that of magistrate but rather is determining whether the magistrate applied proper principles in ordering committal for trial."" For the purposes of this application it is not necessary to decide whether there is such distinction in the tests to be applied as suggested by Mr. Beveridge. In my view, the issue before the court may be resolved by using what Mr. Beveridge suggests may be the broader test as expressed by MacDonald, J.A. Mr. Beveridge submits that the test the committing judge indicated he applied, i.e. that upon the evidence adduced before him ""a properly instructed jury may find Mrs. Adshade guilty of the offence charged"", is not the proper test as verbalized by MacDonald, J.A. in R. In reviewing a decision of the committing judge, with respect to Mr. Beveridge, the question is not whether the judge correctly verbalized the test to be used but rather whether the evidence before the judge supported the conclusion to commit for trial. review of the transcript of the evidence adduced before the learned judge at the preliminary enquiry shows evidence of the following circumstances: (1) Mark Dickie murdered Leon Adshade; (2) At the time, the accused and Mr. Dickie were friends or acquaintances; (3) couple of days before the murder, Mr. Dickie brought and left baseball bat at the accused's apartment; (4) Mr. Dickie brought knife to the accused's apartment; (5) couple of days before Mr. Dickie killed Leon Adshade at the accused's apartment by hitting him on the skull with the baseball bat and stabbing him with the knife at the accused's apartment, he discussed with the accused the idea about hitting Leon Adshade with the baseball bat; (6) That the deceased was the estranged husband of the applicant; (7) Mr. Dickie killed Leon Adshade and placed his body in the accused's bedroom closet when only they were present in the accused's apartment; (8) That Mr. Dickie left the accused's apartment and later that evening or early the following morning returned to the accused's apartment, removed the body and cleaned up the apartment with rag and mop; (9) That the accused went to party that evening returning home at 5:00 a.m. on the following day; (10) That while at the party Mr. Dickie called to speak to the accused and she temporarily left the party; (11) That the day following the murder the accused, in the presence of Mr. Dickie, cleaned the kitchen floor with javex, scrubbed the bench upon which Leon Adshade was seated in the kitchen when he was struck with the baseball bat and stabbed with the knife; (12) The bench was later found to be stained with blood which could have come from the deceased; (13) The day following the murder Mr. Dickie obtained from Block cheque made payable to the accused. Section 231(3) provides: ""Without limiting the generality of subsection (2), murder is planned and deliberate when it is committed pursuant to an arrangement under which money or anything of value passes or is intended to pass from one person to another, or is promised by one person to another, as consideration for that other's causing or assisting in causing the death of anyone or counselling another person to do any act causing or assisting in causing that death."" Section 21(1) provides: 21(1) Every one is party to an offence who (a) actually commits it; (b) does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it; or (c) abets any person in committing it."" Mr. Beveridge submits that: (1) there is no evidence of planning on the part of the applicant either through money arrangement or otherwise, as there must be in order to commit for trial; and (2) there is no evidence that the applicant actually committed the offence charged or aided or abetted Mr. Dickie in committing the offence charged, again as there must be in order to commit for trial. In dealing with the first submission, agree with Mr. Beveridge to the extent that there is no direct evidence of planning on the part of the applicant. finding of planning on the part of the applicant must, therefore, be supported by circumstantial evidence. There is, in my view, evidence of circumstances which could support conclusion of planning, such as previous discussion between Mr. Dickie and the applicant of Mr. Dickie hitting the deceased with baseball bat prior to the killing, bringing and leaving the baseball bat at the applicant's apartment, forcefully striking the deceased over the head with the baseball bat and stabbing the deceased all in the presence of the applicant and the payment of unowed money to Mr. Dickie by the applicant on the following day. Dealing with Mr. Beveridge's second submission, again agree that if, on the evidence, the applicant was simply passive spectator to the crime, there would be no basis for the committal. However, there is again, in my view, evidence which would support conclusion that the applicant aided or abetted Mr. Dickie in committing the offence charged. There is evidence that the applicant, two days before the killing, knew of Mr. Dickie's intention to strike the deceased with the baseball bat, that the baseball bat was brought to her apartment and remained there until used by Mr. Dickie in striking the deceased and that the applicant's estranged husband was killed in her apartment. In my view, there was evidence before the learned judge upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting reasonably in accordance with those instructions, could convict the accused of first degree murder. J. Halifax, Nova Scotia February 5, 1992 1991 S.H. No. 80542 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA TRIAL DIVISION IN THE MATTER OF: An Application for an Order in the nature of Habeas Corpus and for an Order in the nature of Certiorariin aid thereof pursuant to the provisions of the Liberty of the Subject Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, C.","This was an application for an Order in the nature of Habeas Corpus and Certiorari in aid.
The applicant had been charged with the first degree murder of her estranged husband.
The judge at preliminary inquiry concluded that there was evidence adduced that the accused had paid money to the man who had killed the victim the day after the killing, that she was involved in cleaning the apartment where the killing took place after the body was removed, and that the accused and the man who killed the victim had discussed the matter prior to the event, and thus there was sufficient evidence upon which a 'properly instructed jury may find...[the accused] guilty...'
The appellant contended that the judge had applied the wrong test for committal.
Dismissing the application,
that the question is not whether the judge correctly verbalized the test, but rather if the evidence supported the committal, and there was, indeed, enough circumstantial evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting reasonably in accordance with those instructions, could convict the accused of first degree murder."
697,"The reasons for judgment of the court were delivered orally by: JONES, J.A.: This is an appeal from a decision of the Nova Scotia Municipal Board directing the City of Halifax to amend zoning map ZM‑17 for the purpose of increasing the height precinct on the property at 5222‑30 Tobin Street, Halifax to 75 feet. As required by Section 70(6) of the Planning Act, the Board hereby determines that the decision of Council cannot reasonably be said to carry out the intent of the M.P.S. and allows the appeal."" The city has appealed from that decision.","This was an appeal of a Municipal Board decision which overturned city council's refusal to allow the respondent's application to vary the height restriction on a proposed project.
The proposal met all requirements of the Municipal Planning Strategy.
Dismissing the appeal,
that the Board did not exceed its jurisdiction in reviewing council's decision."
698,"In 1993, the appellant made application for variation of this order pursuant to Section 37, which reads; ""Where an order for the payment of maintenance or expenses or respecting care and custody or access and visiting privileges has been made pursuant to this Act, an applicant or respondent may apply to the court to have the order varied, rescinded or suspended, and judge may vary, rescind or suspend the order on the basis that the circumstances have changed."" Judge Levy held a pre‑trial conference, at which time the respondent raised a jurisdictional question, arguing that the payment of the lump sum in 1985 fully and finally discharged his responsibility for child support.","This was an appeal of a decision which denied variation of a maintenance award where a lump sum had been previously ordered.
The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application.
Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court,
that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation.
The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances.
Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act."
699,"Although did not have clear evidence on the income level where the Child Tax Credit is not available, it does appear that Ms. Mosher will not be entitled to it if she receives support award in the range she claims is needed by herself and her children.","The parties lived together for 14 years and had three children, aged eight, 13 and 14.
The petitioner always worked and eventually became a successful stockbroker.
The respondent was employed part-time doing minimum wage jobs and was responsible for the household duties and raising their children.
The petitioner's annual income was $50,000 at the time of separation, but escalated to $200,000 in 1992 and was prone to great fluctuation.
The respondent was to have custody of the children.
She sought spousal and child support and an unequal division of assets.
Ordering support and an unequal division of assets.
The court extensively reviewed the case of Moge v. Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L.(3d) 345 (S.C.C.) and found that marriage and child care responsibilities hinder a wife's role in the workplace.
The court awarded $4500 per month as spousal and child support, plus an additional $500 while the wife retrained.
The court considered this an appropriate case for an unequal division of matrimonial assets in the respondent's favour.
Finding that the awards were still not sufficient to satisfy the respondent's needs, a lump sum award of $18,000 was ordered.
On appeal."
700,"The Issue On the basis of the facts adduced by affidavit on behalf of the applicants, the issue is stated as follows: Does the extensive involvement of Mr. Pink with the law firm of Patterson Kitz, the firm which acted as general counsel to (Amherst Aerospace Inc.) at all material times, and the fact that most of the lawyers at Pink Breen were formerly at Patterson Kitz, result in conflict of interest making Mr. Pink and the firm of Pink Breen ineligible to continue representing the plaintiffs in the action against the applicants and others?","The solicitor for the plaintiff union had been a partner of the law firm which incorporated the defendant company and was under a general retainer to them.
Several of the defendants made application to have the plaintiff s solicitor removed as solicitor of record claiming this was a conflict of interest.
Dismissing the application,
that the test in such circumstances is whether the public represented by the reasonably informed person would be satisfied that no use of confidential information would occur.
To do so it must be shown that a solicitor client relationship existed.
There must not be a danger of the confidential information coming back to haunt the client.
The court found that such a relationship did not exist in this instance.
In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that the solicitor received information which is relevant to the matter at hand.
The court found no such evidence of this possibility.
It is no bar to representation by a solicitor that some former partners at a previous firm will be examined for discovery or called to testify."

He contended the trial judge erred by permitting the complainant to testify behind a screen without first conducting a voir dire and by relying on Crown's submission the girl would be uncomfortable without the screen.

Dismissing the appeal,
that the fairness of the trial was in no way impaired by use of the screen, and no miscarriage of justice occurred.

He accidentally injected one of his fingers with paint.
The finger had to be amputated.
He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer.
HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.
 1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type.
It operated at 2,500 lbs. pressure.
This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user.
The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn.
2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor.
Where an enterprise or activity is inherently dangerous, the duty to warn can not be delegated.
In such a situation the party who retains the independent contractor remains vicariously liable.
3)The waiver in the rental contract was ineffective.
It was a standard form agreement signed on its face with the terms of the contract on the reverse.
4)The Plaintiff was awarded general damages of $10,000.00, $5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and recovered $3,789.50 for SHSP.
5)The usual increase in general damages for inflation and pre-judgment interest were both reduced because the Plaintiff had not presecuted his action expeditiously."

The applicant, which leased six school buildings from the Roman Catholic Church, submitted the respondent was required to reimburse the applicant for leasing costs.
For the respondent,
that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval.
Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs.

The Father now intended, however, to move with the children to Ontario to take additional education.
HELD: Application dismissed.
1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed.
She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children.

The defendant refused to honour the policy.
It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy.

This application pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, is for an order setting aside the default judgment entered against the Town of Mahone Bay on February 7, 1996. Since found the default judgment should be set aside based on Civil procedure Rule 3.04, and that there is fairly arguable defence and reasonable excuse for not filing the defence, it is unnecessary to decide whether or not exemplary damages (or solicitor client costs) fall under unliquidated damages.","This was an application by the defendants to set aside a default judgment entered against them by the plaintiff.
Although a statement of claim was served on the defendant, it's insurer was advised by the plaintiff's counsel that she would not proceed to judgment except on 10 days written notice.
More than six months later plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to the defendant's insurer giving 10 days notice.
This letter was not seen by him although he was in the process of putting together material for a solicitor to file a defence.
The defendant had always advised the plaintiff that it intended to defend.
No Notice of Intention, required for default judgment if six or more months had elapsed since the last step in the proceeding, was ever given to the defendant before the filing of the default judgment.
Allowing the application and setting aside the default judgment,
that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse on the part of the defendant for not filing the defence.
Sending a letter to the insurer does not satisfy the requirement of filing a Notice of Intention to proceed.

Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value.
It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time it was made.
Taking into account the factors before the sentencing judge, the sentence imposed could not be found to be clearly unreasonable."
714,The Applicant may also have source of income as musician.,"On the confirmation hearing the Respondent testified that the Applicant was receiving unemployment insurance when the judgment for divorce and corollary relief were granted.
Subsequent to the provisional order there was evidence that the applicant had received a promotion and may also have income as a musician.
HELD: The confirmation hearing was adjourned and the matter was remitted back for further information.
The court was not satisfied that it had accurate information as to the applicant's present income so as to warrant variation."
715,"Then to circumvent the fact that there are no other assets for lump-sum pay out and to avoid the effect of Scott being an undischarged bankrupt, Karen wants monthly sum paid to her disguised as spousal support but which is in effect, the balance of the value of Scott's pension adjudged owing to her. If Karen fails to provide the written notice in the time provided, then there will be an order that when the monthly pension benefit commences to be paid to Scott, the plan administrator shall pay to Karen portion of the monthly pension benefit calculated as follows: years of marriage monthly pension benefit 1/2 years of service Karen's monthly entitlement This leaves the issue of child support.","Issues included the division of a pension, child and spousal support and whether to transfer or have sold the matrimonial home which had a small equity.
The petitioner was an undischarged bankrupt and any funds in his possession belonged to the trustee.
The only marital asset of any value was the petitioner's pension but lump sum payment was not available for five years as there was a liquidity problem.
The parties had been 'spenders' not 'savers'.
HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support for one child.
2)Spousal support was denied.
3)The matrimonial home was to be sold and proceeds were to be divided equally.
 4)Three values were suggested for valuation and distribution of the pension plan.
The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method.
The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP.
The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP.
The respondent was to make the choice between the only two options.
If she wished to have the funds in her name immediately, she was to provide written notification otherwise there would be an order that the respondent is to receive a portion when the monthly pension benefit commences."
716,"July 2, 1996 This is an application by the respondent, Wayne Andrew Morsky, to disqualify and to remove the law firm of Robertson Stromberg from acting for the petitioner, Sandra Anne Morsky in this action.","FIAT. An application to disqualify and remove a solicitor and law firm from acting for the petitioner.
Steps were not taken to ensure that no disclosure of information would occur for a month after the firm was put on notice.
At issue was whether the screening measures taken ensured that no disclosure would occur and satisfied the evidentiary burden imposed on the law firm.
HELD: The solicitor and the law firm were disqualified from acting for the petitioner in the action.
Because two years had lapsed further examinations were appropriate and an order issued for the petitioner to attend a further examination.
If the updated information is not necessary for trial the petitioner may request costs at that time.
The application for an order with respect to without prejudice offers of settlement was dismissed as matters of evidence were to be determined by the trial judge.
 1)Since the decision in Martin v. Gray the Law Society amended the code of conduct to provide for rules where a member transfers from one law firm to another.
2)The difficulty in this case was that no measures were taken prior to or at the time the solicitor joined the firm to ensure confidentiality.
The time period before taking appropriate steps was completely inadequate.
 3)The second question, whether there was a risk that the confidential information will be used to the prejudice of the client, Martin v. Gray stated that once the presumption arises and is not rebutted, the lawyer's disqualification is automatic and no assurances or undertakings not to use the information will avail. 4)The respondent was awarded the costs of the motion fixed at $300."
717,"The grounds upon which this appeal is brought are: 1.The decision is against the law, the evidence and the weight of evidence; 2.The Discipline Committee erred in finding that the conduct of the Appellant constituted professional misconduct; 3.The Discipline Committee erred in finding that the Appellant intentionally misrepresented to Dale Bonner the contents of the SPDU report; 4.The Discipline Committee erred in its determination that the Appellant threatened Paul Bedier when he requested transfer and resignation from the principalship; 5.The Discipline Committee erred in its determination that the identified acts of the Appellant, in isolation, constituted coercion and thereby constituted professional misconduct; 6.The Discipline Committee made overriding and palpable errors in its findings of fact and (sic) application of those facts and otherwise erred in its application of the burden and standard of proof; 7.In the alternative, that the disposition imposed by the Respondent Executive Committee was excessive.","A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division.
The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'.
The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500.
At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
 1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach.
The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law.
None were found in either case.
The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.
 2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format.
The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case.
3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified.
Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct.
The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee.
They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act.
If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case.
In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220.
The concluding paragraph was amended to read: Subject to what has been stated in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the respondent will be entitled to recover its costs of, and incidental to this appeal, from the appellant, to be taxed on Column 3."

The respondent had served notice to lapse all of the caveats which were based on an agreement taken by Freeholders Oil from the registered owner of the minerals.
The respondent sought an order directing the caveats be continued on the condition Home Oil commence an action within a reasonable time to determine their validity.
At issue was whether the caveator or the challenger should be required to initiate an action.
HELD: The caveats were to be continued until a further court order was filed in the Land Titles Office or until they were withdrawn.
1) Each of the agreements was prima facie still in existence as there had been no cancellation or rescission of the agreements and Home Oil was the valid successor of the interest of Freeholders.
2) Further documentation would be required by a trial judge to determine the issue of the validity of Home Oil's interest in the leases including whether Home Oil's lease violated the rule against perpetuities.
 3) Home Oil was given its costs of the application."

The mother sought to have the ongoing child support of $180 per month per child for the three children of the marriage increased.
The last three income tax returns of the father indicated an average gross income of $28,000 after adjustments.

He purchased stock totalling $202,061 in 1996 using income generated from the farm.
He claimed he could not work full time in the oil field because he was involved in a bison operation.
HELD: The respondent was to pay monthly child support of $957 for as long as the children remained children as defined by the Divorce Act.
It was appropriate to impute income of $56,000 as the respondent's assets were not being reasonably utilized to generate income."
720,"18(1) of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act. Section 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 states as follows: 63(2) On application by debtor, creditor of debtor, secured party, sheriff or person with an interest in the collateral, the court may make one or more of the following orders: (a) an order, including binding declaration of right and an order for injunctive relief, that is necessary to ensure compliance with this Part or section 17, 36, 37 or 38; (b) an order giving directions to any person regarding the exercise of rights or the discharge of obligations pursuant to this Part or section 17, 36, 37 or 38; (c) an order relieving person from compliance with the requirements of this Part or section 17, 36, 37 or 38; (d) an order staying enforcement of rights provided in this Part or section 17, 36, 37 or 38 or (e) any order that is necessary to ensure protection of the interest of any person in the collateral.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s63 of the Personal Property Security Act (PPSA) declaring that the agreement between the parties was a security agreement within the definition of the Personal Property Security Act rather than a lease and that the respondent was limited to a lien pursuant to s18 of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act; and an order that funds paid into court pursuant to a pre-judgment garnishee summons be returned to the applicant.
The respondent seized the vehicle and issued a statement of claim for $5,330.81 as arrears of lease payments.
The applicant had made payments for several months and acknowledged that she was in default on the payments for the tractor-trailer unit but contended the agreement was not a lease and that the respondent, having repossessed the collateral, was not now entitled to claim any additional payments.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
Costs in the cause.
1)The relief sought did not fall within any of the wording of s63(2) of the Personal Property Security Act and therefore there was no jurisdiction to grant the relief requested.
The application was simply an attempt to end run the action commenced by the respondent.
2)The applicant was not seeking to remedy a wrong with respect to the seizure or preservation of the collateral but was seeking a remedy pursuant to the Limitations of Civil Rights Act.
The proper forum was to have the issues determined in the action commenced by the respondent."

The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months.
During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff.
The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended.
She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause.
She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible.
The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice.
Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice,
that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice.
This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause."

At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.
 1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question.
The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable.
2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.
 3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB.
The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters."
724,"[26] In the light of all this, including the ambiguity associated with the use of the word give instead of the term serve, coupled with the indications of the purpose of the subsection and its objectives, one might reasonably interpret the statutory terms governing the exercise of the right of appeal as calling for no more, necessarily, than the posting of the requisite notice by registered mail before the expiration of the 20 day period.","At issue was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly having regard for s303(1) of the Rural Municipality Act and how and when notice was given.
The company posted the notice of appeal by registered mail the day before the expiration of the 20 day appeal period.
The notice arrived at the post office on a Friday, the day after the period expired and was picked up by the administrator the following Monday.
The Appeals Committee refused to direct the board of revision to hear the appeal on the basis the company failed to give notice within the period prescribed by s303(1) and concluded that the board did not have the power to extend the time.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The board of revision was directed to hear and determine the assessment appeal.
1)The Committee did not err in deciding the prescribed time period for an appeal could not be extended.
 2)The less formal expression 'to give notice to' as used in the Act is a less exacting term than 'to serve notice upon'.
Wascana Energy exercised its right of appeal properly, or at least effectively, requiring the board of revision to entertain the appeal."
725,"[18] return briefly to the issue of the rationality of choosing the phrase ""pursuant to"" to mean ""subject to"" even though it is reasonable to choose ""for the purposes of."" [19] consideration of the issue immediately raises these questions: Is it ""clearly irrational"" (to use Cory J's phrase) for the parties to collective agreement to provide right to severance allowance to every employee whose position is eliminated as result of technological change through reorganization or otherwise (Article 16) and then to limit that right by giving the employer the right to provide the employee with alternative employment and failing that by giving the employee an option to exercise his right to severance allowance or be laid-off subject to recall (Article 28)?","The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions.
She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable.
Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear.
2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'.
Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review.
DISSENT:
The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky.
The Chambers judge did not follow that approach.
Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears.
The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear.
The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation.
Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges."

The mother was on leave from her employment.
When his federal government management position was declared redundant, the applicant received a retiring allowance of $75,646 in May 1997.
The respondent opposed the application on the basis there had been no change in circumstances since the judgment was granted; she had no other income than the support payments and child tax credit; alternatively, there were special provisions in the parties' separation agreement which would permit the court to award an amount that differs from the amount prescribed by the Guidelines.HELD: 1)The judgment the applicant sought to vary was made after the coming into force of the Guidelines.
It did not however include a determination of child support made in accordance with the Guidelines.
There was no change in the childrens' or mother's circumstances.
The applicant was unemployed but was still benefiting from his retiring allowance at the time of the order which he no longer enjoyed.
A variation was warranted as there had been a change in the father's financial means and circumstances.
The Guideline support obligation for two children is $341 per month.
 2)It could not be concluded on the evidence presented that there was any special provision in the parties' agreement that directly or indirectly benefited either child.
The provision for child support in a specified amount greater than that provided in the Guidelines was not a 'special provision' as contemplated by s17(6.2) of the Divorce Act given the change in circumstances of the applicant whose annual income had dropped from $55,500 to $24,000 a year.

An application to vary maintenance for two children under the Federal Child Supprt Guidelines.
At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d).
The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields.
He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October.
He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work.
The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated.
HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month.
1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income.
The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997.
Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past.
No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years.
The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded.
In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable.
The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck.
The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children.
His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine.
2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute.
Leave was given to return the matter to the Court with the appropriate supporting materials.
 3)No order as to costs."
728,"held that when the husband applied to vary the order that the application must be dismissed because as he said, quoting from the decision in Gessner, supra, at page 302: ""Furthermore, the agreement was worded in such manner that it is obvious it was intended by the parties to be final settlement of their obligations to each other.","FIAT. The parties were married in 1973 and separated in 1992.

The wife counter-petitioned in 1993 claiming a 'lump sum and periodic spousal support'.

Both acknowledged that they were aware of the nature and effect of the agreement and each had independent legal advice before signing.
The husband paid periodic spousal support until December 1995.
The applicant sought to vary the 1993 order on the grounds there had been a change in circumstances in that her annual income was currently less than half of what it had been at the time the order was made and her economic hardship could be traced to the breakdown of her marriage primarily because his job had required them to move from place to place during the marriage.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
1)The agreement was intended to be final.
While the applicant's income had dropped she had not established that she could not be self-sufficient.
The terms of the agreement which limited the payment of spousal support to December 1995 appeared to be applicable.
The applicant had previously brought a similar variation application even though she earned in excess of $25,000 in 1995.

The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation.
The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants.
HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions.
The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed.
1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation.
Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution.
The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs.
2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance.
A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances.
To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal.

The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence.
The defendants, carrying on business as a hauling sub-contractor to Tri-Link, reported a cheque drawn on the plaintiff bank as lost.
Tri-Link issued a replacement cheque.
The first cheque was certified at a bank branch of the plaintiff in Alberta and deposited to the defendants' credit union account.
Default judgments were obtained in January/March 1997 against the defendants who now sought to have them set aside pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 346 and 173(a).
The defendants claimed the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action as a certified cheque is irrevocable and as such any default judgment may be set aside ex debito justitiae, in which case delay in bringing the application is not factor.
The plaintiff claims it has a cause of action in either conversion or mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.
HELD: The defendants' motion was dismissed as the plaintiff's statement of claim adequately disclosed a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.
 1)There are exceptions to the irrevocable nature of a certified cheque.
The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of a certified cheque as payment did not satisfy a just debt.
The defendants in this instance had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants.
The cerified cheque did not satisfy a just debt.
The defendants had already received payment for their services.
 2)In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of the payee is maintained while providing recourse to a bank where a payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a certified cheque."

An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act.
The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability.
The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher.
HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act.
2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver.
The reasoning in Neault was directly on point.
Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act.
3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes.
When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act.
The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers.
The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute.
4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer.
The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals."
732,"Ford for the Respondent APPEAL HEARD: February 12, 1999 CORAM: The Honourable Chief Justice Bayda The Honourable Mr. Justice Tallis The Honourable Mr. Justice Sherstobitoff THE COURT [1] In this action brought by the respondent/plaintiff on a hail insurance contract for the 1996 crop year, the appellant, McQueen Agencies Ltd., appeals from an order entered in Queen’s Bench on October 15, 1998.","The insurer appealed the October 1998 order which dismissed the appellant's motion for dismissal of the insured's action and for summary judgment on its counterclaim for insurance premiums payable under the hail insurance contract.
The insured had signed a promissory note and tendered a cheque payable in September 1996 but stopped payment and advanced a claim of set-off.
HELD: The appeal was allowed in part under Rule 129 without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to proceed for the alleged loss of $38,585.
1)The appellant was granted leave to amend its statement of defence by pleading the relevant statutory conditions in the Saskatchewan Insurance Act and any additional material facts and new matters raised by the amended statement of claim.
The plaintiff was granted leave to reply.
Each party was permitted to re-open the examinations for discovery.
2)The insured had no defence to the counterclaim for premiums which was a separate action.
The prayer for relief was amended to claim the full amount of the premiums which were payable with interest at the rate of 10% as stipulated in the promissory note together with costs on the applicable tariff in Queen's Bench and in the Court of Appeal on single column 5."
733,"While Hunter Miller`s concerns are legitimate and should be taken seriously, on behalf of their clients, on balance, I find no real risk to Mr. Magnes nor Mrs. D.A.L.(F.) that either would be prejudiced if Mr. Zinkhan, Ms. Quaroni and Ms. Krueger of the Olive Waller firm, continue to act, so long as the screen is in place and is adhered to.","In issue was whether the law firm was in a conflict of interest with respect to two matrimonial files and whether the firm could remain as counsel for the spouses.
HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux.
The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm.
At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes.
She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses.
2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case.
There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act.
A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur.
There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening.
Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her.
The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet.
The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter.
The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs."
734,"[13] Concluding that both parents were involved in “protracted pattern of dysfunctional, conflictual communication” and having regard in particular to the age and unwavering antagonism of the two eldest children, Mr. Prediger recommended that custody of [T.B.D.] remain with the mother, the parents have joint custody of [M.M.D.] whose primary residence would be with the father, and custody of [L.C.D.] remain with the mother. The next day [T.B.D.] calls his father pleading with him to have [M.M.D.] and [L.C.D.] ready to return to their mother’s house and not to make scene.","Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute.
The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997.
The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100.
He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home.
He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share.
The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence.
He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home.
HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother.
The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend.
2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited.
The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed.
The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent.
The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.'
The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate.
The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report.
3)The property was to be sold.
The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home.
A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour.
Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds.
4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father.
RRSP's were to be divided equally.
Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party.
Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father.
The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred.
No repayments had been made in 10 years.
The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility.
5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect.
The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory.
Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income.
No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof.
The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced.
6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days."
735,Mr. Justice Matheson of this Court granted the application on the basis the competency examination had been obtained by the subterfuge (initiated by persons other than Dr. Keegan) of asking Mr. Brady to attend medical examination in connection with pension application he had made some time earlier and then administering to him mental competency examination; and also on the basis there was no record of the review panel hearing and no reasons given by the review panel for its decision to uphold the certificate.,"FIAT. A defendant applied for an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court, alternatively s.50 of the Queen's Bench Act, for an order requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days; requiring a report to be filed with the court as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct his solicitor; and staying proceedings until a report is filed.
The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate.
The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
 1)Our civil procedure does not contemplate the trial of an issue on a person's competence to bring a lawsuit.
A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act had the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding legal proceedings and would result in the appointment of a litigation guardian.
This step was not deemed necessary based on the evidence presented.
A stay was refused.
 2)Costs incurred in defending a civil action against a person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are recoverable from the estate.
3)Queen's Bench Act s.50 did not apply.
 4)The plaintiff was entitled to his costs in any event of the cause."
736,"I order access to the respondent for that purpose, provided, on such occasion, the respondent will pick up and return the children to the applicant's residence in Medicine Hat.","The applicant asserted the third party (the respondent's father's company) paid $55,000 to the respondent's company in contravention of the June 7, 1999 order which directed any funds accruing to the company be paid into court and froze any money to be paid out.
The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial.
The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access.
The applicant had been prohibited in a 1998 order from removing the children from Saskatchewan without a court order, absent consent.HELD: 1)The issue of the payments was directed to trial and pre-trial conference to be held in January.
2)The mother was granted leave to move the children to Alberta.
Their primary residence was to continue to be with her.
She was encouraged to attain self-sufficiency.
Access was to be maintained and the mother was ordered to return the children to Saskatchewan for purposes of allowing the respondent to exercise access in accordance with existing orders.
Additional access was granted provided he picked up and returned the children to the applicant's residence.
3)The 1998 interim order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home was not changed.
The applicant was at liberty to rent the home.
4)The applicant was directed to take all reasonable steps to sell the recreational trailer in her possession and to pay the sale proceeds to the bank to discharge the lien and the balance into court.
She was to file an affidavit of bona fides as to the sale which should relieve her of the obligation for payment of the loan.
 5)Costs were reserved to the trial."
737,"The applicant/plaintiff, Daniel Tapp, shall therefore have payment out to him of all moneys paid into court by Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation with respect to Q.B.G. 639 of 1999, and Q.B.G. 929 of 1999, together with accrued interest less that amount which was previously ordered paid out as costs to SPMC by Justice Wright in the amount of $324.33.","The plaintiff lawyer commenced an action for fees and disbursements in the amount of $4,647.85.
The proposed garnishee, SPMC, paid $337.46 into court and brought an application for an order pursuant to Rules 411 and 415(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court.
An order that any further amounts due and owing from SPMC to the company be paid into court to be disposed as directed by the court was granted with taxed costs to SPMC.
Labour Standards filed notice of potential wage claims.
The plaintiff obtained default judgment and made an ex parte application for payment out of the monies paid into court by SPMC.
HELD: The applicant/plaintiff was to be paid all monies paid into court by SPMC with respect to the two files together with accrued interest less the amount previously paid out.
The claim by the Minister of Labour was dismissed.
Although the monies paid into court according to the decision in Polyco Window Manufacturing Ltd v. Prudential Assurance Co create a fund from which creditors must be paid, the claim by the Minister of Labour as of the date of the application was not a proven claim.
No certificate had been issued and no judgment had been entered as of that date.
A judgment had been filed by the plaintiff.
He was the only party entitled to the monies."
738,"For 77-year-old woman to be uncertain as to what to do, and to want her sons to deal with the police on difficult family matter makes eminent sense; c) if Calvin Klimek was coming to the farm to do as he said he would do, she would be safer away from the farm; d) Mrs. Klimek and Michael both took the words of the Accused seriously there was no delay in calling the police and giving statements.","The accused was charged with uttering threats to his 77 year old mother to cause death to her and his brothers contrary to s.264.1 of the Criminal Code.
HELD: The accused was found guilty.
1)The words spoken by the accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously and implied menace to the listeners.
The accused's evidence was disbelieved.
His constructed story did not 'hang together'.
 2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value.
The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences.
Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility.
The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference."
739,[8] Mr. Shrubsall submits that the summary conviction appeal court judge erred by adopting errors of law made at trial and by failing to properly apply his appellate powers pursuant to s.686(1)(a) of the Code: 686.,"The appellant appealed from his conviction on a charge of criminal harassment.
He alleged that the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.
In addition, he claimed that the trial judge had erred in admitting as evidence an audiotape of a confrontation between the complainant and the appellant.
The Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge dismissed the appeal.
The appellant appealed.
Dismissing the appeal,
that the Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge did not err in the test which he applied in reviewing the trial decision, nor did he err in accepting the trial judge's decision to admit into evidence the audiotape."
740,"Dated: 20000403 2000 SKCA 39 Docket: 2096 THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN Coram: Tallis, Vancise Lane JJ.A. DONALD BROWN AND EDNA BROWN and THE WAWANESA MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY COUNSEL: Mr. Bill Selnes for the Appellants Mr. Greg Thompson for the Respondent DISPOSITION: On Appeal From: Q.B. 787/94, J.C. of Prince Albert Application Heard: 03 April 2000 Application Allowed: 03 April 2000 (Orally) Written Reasons: 05 April 2000 Reasons By: The Honourable Mr. Justice Tallis In Concurrence: The Honourable Mr. Justice Vancise The Honourable Mr. Justice Lane TALLIS J.A.","The appellants sought to admit fresh evidence.
HELD: 1)A new trial was ordered.
The due diligence requirement was relaxed in light of the allegation of arson in the respondent's statement of defence.
Although the expert evidence was available at trial, counsel failed to competently present the evidence.
The fresh evidence could reasonably have affected the trial result respecting the cause of the fire.
 2)The appellants were to pay party and party costs plus the respondent's cost of all proceedings in the Court of Appeal including preparation for the appeal taxed on double column V on or before July 15, 2000.
In default of payment the appellant's claim may be struck."
741,The applicant also asserts that the respondent is now employed part-time and earns an income which was not the case at the time the agreement was entered into.,"FIAT. The husband seeks to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' 1975 separation agreement.
This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first.
The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years.
The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income.
In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement.
At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant.
HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent.
The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established.
Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement.
It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income.
This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support.
The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement.
The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent.
The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support."
742,"Counsel for the Respondent asks the Court in considering the best interest of the child to take into account, “That the Inuit culture is not that of the Nova Scotia, white community and that the standards used to judge the care, likewise should not be based on the standards of the Nova Scotia white community, but include the standard and accepted lifestyle of the Inuit brought out through the evidence on behalf of the Respondent.” With this, the Court agrees. Considering all the evidence before the Court, it is in the best interests of the child David, that custody be granted to the Applicant, his father.","This was a hearing to determine the proper venue for a custody hearing.
The parties resided together in 1991 and 1992 in the Territory of Nunavut.
The first language of the respondent mother and the child is Inuktitut.
The child, born in 1993, lived with the mother in Nunavut until 1999, when he moved to Nova Scotia to be with the father by agreement of both parties.
This arrangement was not to exceed one year unless agreed to by the mother.
Determining that the courts in both Nunavut and Nova Scotia have jurisdiction to deal with the issue of custody, that it was in the best interests of the child to remain in Nova Scotia and for the custody hearing to be held in Nova Scotia."
743,"Nature of the Objections [8] The objections taken by the plaintiffs to the questions can be broadly categorized as follows: The question seeks to elicit the plaintiffs' manner of investigation or expert opinions; The question was or ought to have been asked by counsel of another witness more properly suited to answer the question; Questions are best asked of others, notably third parties to the action as they relate to issues between the defendants and the third parties; The question is irrelevant or improper. 467, Line 19 [39] The question asked was: ""Was there any particular pattern on this piece of wood that would indicate contact by propane flame?"" agree with counsel for the plaintiffs that the answer to that question requires an expert opinion which the witness is not required to provide.","The defendants brought an application to compel responses to a large number of questions objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officer for SPMC, and sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings.
The objections were categorized as the questions sought to elicit the plaintiff's manner of investigation or expert opinions; it should have been asked of another witness better suited to answer or third parties as the questions relate to issues between the defendant and the third parties; it was irrelevant or improper.
HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action.
2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire.
3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage.
4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged.
The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal.
5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation.
Questions can be asked of the city.
6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege.
7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague.
The plaintiff's claim was in excess of $7 million.
A proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions and answers given or not given (Hill v. Arcola School Division).
The defendants are not entitled to expert opinion.
8)Whether SPMC's insurer's investigation team participated related to manner of investigation and was therefore privileged.
9)The defendant will be able to examine the city in the third party claim with respect to documents from the fire department.
10)All discussions at mediation proceedings are strictly confidential.
The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged.
11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.
 12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position.
They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date.
Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it.
There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question.
The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement.
19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.
 20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them.
21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed.
It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer.
The same question can be put if the first did not answer it.
The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each.
The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings.
Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was.
Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings.
As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings.
It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with.
There were no exceptional circumstances.
 24)Costs were left to the trial judge."
744,"to obtain disclosure of certain of the advice and opinions of the defendant's solicitor to solicit the opinions of the parties being examined on some of the provisions of an agreement, the construction of which is in issue in these proceedings, and to obtain the legal opinions of the parties being examined as to other disputes between various of the parties to this litigation."" Justice Gibbs described the position of the plaintiff (at p.170) as follows: The plaintiff contends that, having put their state of mind in issue by pleading that they relied upon the plaintiff's conduct to their detriment, the defendants cannot now raise the barrier of solicitor-client privilege to prevent the plaintiff from showing that the defendants had advice and opinions which effectively negate the allegation of reliance upon the plaintiff's conduct.","The borrower in a mortgage foreclosure action counterclaimed against the lender and joined the insurer of the mortgage and experts he had retained for advice in the development on the basis of negligent misrepresentation.
During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate.
No privilege was claimed during the discovery process.
The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs.
Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced.
The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant.
The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver.
There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance."
745,"In this case, all of the members of the Court read your notice of appeal, the relevant portions of the transcript of the trial proceedings, and the Crown factum prior to hearing your arguments today.","Appeals of sentence and conviction on the grounds the transcripts of court proceedings were not available; the court would not subpoena certain witnesses on his behalf; his state of mind when he made the telephone calls exonerated him.
HELD: The appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed.
The judge made no error in ruling that all of the evidence from the prospective witnesses and transcripts was irrelevant as being unrelated to the charges and too remote in time.
The appellant's state of mind was adequately established by his own evidence and the summation to the jury.
The defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it.
The sentence appeal was moot since it was limited to time served while awaiting trial.
The Court would have found the sentence to be fit in any event."
746,"Hirschfeld for the Respondents No one appeared for the Interested Party DISPOSITION: On Appeal From: Q.B.G. No. 2120 of 2001, J.C. Saskatoon Appeal Heard: May 15, 2002 Appeal Dismissed: June 5, 2002 Written Reasons: June 5, 2002 Reasons By: The Honourable Mr. Justice Lane In Concurrence: The Honourable Mr. Justice Cameron The Honourable Mr. Justice Sherstobitoff [1] The appellant was unsuccessful in his application before Queen’s Bench judge in chambers both to have his suspension and probation as medical resident rescinded, and to prohibit the Investigation Committee established to look into the matter from taking further action. The Chambers judge refused to grant the relief requested, finding the issues to be academic in nature and thus within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University, but did rule the appellant’s supervisor should be removed from the committee because of an apprehension of bias.","The appellant was unsuccessful in Queen's Bench in having his suspension and probation as a medical resident rescinded or to prohibit the Investigation Committee, which met on approximately seven occasions and interviewed seven witnesses, from taking further action.
The Chambers judge refused to grant relief, finding the issues to be academic in nature and within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University, but ruled his supervisor should be removed from the Committee because of an apprehension of bias.
The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed.
The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure.
He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V.
1)The material did not meet the test for the admission of fresh evidence.
It simply restated what was at issue and found to have had no effect.
2)There was no tenable basis for interfering.
The remedies are discretionary.
3)The Court was not prepared to grant the relief in any event, given the long delay in seeking recourse.
The initial concern was bias and jurisdiction.
The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below.
4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations.
Proceedings should not be allowed to be fragmented and should be allowed to run their course so the court has a complete record from the tribunals below.
Certiorari should not be granted where there is a right of appeal, except in exceptional circumstances."
747,"It is here that there is serious dispute in respect to what pieces of machinery constitute family property; what exemptions are available to the respondent; and what value should be attributed to the equipment which is subject to distribution. Accordingly, reject the contrary assertions of the respondent and hold that the following pieces of machinery were family property at the relevant date and find the values to be as indicated.","The wife sought distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act.
HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property.
The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced.
The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage.
It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor.
Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools.
While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck.
The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery.
There were no records of the value of the pigs.
Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals.
The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261.
The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt.
The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected.
Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred.
The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm.
The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt."
748,"Counsel for the plaintiff counters that more was obtained than set out in the offer to settle; extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports and that the costs were proportionate to the claim advanced. [22] The plaintiff also claims costs for four pre-trial conferences, an unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses, and transcripts of the medical evidence obtained prior to final argument.","FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store.
The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43.
The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused.
The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to.
The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports.
At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed.
HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success.
Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs.
Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party.
2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages.
3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value.
Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case.
Expenses of each was examined separately.
In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant.
4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee.
A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel.
The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case.
Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court.
It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant.
Costs payable by the plaintiff on an interlocutory application may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs."
749,"The Board ruled on that point favouring the union and making the wage increases fully retroactive as regards the employees in service at the time of the Board order, and also in respect of those who had left the employ of the employer during the two year term of the contract prior to the Board's order.","A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees.
The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract.
HELD: The motion was dismissed.
 1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go.
The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold.
To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive.
2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review.
However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board.
The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply.
The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory.
The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses.
3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)).
4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice.
Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties.
To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference.
Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless."
750,"(4) For the purpose of determining an application under subsection (1), the youth justice court shall take into consideration any factor that is relevant to the case of the young person, including (a) evidence of pattern of persistent violent behaviour and, in particular, (i) the number of offences committed by the young person that caused physical or psychological harm to any other person, (ii) the young person's difficulties in controlling violent impulses to the point of endangering the safety of any other person, (iii) the use of weapons in the commission of any offence, (iv) explicit threats of violence, (v) behaviour of brutal nature associated with the commission of any offence, and (vi) substantial degree of indifference on the part of the young person as to the reasonably foreseeable consequences, to other persons, of the young person's behaviour; (b) psychiatric or psychological evidence that physical or mental illness or disorder of the young person is of such nature that the young person is likely to commit, before the expiry of the youth sentence the young person is then serving, serious violent offence; (c) reliable information that satisfies the youth justice court that the young person is planning to commit, before the expiry of the youth sentence the young person is then serving, serious violent offence; (d) the availability of supervision programs in the community that would offer adequate protection to the public from the risk that the young person might otherwise present until the expiry of the youth sentence the young person is then serving; (e) whether the young person is more likely to reoffend if he or she serves his or her youth sentence entirely in custody without the benefits of serving portion of the youth sentence in the community under supervision; and (f) evidence of pattern of committing violent offences while he or she was serving portion of youth sentence in the community under supervision.","The Provincial Director applied pursuant to s. 98 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act for continuance of the custody portion of a custody and supervision sentence made pursuant to s. 42(2)(n).
The Provincial Director was concerned that, because S.T.T. had not followed through with his treatment, he was at a high risk to offend again.
HELD: The application lacked compelling reasons to keep the young person in custody.
 1) This was the first experience with an application of this nature in Saskatoon and the Court provided a detailed discussion of the procedure for the benefit of future applications.
2) The application was not brought in a reasonable time having regard to all of the circumstances.
The young person must be put on notice that the application is being made.
3) The Review (Progress) Report is a form of disclosure for the young person and should be available well in advance of the hearing."
751,"The officer testified that when the ready light came on again, he explained that it was not proper sample; that the accused must take deep breath and blow until the officer told him to stop. note that the accused testified that he was only told once how to give proper sample although he did remember the officer telling him it was like blowing up balloon.","The accused was charged with failure to provide forthwith a breath sample contrary to Criminal Code s.254(5).
HELD: The accused was found not guilty.
The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused.
The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance.
The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample.
There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions."
752,"In the absence of the presentation of opinion evidence on these matters by an expert qualified by the Court to give the required evidence there is no evidence upon which the jury could decide the two fundamental issues which are raised by this case which must be referred to the jury for decision by them namely; whether the standard of care which they are instructed to apply in the circumstances of the case was breached by the defendant lawyers and secondly whether that breach caused the plaintiff, more probably than not, to lose an acquittal upon one or more of the charges upon which she was convicted at the original trial.","The plaintiff brought a professional negligence claim against her former solicitors with respect to their handling of three charges against her for practising medicine without a licence and one charge for providing medical treatment, while not registered under the Medical Professions Act.
The solicitors brought a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A.
HELD: The motion for a non-suit was granted.
The claim was dismissed.
Although given an opportunity, the plaintiff failed to call expert evidence respecting the elements of negligence including the duty of care, standard of care, breach of the duty of care or causation.
The solicitors were awarded one set of costs taxed on column 4."
753,"P-40; (d) The plaintiff’s claim against the Attorney General based on vicarious liability for assault must be struck because the Court has no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon any cause of action relating to any alleged intentional tort committed by any Crown servant or employee that is said to have occurred prior to May 14, 1953; (e) All of the plaintiff’s claims against the Attorney General arising from the conduct of two deceased employees of the Residential School, namely, Sister Elle and Sister Greyeyes are barred by The Trustee Act, R.S.S. 1978, c.","The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA.
The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School.
The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949.
The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19.
A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application.
HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck.
The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953.
The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively.
The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions.
Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c).
The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability.
3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada).
Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial.
4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii).
As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct.
5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada.
6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate.
The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2).
Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24.
7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate.
SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her. 
LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b)."
754,[2] The Court has been presented with a form of judgment bearing the consents of Mr. Stopanski and Ms. Perra. The proposed judgment also provides Ms. Perra is not obliged to pay child support in the foregoing circumstances.,"The Court was presented with a consent judgment.
The respondent was unrepresented.
The Court found the terms of the consent judgment were so unfair as to be unconscionable.
HELD: The Court refused to issue the order on the grounds that the Court must not be seen as legitimatizing, condoning, acquiescing or approving of an unconscionable bargain."
755,"S‑66.1, as am.; (v) The claims in negligence do not disclose any cause of action against the Crown or its agents; (vi) The claims of discrimination have no legal foundation either pleaded, or in existence at the time of the causes of action are claimed to have arisen, and do not disclose any cause of action against the Crown or its agents; (vii) The claims of breach of fiduciary duty do not disclose any cause of action against the Crown or its agents; (b) The applicants have failed to adequately describe an identifiable class of two or more persons who are appropriately represented by the proposed plaintiffs; (c) The applicants have failed to demonstrate that the claims of the class members raise common issues, the resolution of which will advance the litigation proposed; (d) The applicants have failed to demonstrate that class proceeding would be the preferable procedure for the resolution of the claimed common issues; (e) The applicants have failed to demonstrate that there are representative plaintiffs who would fairly represent the interests of the proposed class; (f) The applicants have not produced workable litigation plan, or demonstrated they have the resources to represent the class claimed; and (g) The plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the proposed plaintiffs do not have conflicts with the interests of the other class members.","Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act.
The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment.
They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances.
The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues.
It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion.
It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years.
Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues.
A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis.
Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision.
The Crown did not seek costs."
756,"It was held in that case that the inadequacy of the trial judge=s reasons was an error of law because it prevented the appellate court from assessing whether the trial judge had addressed his mind, as he was required to do under the W.(D.) principle, to the possibility that despite having rejected the evidence of the accused, there might nevertheless, given the peculiar gaps in the Crown=s evidence in that case, be reasonable doubt as to the proof of guilt: at para.","The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, with the only live issue at trial being whether the Crown had proved the absence of the complainant's consent beyond a reasonable doubt.
Appeal dismissed;
the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review.
The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt.
It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence."
757,lump sum has been ordered where the Court is doubtful that the Respondent may honour periodic support payment.,"In a divorce proceeding, the wife claimed lump sum spousal support in the amount of $20,000 to allow her to return to her native country.
She also claimed that periodic maintenance was not appropriate because of the difficulty of enforcement when she is living abroad and referenced two occasions when the husband was paying periodic support that she had to seek the assistance of Maintenance Enforcement.
The husband opposed paying any more spousal support but expressed a preference for lump sum support if he was required to pay more, as it would allow him to move on with his life with his new family.
Husband ordered to pay a lump sum award of $10,000 to wife;
when the parties moved to Nova Scotia, the husband was able to improve his financial situation, while the wife's position deteriorated."
758,"[4] The learned Provincial Court judge granted a conditional discharge with a probation order of one year and a requirement of 200 hours of community service work. 742.3(1) of the Criminal Code and further condition that Mr. Roberts perform 200 hours of community service work, with credit to be given in that regard for any such work performed to date pursuant to the probation order made by the sentencing judge.","The respondent was convicted after trial of fraud exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.
The trial judge granted him a conditional discharge with a probation order of 1 year and a requirement of 200 hours of community service work.
He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000.
The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service.
HELD: Appeal allowed orally.
1) The learned judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1) of the Code.
The sentence imposed did not properly reflect the principle of deterrence or the gravity of the offence.
2) This was a serious fraud accomplished by what the judge called a rather intricate kiting system."

The judge faced the following conflicting submissions: on one hand, Mr. Wulkowicz claimed the credit from the proceeds was $0, and on the other hand, Ms. Murphy claimed it was $35,000 Cdn. The trial judge was unable to come to conclusion on what the exact amount was, but he found it to be approximately what Ms. Murphy owed Mr. Wulkowicz for the real property and vehicles ($15,514.50). [Emphasis added] [27] Finally on this issue, note that the judge did in fact take into account Ms. Murphy’s concerns about living next to Mr. Wulkowicz: 28 The husband has told this Court that he has developed love for the camp land and considers it to be his only home.","The parties separated shortly after relocating from the United States to Nova Scotia.
As part of the divorce, the Supreme Court ordered a division of assets.
Both parties appealed the asset division; in the process, both parties sought to introduce fresh evidence.
The wife also questioned the level of assistance offered by the trial judge to the husband who was self-represented at trial.
Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with the exception that the wife is to be given immediate access to her personal belongings; both applications to introduce fresh evidence dismissed;
on the sparse record before him, the trial judge did not err in his division of assets and did not offer the husband unwarranted assistance as a self- represented litigant.
Faced with two competing claims as to the amount of the proceeds of sale, if any, of one of the parties' properties, the trial judge committed no error in finding the amount owed to be half-way between the two claims and then setting it off against the amount owed to the other party."
761,conclude that the trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in concluding that Roper was unable to perform its obligations under the contract or in rejecting Roper’s contention that Devco’s banking at “C” and “H” tracks contributed to Roper’s inability.,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant.
In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment.
The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals.
The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid.
The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000.
Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents.
The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages.
Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained.
Both parties appealed.
Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed;
the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract.
The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation.
Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach."

763,"Ms. Bryn Stumborg For the Plaintiff Mr. Warren Hope For the Defendant April 28, 2005 L.A. Matsalla, P.C.J. JUDGMENT [1] The plaintiff student argues that she was unjustly dismissed and so she sues the defendant business for wages that she would have earned had she worked to the end of the term of her employment. [11] The issue in this case is whether the defendant employer had just cause to dismiss the plaintiff employee and, if not, the measure of damages to which the plaintiff would be entitled.","The plaintiff student argues that she was unjustly dismissed and so sues the defendant business for wages that she would have earned had she worked to the end of the term of her employment.
The employer argues that the plaintiff was dismissed for cause.
HELD: 1)
The employer spoke to the employee on three occasions about her work and by his own admission, the employee made an effort to improve.
At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment.
It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her.
In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal.
Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.
 2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004.
The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12.
But for her dismissal, she would have worked for the rest of July and for the month of August or 36 days.
3) In this case the plaintiff made reasonable effort to seek and maintain employment.
She earned $657.83.
4) The plaintiff is awarded judgment in the amount of $2,083.73."
764,"[18] In this case, the trial judge concluded however that the erratic driving pattern “...may well have been combination of alcohol and very, very hurting ankle, but certainly some of the driving was result of his impairment....” The only foundation for the conclusion of impairment articulated in his rather rambling reasons for judgment are the references to beer consumption some hours earlier and “[t]he reading shows he is more than twice the legal limit....” The trial judge accepted that the accused’s unsteadiness could have been function of the hurt ankle.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code.
The accused was convicted of impaired driving.
An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge.
HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held.
1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions.
2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment.
What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear.
The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused.
As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered."

Conclusions [39] Accordingly, Mr. Brown is ordered to pay to Ms. Donald for the maintenance of Warren Brown, born February 26, 1986, the sum of $181.00 per month commencing September 1, 2005 and payable on the first of each and every month thereafter up to and including February 1, 2006.","The petitioner seeks an order for ongoing child support based on the Federal Child Support Guidelines.
The respondent seeks an order that his child support obligations for their child ended July 2004 because their child ceased to be a person within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from his mother's charge.
HELD: 1)
The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February.
He returned to high school in the fall of 2004.
He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother.
Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media.
He is still under his mother's charge.
She provides him with room and board.
He is only 19 years old.
He has been pursuing his education.
The fact that he changed his course of study does not disentitle him to consideration for support.
He is a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act.
This will continue until March 2006 when he has completed his current course of study.
2) The respondent's income fluctuates.
It is appropriate to take an average of the last 3 years to determine his income.
 3) Some attention must be paid to the financial ability of each parent to contribute.

766,"[3] Mr. Potter’s interlocutory application before the chambers judge asked for orders requiring the Commission to file complete return as required by Civil Procedure Rule 56.08, staying proceedings pending the judicial review application and returning to him the contents of his email documents which had been obtained by the Commission.","The president of a company against whom the Securities Commission had ordered an investigation applied to the court for certiorari to quash the investigation.
He alleged that the investigators had improperly obtained and used the contents of his email, some of which were subject to solicitor and client privilege.
In the context of the certiorari application, the company president successfully argued that the Commission's return should contain the fruits of the investigation so far and that he should be entitled to examine one of the investigators for discovery.
The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made.
Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside.
The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints.
The decision as to whether or not to release the information sought required the balancing of competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case; the Commission was in the best position to conduct such an exercise."

BETWEEN: COUNTY REALTY LIMITED, company incorporated under the laws of Nova Scotia; (hereinafter referred to as the “Lessor”) and ALTERNATIVE SPORTS LIMITED, company incorporated under the laws of Nova Scotia; (hereinafter referred to as the “Lessee”) and TREVOR CLARENCE SCOTT MULLER (hereinafter referred to as the “First Guarantor”) and CATHERINE MULLER (hereinafter referred to as the “Second Guarantor”) WHEREAS the demised premises are to be used by the Lessee for commercial purposes, AND WHEREAS the First Guarantor and Second Guarantor each agree to guarantee the obligations of the Lessee under this Indenture, [18] The proposed term is set out as follows: II LEASE TERM TO HAVE AND HOLD the Demised Premises unto the Lessee for the term of one (1) year, commencing on the 1st day of September, A.D. 2005, and thenceforth fully to be completed and ended on the 31st day of August, A.D. 2006, unless the Lease is sooner terminated or later extended as provided herein.","When the trustee attended at the premises of the bankrupt, he found the bankrupt's inventory being loaded into a van by the landlord; after obtaining a consent order which allowed it to take possession of the assets for the purposes of compiling an inventory, the trustee brought an application for summary judgment against the landlord.
Application for summary judgment granted.
The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant."
768,"He alleges the defendant is liable to him upon the following three grounds: 1) that by not permitting the plaintiff to make motions or speak to motions at meetings of the council of the R.M. from April 20, 2005 to November 10, 2005, the defendant infringed the plaintiff’s freedom of expression under section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; 2) that the defendant acted without statutory authority in imposing sanctions upon him and that the defendant caused him harm “in the tort of abuse of public office”; and 3) that the defendant “owed duty of care to the plaintiff to ensure that she had clear and explicit statutory authority for the actions she took against him, and failed to discharge that duty of care and thereby caused harm to the plaintiff in the tort of negligence”.","The plaintiff alleges the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and has caused the plaintiff humiliation and distress, through her actions as Reeve of the Council of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood.
The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries.
Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions.
The plaintiff is a councillor.
The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act.
There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council.
The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions.
HELD: The claim is dismissed.
1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter.
While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council.
The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents.
The dispute between the parties is a political one.
A court should be reluctant to get involved.
2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful.
This requirement has not been met.
The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality.
There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant.
As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff.
3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care.
Her actions were not negligent."
769,"(k) Exhibit “K” is copy of an application to the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board dated July 20, 2004 from the United Food and Commercial Workers’ Union, Local 1400. 3. make this Affidavit in support of an application for an Order prohibiting the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board as presently constituted from hearing and/or determining any matter and/or making any Orders involving Wal-Mart Canada Corp.","FIAT: The former vice-president of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan.
He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour.
He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour.
When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application.
Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart.
It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart.
The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart.
HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed.
The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.
 1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit.
This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility.
The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents.
2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents.
There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.
 3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart.
Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations.
Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart.
However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them.
Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath.
Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias.
To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy.
That is not good enough."
770,"Westfair has appealed its conviction on the following grounds: The learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case; The learned trial judge erred in law by failing to apply the doctrine of stare decisis; The verdict was unreasonable by being inconsistent with the acquittal of the appellant in the case of R. Although the trial judge did not discuss this evidence in detail, will briefly summarize the facts surrounding the established system that Westfair had in place at the time of the offence in order to prevent the sale of tobacco to minors.","The appellant appeals its conviction of selling tobacco to a minor contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act.
The appellant argues that the learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case.
HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is entered.
 1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place.
2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence.
The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes.
This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person.
By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law.
Had the appropriate standard of due diligence been applied to the facts of this case, the appellant would have succeeded."
771,"Block, Q.C. Respondents and The Toronto-Dominion Bank Intervenor Judge: The Honourable Justice Thomas Cromwell in Chambers Application Heard: January 11, 2007, in Halifax, Nova Scotia Held: Leave to amend notice of appeal granted.","The appellants applied for leave to amend their notice of appeal in regard to an order requiring them to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications.
The application was opposed, inter alia, on the basis that the allegations which underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the trial judge, were irrelevant on the application and were not ruled on by the trial judge.
Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed;
the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent.
The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal.
It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make.
The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal."
772,"[8] In cross-examination herein the accused was reminded of the contents of the letter dated July 11, 2005 from S.G.I., in which he was told that consumption of any alcohol would cause the original driver’s license suspension period to be reinstated, and require him to attend programming.","The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then.
The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification?
HELD: The accused is not guilty.
1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration.
Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2)
The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time.
Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later.
At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief.
Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision.
As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope.
Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer.
As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty."
773,"v. Munson, Scheibel J., of the Court of Queen’s Bench, stated at paragraph 20: [20] The onus is on the accused to establish that there is fair and reasonable probability of partiality or prejudice in the community to the extent that full, fair and impartial trial cannot be held in the venue where it is alleged the offence occurred.","FIAT: The accused applicant brings an application for a change in venue in this matter pursuant to s. 599(1) of the Criminal Code.
HELD: 1). The application for a change of venue is denied.
2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue.
There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports.
However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application.
In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue.
However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found.
Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre.
It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered."
774,"It is the applicants’ position that the election which took place on January 18 is nullity because of the short notice, and therefore there was no legal school community council for the Board to consult with once the decision was made to close the Wilcox School; ergo the Board has not, and cannot, meet the statutory requirements for school closure this year because the Act states school may only be closed in the months of July and August.","FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school.
They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed.
HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case.
1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case.
The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity.
There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council.
There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided.
No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election.
The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding.
The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made.
To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process.
2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair.
A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter."
775,"1. Orders Applied For Against BJ Services: [36] The plaintiff applies for orders requiring BJ Services: a) To answer questions asked during the Wilson Examination about PSAC documentation related to the PST issue; and b) To provide detailed list of documents in its possession or power which it objects to produce including, in particular, documents “between or among” members of PSAC relating to the PST issue over which claim of privilege is asserted, and the basis for such privilege with respect to each document.","FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery in this action pursuant to Rules 222, 231 and 232 of the Queen's Bench Rules and an order requiring the third parties to provide further and better disclosure of documents in their power pursuant to Rules 212 and 215.
HELD: 1) A party to litigation cannot decline to answer questions on an examination for discovery that are intended to elicit the facts on which that party has based its pleading.
A party is required to divulge the facts that it has now or admit that it has none if such is the case.
The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses.
If the position of the defendant as set forth in those responses changes as a result of after acquired information, the defendant shall so inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 90 days following the completion of the defendant's examinations for discovery of the third parties.
If it is necessary for the plaintiff to further examine for discovery on the defendant's responses or supplemental responses, the defendant's proper officer shall attend such examination for discovery.
2) The material filed satisfies the Court that PSAC documents relating to the PST issue are at least broadly relevant to the issues and that BJ Services likely has the power to obtain and produce them.
The fact that BJ Services may intend to claim a litigation privilege over the documents, or that PSAC may not produce them, does not relieve BJ Services of the obligation to disclose their existence.
BJ Services shall provide further and better disclosure of documents by providing a detailed list of documents referred to in the second part of the second schedule of its statement as to documents.
If a claim for privilege is asserted over such documents, BJ Services shall identify the basis of such claim, the date of the documents, the name of the sender and the names of the recipients."
776,"[24] In this case, Ms. Stephen requested that recuse myself for no reason other than that she had previously appeared before me in the Small Claims Court as named party in connection with the legal retainer immediately preceding the one in this case.","The applicant law firm applied for a taxation of accounts in a complicated family law matter.
The client contended that there was obvious overbilling and that the solicitor was negligent in failing to specify in an interim Order the actual time at which she had to leave the matrimonial home.
Accounts as presented are certified;
there was no indication whatsoever of overbilling, whether with respect to legal fees or disbursements, and there was no negligence on the part of the solicitor as she had acted reasonably in relying on the representations of the husband's lawyer as to when the Order would be enforced.
It is not always necessary to examine every single entry in detail on a line-by-line basis; an overall view of the entries contained in an account can be taken when assessing reasonableness.
The temporal limitation of cross-examination is within the Small Claims Court's scope of discretion in special circumstances."
777,"2(1)(e) provides: (e) “condominium title”, with respect to the condominium unit for which the title has issued, means the right to: (i) an ownership share in the condominium unit; and (ii) share in the common property; [21] The relevant provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000, with respect to the registration of an interest, are these: 2(1) In this Act: (s) “interest” means any right, interest or estate, whether legal or equitable, in, over or under land recognized at law that is less than title; (t) “interest holder” means person who is registered in the land titles registry as holder of an interest; (u) “land” means: (i) the surface; (ii) mines and minerals; and (iii) unless the context requires otherwise, the condominium units and common property included in condominium plan; Registrable interests 50(1) An application for registration of an interest may be submitted only if the interest, at the time of registration, is: (a) recognized at law as an interest in land; (b) registrable pursuant to any other Act or any Act of the Parliament of Canada; or (c) designated as registrable interest in the regulations.","The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer.
The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into.
In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant.
The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land.
The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages.
The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest.
The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000.
The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
 1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2)
The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property.
The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'.
Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect.
3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent."
778,"[2] In October of 2007, Ms. Jeffrey made an application under the Maintenance and Custody Act. She sought an order that would provide: a) parenting provisions as to their son; and b) child maintenance payable to her in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines in the form of table amount and contribution to special or extraordinary expenses, and that the order would be retroactive to the date of the couple’s separation.","At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007).
Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009.
The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years.
The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines.
She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it.
The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands.
Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward.
The father's hardship arguments rejected.
He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income.
The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient.
Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied.
The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses.
During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family."
779,"[3] The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences, particularly in light of the volume of trafficking and lengthy period of time over which it had taken place, the highly dangerous nature of the substances sold, which included crack cocaine, the fact that they were working for a criminal organization and the fact that their motivation was financial gain.","The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition.
On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts.
They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party.
The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences.
The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature.
The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders.
The Court found the sentences must be set aside.
The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment.
HELD: The total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served."
780,"8. Neither Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. nor Garry Varga holds Forest Product Processing Facility Licence issued by the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment pursuant to The Forest Resources Management Act, c. In the opinion of Mr. Brown, the creation of chisum log is processing and must require Forest Product Processing Facility Licence.","The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act.
The accused corporation assembles log home packages.
The packages are sold to customers across Canada.
The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages.
L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused.
These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences.
In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused.
The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold.
The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence.
The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence.
HELD: 1)
The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'.
Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation.
See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371.
2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market.
Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.
 3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition.
Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4)
The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry.
The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands.
The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence.
5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act."
781,"7) In October, 2007, Melody asked her parents, Art and Laura, if they would care for the boys. MSS was now faced with the following facts that had to be factored into their consideration as to the boys’ continued placement with Art and Laura, namely: (i) Melody said she was molested by Art at age eight and at age 16; (ii) Melody said at age 16 Art had taken pictures of her that were sexual in nature; (iii) Melody’s sister, C., had also said she was molested by Art; (iv) In October, 1989, Court order issued permanently apprehending Melody and her sisters from Art and Laura; (v) Photos were discovered by the teacher of another girl and were given to MSS which then placed them on Melody’s file.","The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption.
Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care.
The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody.
HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister.
As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.
 1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys.
However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context.
There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister.
It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.
 Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them.
When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura.
2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people.
With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level.
Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted.
The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility."
782,"In accordance with paragraph of the order, the parties were to recalculate the amount for the preceding 12 months, as at May 1, 2009, based on the actual Federal Child Support Guidelines (SOR/97-175, as am) (the “Guidelines”) income for the father which income would obviously be determined after income tax returns were exchanged. The mother suggests that, in accordance with the party’s consent order, that the father must continue to pay support from May, 2009 to at least April 30, 2010, based on the 2008 income of the father.","FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008.
She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father.
The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order.
It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1)
The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated.
The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008.
The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return.
She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year.
The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income.
It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months.
It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have.
The severance is included as part of the father's income.
2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income.
The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division.
The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains.
See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177.
3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.
 4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income.
However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment.
As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5)
The mother shall have her costs of $600."
783,"B-3 (BIA) directing that Paragraph 178 (1)(g) does not apply to her outstanding student loans [2] On March 27, 2000 Ms. Field-Currie filed Consumer Proposal under the BIA. [7] Subsection 178(1.1) requires that before can grant relief from student loan debts must be satisfied that: (a) the bankrupt has acted in good faith in connection with the bankrupt’s liabilities under the debt; and (b) the bankrupt has and will continue to experience financial difficulty to such an extent that the bankrupt will be unable to pay the debt.","The bankrupt, who had outstanding student loans of approximately $39,000, applied for relief under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.
She had completed her studies to become a teacher 13 years ago and had erroneously been advised that a consumer proposal would discharge these loans.
Although both she and her husband had good incomes, it would still take several more years to discharge the loans without prejudicing her family's reasonably frugal lifestyle.
Relief granted;
to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties.
The bankrupt had acted in good faith and had been unable to service the loans in the early years when she did not have permanent employment.
Compromising the debt and requiring her to only pay half of it was not an available option."

They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel').
More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages.
GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases.
They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party.
Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed.
There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson.
The releases were clear and unambiguous.
Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident.
They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel.
While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'.
Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general.
GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs.
To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process."
785,"On the other hand it appears that RCMc, with a memory but virtually no ability to participate in the court proceeding in any meaningful way, meets the limited cognitive capacity test as enunciated in Jobb [34] As RCMc meets the limited cognitive capacity test for the three branches of the test, I find him fit to stand trial.","The accused was subject to a hearing to determine whether he was fit to stand trial on charges under the Criminal Code.
The accused was grossly lacking in mental abilities, had limited and basic comprehension, had the mental capacity of a young child and these facts were not likely to change anytime soon.
The accused had extreme difficulty paying attention to the court proceedings and appeared incapable of doing so.
He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD:
The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability.
The accused said that his lawyer was the judge, could not answer when asked what the judge's role was and he had limited insight into why he was in Court.
The accused met the portion of the limited cognitive capacity test which requires an understanding of the nature of the proceedings and their possible consequences and the accused is capable of communicating his version of the events surrounding the allegations, but there is no possibility he could participate in a meaningful way in the trial.
According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence.
The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding."
786,"March 4, 2011 [1] ACS seeks an order from this court requiring the legal office of Eggum, Abrametz and Eggum to produce to the sheriff of the Judicial Centre of Prince Albert, the shares owned by Barry Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co. Ltd., pursuant to the June 5, 2001 writ of execution ACS has against Barry Jensen, within seven days of service of the order compelling production of the shares. The letter indicated that Mr. Abrametz was claiming solicitor’s lien against the shares owned by Barry Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co. Ltd.","A judgment issued from the Court along with a writ of execution.
The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares.
The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected.
At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act.
HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750.
1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted.
There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated.
2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails."
787,"December 19, 2011 INTRODUCTION [1] On December 13, 2011, the accused, Philip Edward Mullins was found guilty of three counts contained in an Amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: Count 1: That he, on or about the 25th day of August, 2010, at or near Estevan Saskatchewan, did unlawfully possess a controlled substance included in Schedule 1 to wit: cocaine (benzoylmethylecgonine) for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to section 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Count 2: That he, on or about the 25th day of August, 2010, at or near Estevan Saskatchewan, did unlawfully possess a controlled substance included in Schedule I to wit: cannabis (marihuana) for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to section 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Count 3: That he, on or about the 25th day of August, 2010, at or near Estevan Saskatchewan, did unlawfully have in his possession property (or proceeds of property), to wit: cash of a value exceeding $5,000.00 knowing that all (or part) of the property was obtained (or derived directly or indirectly) as a result of the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to section 354 and 355 (a) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code.
At issue was the accused's sentence.
The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis.
As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence.
As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit.
The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed."
788,"The Province’s submission assumes that: (1) the Province would succeed on the appeal; (2) between today and the release of the Court of Appeal’s decision, the Province would incur expense to defend the class proceeding additional to those expenses that the Province would have to pay anyway to respond to whatever claims would survive or emanate from the Court of Appeal’s decision; (3) the plaintiffs would be ordered to pay the Province’s additional costs; and (4) the plaintiffs would be unable to satisfy that judgment.",", motion denied.
While the province has an arguable appeal, it does not concern a summary judgment motion that would result in the claims being dismissed outright.
If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims.
The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding.
There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved.
The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file.
To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost."
789,"J.M. had called Kyle at 8:21 a.m. from [editorial note- telephone number removed], (a number listed in Kyle’s contacts as “JMac” whom Ms. Chase identified as J.M.) Almost immediately he asked Kyle, did “they get anything?” to which Kyle replied: “Yeah, think so…I don’t know, the Tec, think the Tec was there or somethin.” [163] Torina had told Kyle in their earlier conversations that the police knew what they were looking for, that it wasn’t drugs and that “we had nowhere to put that other one.” (Intercept 55, session #4058) Kyle plainly knew what was under discussion as he had just observed that “that’s gonna be like three years.” He subsequently told J.M. his dad is “probably gonna get like five years.” The recognition that possession of prohibited firearm attracts serious prison time is also mentioned by Kyle in one of his January 15 texts, obtained in the forensic analysis of his cell phone.","The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking.
The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms.
The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms.
A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession.
One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents.
Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm.
It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located.
However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed.
The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others.
The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities.
Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his."
790,"Dunphy, Q.C. for the Defendant By the Court: [1] These are reasons for decision in fixing an award of costs to the Defendant, D.R. Breton Limited upon is successful motion to strike out discovery subpoenas issued by the Plaintiff, Northern Pulp Nova Scotia Corporation.","The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered.
As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates.
The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays.
While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot.
The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion.
The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief.
The motion was heard over approximately one-half day.
Motion granted.
The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs.
The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process.
It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike.
The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to.
Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong.
His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response.
Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism."
791,"written estimate was provided by the defendant as follows: Patch and re-tape drywall cracks in all ceiling and walls, to ready the walls for painters Total material and labour $2,480.00 Replace two skylights with new high quality skylights, including all materials to seal and waterproof Total labour and materials, including skylights 3,840.00 Remove wall in bedroom to make one room Total labour 580.00 [4] The original estimate was agreed to by the plaintiffs; the defendant began work on or about March 24, 2011. [37] Mr. Harder complains that the plaintiffs’ claim exceeds the amount they would have paid for the original job, but that is to be expected given the repair involved the removal and dismantling of some of his work before it could be redone, along with the replacement of the damaged countertop.","The plaintiffs hired the defendant to perform renovations to their home.
The plaintiffs terminated the contract believing the defendant's workmanship was poor and that he caused some damage to their home and created a mess.
The plaintiffs sued the defendant alleging damages.
The defendant counterclaimed the cost of the work completed but for which he was not paid and compensation for the lost use of his tools.
HELD: The Court granted judgment for damages in the amount of $3,822 for necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning expenses and granted the counter-claim in the amount of $580 for unpaid work performed by the defendant and then applied setoff.
The Court allowed the cost of issuing the claim and for reasonable cost of service."
792,"The plaintiff argues that the delay of roughly four years from the filing of the statement of defence to the date of examination for discovery is not an inordinate as they were heavily involved in the matter dealing with the other file, the suit against Wawanesa. Second issue application to produce settlement amounts [14] The applicant/defendant also applies to the court for an order to force the plaintiff to disclose the settlement amounts from its settlement in the Wawanesa claim.","The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant.
In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire.
He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001.
In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff.
The defendant filed his defence in April 2007.
Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011.
At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused.
The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit.
The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution.
The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable.
The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis.
Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference.
2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant.
3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings.
4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered.
5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control.
The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications.
Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery."
793,"718.2 court that imposes sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles: (a) sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor, (ii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender’s spouse or common-law partner, (ii.1) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused person under the age of eighteen years, (iii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused position of trust or authority in relation to the victim, (iv) evidence that the offence was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with criminal organization, or (v) evidence that the offence was terrorism offence shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances; (b) sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances; (c) where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh; (d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and (e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.","The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code.
The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed.
The accused is 52 years old and in poor health.
He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders.
The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence.
Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community.
The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed?
HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse.
2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women.
3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c).
The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system.
The appropriate sentence should be 7 years.
As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis.
The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol."
794,"The judge further observed that, as of the date of his decision, Ms. Brinkman and Mr. Tropeau had already been without the Vehicle for some nine months because it had been held by the Director pending the outcome of his application. He says the judge erred by: (a) considering certain information about the circumstances of Ms. Brinkman and Mr. Tropeau even though that information had been submitted by those two individuals as part of their arguments rather than formally by way of affidavit; (b) characterizing the evidence of Sgt. Pfeil as having been made on information and belief; (c) failing to give primacy to the interests of the public and, in particular, failing to consider the need to deter crime, the need to remove the profit from crime and the need to compensate victims; and (d) taking into account the fact that the vehicle had been been held by the Director for 90 days.","HELD: The applicant’s first two grounds of appeal related to the evidence of the respondents’ and police.
The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that questions of evidence were of sufficient importance to grant leave.
The applicant’s third ground was that the Chambers judge failed to take into account the interests of the public, particularly, the need to deter the public and the need to remove profit from crime to compensate victims.
The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground.
The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account.
The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days.
The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal."
795,"RIGHT TO COUNSEL DEFENCE ARGUMENT [3] The defence argued that, since the accused had been allowed to call his wife from his cell phone in the police cruiser on the way to Carlyle, the investigating officers should have waited reasonable time for the accused’s wife to call him back.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08.
The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer.
He did not receive a call back from his wife.
The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available.
The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid.
After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find.
The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.'
The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value.
The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call.
The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape.
The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio.
The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel.
HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter.
Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action.
There was no obligation on the part of the RCMP to provide the accused with a Prosper warning.
The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer.
The officer was justified in assuming that the accused was satisfied with the legal advice he had received.
The Crown stayed the impaired driving count prior to the conclusion of the trial.
The videotape evidence was not relevant to the .08 offence because all observations were made at roadside.
The video would not have shown anything of relevance to the charge.
There is no breach of the accused's rights under s. 7.
The Certificate of Analysis was admitted into evidence and the accused was convicted of the .08 charge."

The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children.
They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated.
The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access.
The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister.
HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b).
The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister.
Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change.
The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister.
The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father."

He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment.
In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA).
The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole.
The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence.
Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012.
At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention.
These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan.
The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code.
The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012.
The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application.
The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour.
Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA.
HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed.
The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply.
Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent.
The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA.
The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application."
798,"[37] Lisa offered the advice that if the court makes her the primary parent, she would agree that Kelly should have Madison for three weekends of each calendar month and half of all school holidays. However, should Kelly and Lisa not be able to agree on the specific division of the summer school recess, the court orders that Madison shall spend alternating weeks with each parent.","The parties had a shared parenting arrangement since separation where each party parented their four-year-old child for equal times in a two-week cycle, the petitioner parenting in her home in Moose Jaw and the respondent parenting in his parent's home in Regina.
The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school.
Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent.
The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application.
The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents.
The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child.
The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make.
HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child.
The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent.
The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents.
The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's.
Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan.
The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain.
The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina.
The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime.
The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend.
The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays.
The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two.
The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year.
Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.
Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days.
The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement."
799,"(Back-Track), filed in these proceedings as Exhibit P-1, supports Mr. Charbonneau’s belief that damage which occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of substance from the back alley. There is no evidence that Mr. Statchuk used soil sterilant in his yard or in the back alley.","The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed.
The plaintiff had not proven his claim on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was responsible for the damage to his lawn."

[14] In the result, the respondent’s voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income is found to be insufficient grounds to vary his child support obligation.","HELD: The court dismissed both applications.
The respondent’s voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income was insufficient grounds to vary his child support application.
The court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances with regard to the petitioner’s application."
802,"The plaintiffs duly submitted their claim for their said loss and damage together with proofs of loss required by SMI, but SMI has refused to settle on reasonable basis, instead using bad faith, ‘stonewalling’ tactics including: PARTICULARS OF BAD FAITH a) Failing to reasonably investigate and evaluate the plaintiffs’ claim when SMI’s agrologist committed material errors including having the land location wrong, the crop description wrong, the crop insurance zone comparison wrong and the plaintiffs’ loss consequently understated; b) Following its faulty investigation and erroneous evaluation, on May 18, 2011 ‘low-balling’ the plaintiffs’ claim by offering $32,511.96 in settlement; c) Having reached an erroneous conclusion regarding the plaintiffs’ loss, then refusing to either revisit or revise that conclusion in the light of subsequent information; d) Using incompetent or inadequately trained personnel for the investigation and evaluation of the plaintiffs’ claim; e) Failing to adopt and implement reasonable standards for the prompt investigation and settlement of claims including the plaintiffs’ claim arising under the first defendants’ policy; f) Not attempting in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlement of the plaintiffs’ claim as submitted in which liability is clear; g) Compelling the plaintiffs’ to institute this lawsuit to recover amounts due under its policy with the first defendants by offering substantially less than the said loss; h) Forcing the plaintiffs to litigate its valid claim, with attendant delay and cost, as strategy of wearing them down to accept settlement for less than the value of the loss; warranting in accordance with the rule in Whiten Pilot Insurance Co. punitive damages for the purposes of retribution, deterrence and denunciation and further or in the alternative solicitor and client costs of the litigation.","Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility
HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it.
The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants.
SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance.
The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation.
The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs.
Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured.
The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success.
The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material.
The improper material included information on settlement discussions."
803,"An error which involves the weighing or assessment of the evidence and the determination of what did or did not happen is an error of fact.) [8] The Company’s central complaint is that neither the appeal judge nor the trial judge understood the significance of exhibit P-5, drawing which shows the effect that water washes would have had on efforts to seed particular tract of land owned by Knudsen.","The court denied leave to appeal.
The applicant’s proposed grounds of appeal were not questions of law but of fact."
804,"[14] The actus reus that the Crown must prove, beyond reasonable doubt, may be summarized as follows: (a) failing to instruct Mr. Cruse on how to unplug blockage in receiving pit (counts and 2); (b) failing to train and supervise Mr. Cruse so as to ensure his health and safety when responding to blockage in receiving pit (counts and 4); and (c) failing to ensure that Mr. Cruse was made aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in receiving pit (counts and 6).","HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee.
The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies.
The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner.
The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit.
The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him.
The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures.
The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown.
The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally.
The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business.
The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety.
The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task.
The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2.
The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4.
The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain.
The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved.
The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence."
805,"In particular, the appellant argues the Tribunal gave no reasons or insufficient reasons for the following: (a) Rejecting or ignoring the appellant’s evidence as to lack of procedural fairness in the pre-suspension period; (b) Dismissing expert evidence (i.e. the July 31, 2015 Dr. Olatunbosun opinion letter) and legal submissions as to the appropriate process to follow where physician’s competence has been impugned; (c) Rejecting or ignoring evidence, including expert evidence, for all five of the cases reviewed and failing to determine the factual basis (or lack of same) for the SMO’s decision to suspend the appellant; (d) Failing to analyze or address the appellant’s submissions on issues that were central to the disposition of the appeal.","HELD: The appeal was granted on the basis of the first two grounds as well as others.
The court quashed the tribunal’s decision and reinstated the appellant’s hospital privileges.
The court reviewed the transcript of the tribunal’s hearing and its written decision.
With regard to the first two issues, it found that the tribunal had erred in law in the following ways: 1) by failing to conduct a de novo hearing as required.
It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision.
It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent.
It merely accepted the evidence of the SMO’s experts."
806,"[37] In assessing whether the actus reas of this offence had been made out on the evidence before her, the trial judge made the following findings of fact: In the present case, Ms. Stets testified that she was driving down the road when she noticed that the accused was following her.","HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed.
The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it.
Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account.
The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial.
There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach.
The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling.
On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse.
She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver.
The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider.
It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge."
807,"Unjust Enrichment and Trust Remedies [21] Turning then to the question of whether expenditures for upkeep and improvements by one joint owner can result in that owner establishing an equitable proprietary interest in property, first note that cases which dealt with claims for unequal contributions under the Act have made adjustments for these “equities” when distributing the sales proceeds.","HELD: The application was granted.
The court ordered that the property be sold and the proceeds of sale take into account the amount necessary to protect the respondent father’s claim.
The Partition Act, 1868 applies in the province.
It did not allow the equitable principles of unjust enrichment and constructive trust to operate to create a proprietary interest.
The court found that s. 4 of the Act applied, which provides a monetary remedy so that if the respondent father could establish entitlement to some amount for his maintenance and improvement costs, he would be protected for that amount for his costs."
808,"December 21, 2017 Introduction [1] The applicants Kent Jones [Kent] and Rodney Argue [Rodney] ask the Court to remove the respondent Evan Jones [Evan] as an executor of the estate of Edna May Jones.","HELD: The application was granted.
The court ordered the removal of the respondent as an executor in the grant of probate and ordered that the applicants remain as executors but that they should take no further steps to distribute the assets of the estate.
It found that there were “special circumstances” within the meaning of s. 17 of The Administration of Estates Act.
The respondent was entitled to challenge the validity of the will but not entitled to remain as an executor."
809,"[9] As the court understands it, insofar as material changes in circumstances are concerned, Mr. Reid relies upon the following: i) his intention to retire early from the Canadian Armed Forces which will reduce his income from $67,000 to $37,500; ii) the fact that Ms. Ellis-Reid has not applied for split in his CPP credits (which he supports) which may make her eligible for disability pension; and iii) Insofar as his child support obligations are concerned, his daughter, Elizabeth, receives incomes and financial support for her university studies from student loans, bursaries, scholarships and summer and part-time academic year employment.","HELD: The application was dismissed.

It ordered the respondent to immediately proceed to complete an application to split the applicant’s CPP credits."

(page 507) The court determined that reasonable notice is implied by law and held that the particular contract was to preserve confidentiality as condition of the employment and was not intended to deal with general terms of employment.","In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice.
The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment.
The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta.
The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months.
He was also awarded the loss resulting from the difference in vacation and loss of an auto allowance for the 15 months.

812,"Counsel for the respondents takes the position and Mr. Justice Matthews has agreed that as Ritchie's initial opinion of an $11,000.00 projected profit for the Yarmouth franchise was not passed on to Mr. Murphy, coupled with the fact that the subsequent projections prepared by Mr. MacDougall of profit per year of $33,000.00 was used to induce Mr. Murphy to enter the franchise agreement and that Mr. Murphy was not advised he would personally have to work full time to meet that projection if there were only two employees as was the basis of MacDougall's projections, the appellant acted in such an unconscionable manner in inducing Mr. Murphy to enter the franchise agreement that the exculpatory clauses are not enforceable.","The appellant, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of a major international company, induced the respondent to enter a franchise agreement by making representations as to the viability of the venture.
The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause.
Allowing the appeal in part,
that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct;
and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent.
In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable."

820,"will review some of the cases decided under these other Acts that provide for registration of documents relating to personal property transactions as the language of these statutes as to the effect of registration is very similar to that in the Assignment of Book Debts Act. The language of each of these Acts (registration statutes) generally provide that the interest in property that is created or reserved by chattel mortgages, conditional sales agreements, assignments of book debts and corporate debentures are void against creditors and subsequent purchasers or mortgagees for valuable consideration and without notice unless the document is registered under the relevant Act. None of the Nova Scotia registration statutes contain any express words that establish priority based on date of registration of documents registered under the respective Acts.","This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve.
Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants.
The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band.
He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1).
He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them.
The appellants appealed.
Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act,
that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans.
When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians.
Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments.

The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases.
There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement.
The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title.
HELD: Declaration denied.
Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs.
1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.
 2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him.
His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego.
This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act.
3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years."

The accused argued that the Crown had failed to make proper disclosure contrary to s.7 of the Charter and that the trial judge has misapplied the concept of reasonable doubt.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
1)The failure of the Crown to disclose was not raised at trial as it should have been.
If the matter had been raised at trial and the judge then thought that the evidence not disclosed impacted the accused's defence, he could have adjourned the trial.
2)The evidence not disclosed would not have affected the accused's defence in any event.
3)On the issue of reasonable doubt, the trial judge could reasonably have convicted on the evidence, and the Court would therefore not substitute its own view of the evidence."

HELD: The application to exclude evidence is denied.
1)The officers were lawfully present in the premises when Sergeant Bell inadvertently found the knapsack and its contents which were in plain view.
He reasonably believed that the knapsack and the contents were evidence of a crime.
Therefore it was neither unreasonable nor unlawful for him to seize these items.
The search was authorized by law and the manner in which it was carried out was reasonable.
2)Even if the accused's rights under s.8 of the Charter had been violated this would not be a proper case to exclude the evidence under s.24(2) of the Charter.
The fairness of the trial will not be affected by the admission of the evidence.
The manner in which the search was conducted was neither abusive nor excessive.
The evidence was in plain view and was found inadvertently.

The plaintiff alleged the contract price was in error and sought rectification of the contract.
The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had.
HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed.
1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted.
He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement.
The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.
 2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention.
3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest.
The plaintiff was entitled to interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act on the claim for extras to the contract. 4)The claim for the extras was never in dispute.

826,An order directing the closure of the Saskatoon operation and the return of company assets to the Rural Municipality of St. Andrews (Rosetown District) unless written consent to such operation in Saskatoon is granted by Bondco.,"The question was whether a corporate board could breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government sponsored community bond program in order to establish its business.
The Shareholders' Agreement obliged all shareholders to vote their shares so as to confirm the nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard for its performance.
As a result the board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though the Government of Saskatchewan and Bondco were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the company, they could not change the board and did not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes.
Members of Bondco were concerned that jobs were being obtained in Saskatoon at the expense of Rosetown jobs and the economic spin-offs expected from their $800,000 investment were not being realized in Rosetown due to the opening of the Saskatoon facility.
An application was brought under s234 of the Business Corporations Act.
They sought a restraining order enforcing the covenant, an order appointing new directors, an order of compensation for breach of contract and an order directing the closure of the Saskatoon operation and the return of company assets to Rosetown district unless Bondco granted written consent.
HELD: It was ordered that 1)the Shareholders Agreement was amended deleting the offending paragraph concerning the Board of Directors and substituting a new paragraph; 2)certain provisions of the Articles of Continuance as amended were suspended until the Termination Date; 3)the present board was suspended pending the election of directors at a special meeting of shareholders; 4)the respondent was enjoined from moving its operations and from transferring or hiring employees at any place other than Rosetown District unless Bonco's written consent was filed with the Court.
5)The Chief Executive Officer was not displaced nor was the Saskatoon operation directed to be closed.
 6)Bonco was entitled to its taxable costs against the individual respondents."

(3) The respondent shall assume and pay the transportation costs for the petitioner's exercise of access to Kimberley and Lauri twice monthly.","FIAT. Interim custody of two of the children was awarded to the respondent in January 1997.
The eldest resided with her mother.
Decisions on child and spousal maintenance, including costs of access and counselling had been reserved.
HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay interim maintenance of $388 per month for the child residing with the mother and $350 per month for interim spousal maintenance.
Under the guidelines he would be required to pay $1,165 per month for three children at an income level of $38,000.
No abatement was made in view of the petitioner's modest income.
2)The respondent was to assume costs of twice monthly access by the petitioner and counselling costs.
3)The petitioner was to keep the respondent informed of her employment status and revenue.
4)Interim custody and access was to be reviewed July 4/97 if the parties had not settled the matter."
828,"Upon completion of her analysis she determined that: It follows that before entering on the merits of an application to vary custody order the judge must be satisfied of: (1) change in the condition, means, needs or circumstances of the child and/or the ability of the parents to meet the needs of the child; (2) which materially affects the child; and (3) which was either not foreseen or could have been reasonably contemplated by the judge who made the initial order. The applicant concedes the respondent is good mother and there is nothing which puts into dispute the close relationship which exists between the respondent and her (c) To permit the child's residence to be changed pending trial, will impact negatively upon the existing access arrangements and the relationship between the applicant and his daughter; (d) To permit change in residence pending trial will result in disruption to the child consequent upon removal from the community she has grown up in.","An application to vary the terms of a 1995 consent judgment such that the applicant would have sole custody.
Alternatively he sought an order preventing the mother from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan.
The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion.
The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994.
The father had exercised regular and frequent access.
She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties.
Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home.
HELD: 1)Relocation was neither foreseen nor reasonably contemplated by the judge making the original order.
The threshold criteria was thus satisfied.
2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence.
The child had a close relationship with both parents.
The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed.
3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied.
If the mother proceeded with her move a revision of the access provision would be appropriate. 4)The child's best interest is the proper test to be applied (Cote) having regard to the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon.
5)The applicant became aware in early June of the mother's intention to move to British Columbia and did not object.
The timing of the application, a few weeks prior to the proposed move, raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application.
 6)Costs were left to the trial judge."
829,"b. The Second Ground of Appeal The second ground of appeal on the leave application alleges that the arbitrator erred in law ""in (sic) its award of damages for winter construction, in that the award is unsupported by the evidence and in direct contradiction to the evidence of the Respondent"".","The contract for the construction of a spur rail line to the grain terminal provided that either party could refer any contract dispute to arbitration.
The Arbitrator's award favoured the A &amp; E Rail Contractor's position.
Leave to appeal had been granted.
At issue was were whether the arbitrator applied the correct measure of damages and whether there was any evidence to support the findings of fact.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed.
The respondent's application for enforcement of the award was granted without costs.
1)The issues were questions of fact not law.
The errors complained of were the same questions referred to the arbitrator for determination.
Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law.
The wording on the second issue was changed slightly to read 'in his calculation as to damages awarded for increased costs of winter construction'.
There was some evidence upon which the arbitrator could make a finding of fact.
2)As none of the bars set out in the Act applied the court was required by s50(3) to give judgment enforcing the award.
 3)The application for costs on a solicitor and client basis was denied.
Failing agreement between the parties, the appellant would pay the respondent's taxed costs on the appeal on a party and party basis."
830,"The petitioner seeks an order under The Dependents' Relief Act, R.S.S. 1978, c.D-25 that the child Tyson share equally with his brother, Evan, in the estate of the deceased.","The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father.
Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties.
The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one.
The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses.
The eldest required braces.
The mother's income was $1,089 per month.
The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order.
The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children.
The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance.
HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance.
Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.
 1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application.
The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander).
A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor.
The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently.
The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children.
3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles.
Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.
 4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate."

The appellants appealed.
They argued that the trial judge, by measuring the respondent's loss on the basis that he should be put in the position he would have been if the financial statements had been accurate, had applied the wrong test.
Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600,
that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages.
The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company.
The damages are the amount by which the actual value of the company was less than what the respondent paid at the time of purchase."

The matter was remitted to the Labour Relations Board to be dealt with having regard to the finding that the closure of the vacuum division is not a 'technological change' within the meaning of s43(1)(c) of the Trade Union Act.
1)The Board made a patently unreasonable error.

HELD: 1)The father was to pay monthly child support of $754.19, retroactive to September 1/98.

HELD: The application was dismissed.
The delay was not unreasonable.
 1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay.
Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest.
The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay.
His right to security of person and to liberty were not affected.
3)Seven months delay was due to scheduling delays resulting from defence's application to remove prosecution counsel who had previously represented the accused.
The Crown acted in good faith in opposing the application and had a meritorious position.
4)All other proceedings were within the systemic guidelines.
5)Prejudice to his liberty was minor as he was on bail since shortly after his arrest.
He was able to make full answer and defence.
He was employed throughout since his release.
His inability to enter long term contracts or travel out of province would have existed for 21-1/2 months of the 25 month delay in any event. 6)Individual and family stress is to be expected.

The appellant had his appeal denied on the grounds that the decision of the Hearing Officer was not patently unreasonable.
Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for re-hearing, that an appeal from a Hearing Officer to the Tribunal is a statutory appeal.
It is not a judicial review, and the standard of review is therefore one of correctness not whether or not the Hearing Officer's decision was patently unreasonable.
The deference that the Tribunal must show is only with respect to the advantages the Hearing Officer may have in the fact finding process of a particular case."
838,[17] Counsel for Mr. Compain argues that the Royal Bank did not act fairly or in good faith by reporting to Equifax his default or delinquency upon the two loans in all of the circumstances.,"In issue was whether the Bank breached its lending contract, its fiduciary duty or duty of confidentiality; and if so, what damages, if any, should be awarded.
The defendant's bank loans fell into default after SGI disability benefits were terminated.
The Bank reported the particulars of the loan defaults to a credit reporting agency (Equifax).
The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans.
The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement.
The bank commenced this action for payment.
The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract.
HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims.
The bank's claim was admitted at trial.
1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement.
The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate.
Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case.
3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business."
839,"Accordingly, there will also be an order that during the term of the conditional order the bankrupt will be required to make regular instalment payments on his self-employment income and comply with income tax and G.S.T. filing requirements.","The bankrupt was self-employed and failed to pay his taxes, owing Revenue Canada $89,000.
The trustee calculated surplus income at $435 per month and recommended a conditional order of discharge requiring the payment of $7,800.
Revenue Canada objected, requesting a conditional order for monthly payments of $750 over 4 years.
HELD: Conditional order of discharge granted.
The court found that the bankrupt was 43 years old, in good health and with no dependents.
The bankrupt was also a self-employed contractor with an 'enviable' income.
Following a review of the bankrupt's financial material on file, the court ordered the bankrupt to pay $500 per month for 3 years, to make regular installment payments on his self-employment income and comply with tax filing requirements."
840,"February 18, 1999 [1] Maureen Janette Rodh (Rodh) seeks an order pursuant to ss.87 and 251 of The Land Titles Act R.S.S. 1978 c.L-15 as amended, cancelling the existing Certificate of Title in the name of John Roman Sarauer (Sarauer) and herself as tenants in common and directing the Registrar of Land Titles at Battleford to issue a new title in their joint names with right of survivorship.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.87 and s.251 of the Land Titles Act cancelling the existing certificate of Title in the names of the deceased and herself as tenants in common and directing the Land Titles Registrar to issue a new title in their joint names with right of survivorship.
The deceased and applicant who had been living together purchased residential property in 1997.
Their lawyer prepared a written agreement for the sellers and purchasers as well as the mortgage describing the purchasers as joint tenants.
The sellers, unrepresented by legal counsel, prepared the transfer of the property and title issued without the words 'joint tenants'.
The error describing the purchasers went unnoticed by their lawyer.
The respondent had been married to the deceased when he died intestate in 1998.
As the title stood an undivided one-half interest was owned by the estate and would devolve to the respondent pursuant to the Intestate Succession Act.
HELD: The Land Titles Office Registrar was to amend the existing certificate of title by inserting 'joint tenants' after the names of the registered owners.
1)The requirements set out in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Rochon were satisfied.
There was an obvious mistake which required rectification.
The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly.
The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did.
2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other."
841,"REASONS FOR JUDGMENT From the evidence at trial that accept, am prepared to find the following material facts: (1) Rajbir Sandhu and Inderjeet Sandhu were married on March 6, 1960 following traditional Sikh religious wedding ceremony; (2) Dr. Gurpreet Sandhu is the natural biological son of Rajbir and Inderjeet and was born in India on December 4, 1961; (3) Inderjeet never received any notice of any divorce proceedings contemplated or commenced by Rajbir; (4) gradual estrangement developed between Rajbir and Inderjeet on account of Rajbir’s extra-marital relationship with Marcelle Cendres; (5) The marital relationship between Rajbir and Inderjeet effectively ended in the autumn of 1967 when Rajbir banished his wife and young son from his parents’ home; (6) The evidence as to whether or not Rajbir and Marcelle went through legitimate civil marriage ceremony at the French Embassy in New Delhi, India on May 2, 1968 as result of which valid marriage certificate was issued, is inconclusive; am unable to decide on the basis of the evidence before me whether Raj and Marcelle were ever in fact legally married; (7) Rajbir and Marcelle met at time that Rajbir was studying law at Yale University. (See Answers to Interrogatories, Exhibit 11] (17) When confronted by friends, Mr. and Mrs. Bhalla in Halifax, Rajbir admitted that Inderjeet was his wife and that Gurpreet was their son; (18) In India Rajbir made public pronouncements (for example the invitation to their son’s wedding; documentation he facilitated in order for Inderjeet to receive her state-funded pension) that Inderjeet was his wife and that Gurpreet was their son; (19) Rajbir failed to provide for Gurpreet in his August ‘97 will, or Inderjeet in any previous wills; (20) On July 25, 1997 Rajbir and Marcelle executed reciprocal wills; (21) On August 2, 1997 Marcelle died in Halifax hospital from the effects of ovarian cancer; (22) On August 22, 1997 Rajbir executed new will after consulting and instructing Frank Powell, Q.C.; (23) On August 31, 1997 Rajbir died in his cottage at Piggott Lake under circumstances that while suspicious were, ultimately, inclusive.","A wife claimed part of the estate of her estranged husband.
The Court considered the applicability of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, the Matrimonial Property Act, and the Pension Benefits Act.
Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate,
that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed.
To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement.
The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator.
This involves a very broad judicial discretion.
Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance."
842,"86(1) of the Assessment Act read: 85 Any person aggrieved by decision of the assessment appeal court, including the clerk on behalf of the municipality and the Director, may appeal therefrom to the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board 86 (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other Act, any person aggrieved by decision of the regional assessment appeal court may appeal by serving notice of appeal, within thirty days from the day when notice of the decision was received, on the clerk of the municipality in which the property is situate, the Director, the person in whose name the property is assessed if he is not that person and the person who appealed the assessment if he is not that person, and by filing copy of the notice of appeal with the Clerk of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board, and not otherwise.","The appellant appealed a preliminary decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board which held that it had jurisdiction to hear an assessment appeal where, although the appellant failed to comply with the service requirement of s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act, the party not properly served waived the requirement.
Dismissing the appeal with costs,
that where the party that was not properly served expressly waived its right to notice as required by statute, the Board had jurisdiction to hear the appeal."
843,"[18] In this case, assuming all of the defendant’s evidence is true, have to agree with counsel for the plaintiff who characterized the plaintiff’s conduct as “griping”, whether it related to Mr. Dust’s absences, Mr. Dust’s estimates of time to perform work on Mr. Conner’s vehicle, or his comments on Mr. Rissling’s lack of knowledge.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause.
The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager.
When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff.
It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination.
There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay.
The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court.
HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment.
Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b).
The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so.
If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact.
The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons.
The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer.
The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function.
'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace.
The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'.
The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings.
3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.
 4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs."
844,"1. Ken Hinz stands charged that on or about the 11th day of May, A.D., 1999, at or near Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, did in committing an assault on Don Brown cause bodily harm to him contrary to Section 267(b) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code.
HELD: The accused was found guilty.
 1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed.
Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm.
The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm.
2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him.
The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm.
While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused.
It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up.
The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions.
A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm."
845,"[4] The appellant is, essentially, asking this court to set aside the trial judge’s credibility findings against him, to take different view of the medical evidence than did the trial judge, and, ultimately, to attribute larger percentage of the appellant’s present health problems to the accident in question, with correspondingly higher assessment of damages against the respondent.","Liability was admitted for a very mild rear end collision.
The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health.
It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem.
The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000.
The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded.
The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed.
Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed.
No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility.
There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment.
Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs.
Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages."
846,"[5] The Notice of Appeal lists seven grounds, which can be summarized as follows: The judge erred: (i) in striking the appellant’s affidavit from the record and in failing to consider three further affidavits filed by the appellant; (ii) in permitting reference to Mr. Barefoot’s affidavit, which had been filed in support of the original recovery order, and in not requiring Mr. Barefoot’s attendance for cross-examination on that affidavit; (iii) in failing to conclude that the respondent had not made full and fair disclosure of the facts on the original application for the recovery order; and (iv) in incorrectly applying the legal principles relevant to Rule 48.08.","Respondent obtained ex parte recovery order.
Appellant applied for the return of the property under Rules 48.06 and Rule 48.08.
Its application was dismissed and the appellant appealed that order.
Appeal dismissed.
The affidavit material filed by the appellant in support of its application was so defective as to be not admissible.
The affidavits contained substantial commentary, opinion and scandalous allegations irrelevant to the matters in issue.
Some portions of the affidavits dealt with the subject matter of the main action which are not to be resolved on an interlocutory application.
The offending material so pervaded the affidavit that it could not be edited out."
847,(orally) [1 Michelle Thorne pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter in respect of the death of Milan Kulas and was sentenced to 2½ years imprisonment.,"The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence of 2.5 years for manslaughter on the grounds it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of deterrence and denunciation.
HELD: A sentence of 5 years of imprisonment was imposed.
The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature.
The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent.
The accused pled guilty, had no criminal record, did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victim who died from the wounds or of the other victim; she intervened to stop the beating although only after being satisfied the alleged the drug dealer had nothing to give the robbers.
 The accused appeared to be doing well in the prison programs.
The sentence of the co-accused who had a record of 40 previous convictions had been increased to the equivalent of more than 10 years imprisonment."
848,"THAT Big Quill is now making this application for an interlocutory injunction to restrain and prohibit PSC Alsask, or any party claiming under or through it, from manufacturing potassium sulphate using the ion exchange technology licensed to it under the Technology Licensing Agreement and, further, for an interlocutory injunction restraining and prohibiting Robert Nylen and/or PSC Alsask, or any party claiming under or through them, from marketing potassium sulphate produced at the plant of PSC Alsask, at or near Alsask, Saskatchewan for the following reasons: (i) That Big Quill has now only been able to establish prima facie case that the ion exchange technology licensed under the Technology Licensing Agreement is being used by PSC Alsask to produce potassium sulphate due to the fact that it only obtained documentation this spring sufficient to confirm the design of PSC Alsask plant and the flow charts illustrating the process being used to manufacture potassium sulphate at the said plant.","The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction pursuant to s.65 of the Queen's Bench Act and Queen's Bench Rule 387(a) prohibiting and restraining the respondents from producing and manufacturing potassium sulphate near Alsask until further order; an order restraining the respondent from selling, marketing, or disposing of the potassium sulphate for profit until further order; other ancillary relief; costs of the application.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents in any event of the cause.
The applicant did not demonstrate an entitlement to injunctive relief on the second and third stages of the three stage test.
The applicant demonstrated there was a serious question to be tried but failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm.
The delay (the action was commenced February 16, 1998) was considered.
On balance the respondents would suffer greater harm if the injunction were granted as the respondent Nylen makes his living marketing and selling potassium sulphate."
849,"REASONS FOR DELAY [13] Mr. MacLean has not given any reasons for not filing a defence in this proceeding, other than his assertion that the originating notice (action) and statement of claim were not served on him.","The respondent entered a default judgment against the applicant and issued an Execution Order.
The applicant applied to have the default judgment set aside on the basis that the Originating Notice and Statement of Claim were never served upon him.
Application dismissed;
on the evidence the documents were served upon the applicant; even though the experienced process server had no independant recollection of service, he swore an affidavit of service which was accepted.
The applicant did not meet the test of a fairly arguable defence and gave no other reasons for not filing a defence other than his allegation that the documents were not served upon him."
850,"136) 9th Ground of Appeal That the learned trial judge erred in law in not responding to defence counsel’s contention, early in the trial, that the four count indictment was duplicitous, particularly given that upon reading the Crown Attorney’s “Theory of the Crown”, prior to giving his jury charge, the learned trial judge was under the impression that the Crown was “scrubbing the criminal negligence charges.” 137) 10th Ground of Appeal That the learned trial judge erred in law in not vigorously ensuring trial fairness first, by prohibiting the juror, Joe Guillena, either before or after he had been selected as the jury foreperson, from carrying his briefcase into the jury room; second, in allowing the Crown Attorney repeatedly to revisit issues that the Crown had not properly explored during direct examination; and third, in not declaring mistrial when it was discovered, on the second day of deliberation, that the jury had access, in the jury room at the Sydney location, to books and materials, including nine copies of three-page document outlining three-pronged test for reaching possible verdict exclusive of the test that if you believe the evidence of the accused you must acquit.","The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol.
The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand.
She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges.
She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence.
Dismissing the appeal,
that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury.
Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial.
Finally, there were no errors by the judge on any of the other grounds advanced for appeal."
851,"It is argued that by interpreting the words “indefinite reduction of hours within department” as being wide enough to encompass the situation where the grievor’s work hours were reduced because of the return to work from maternity leave of another employee with greater departmental seniority, the arbitrator has, in effect, amended or added to the language of Article 9:01.","The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave.
The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority.
The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority.
The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review.
Application allowed;
the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside.
The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision.
Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made."
852,"Atkins of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; (4) Affidavit of Harry Murphy of Facts-Probe Incorporated to which was appended the following exhibits: (a) sample release form used by Honourable Justice Stuart Stratton, Q.C.; (b) copy of the ""Stratton Report""; (c) copy of contract between Facts-Probe Inc. and the Department of Justice; (d) correspondence, described as introductory letter from the Department of Justice dated August 31, 1995; (e) correspondence from the Department of Justice dated December 3, 1996, mandating consent to certain uses to which disclosed information may be used; (5) Notice of Appeal by Lee Keating from the decision of the head of the public body, which notice is dated April 29, 1999 and to which is attached: (a) original application for access dated September 10, 1998; (b) appellant's brief to the review officer dated December 21, 1998; (c) decision of Robert Doherty dated April 12, 1999, refusing access as requested; (6) Affidavit of Amy Parker solicitor of the Department of Justice to which is appended the following exhibits: (a) memorandum of understanding regarding compensation for survivors of institutional abuse; (b) letter from the Department of Justice dated July 18, 1996 to ""counsel for survivors of institutional abuse; (c) letter from the Minister of Justice, Jay Abbass, dated December 6, 1996 to ""all compensation lawyers""; (7) Affidavit of Michael Dempster, former program director of the ""Compensation for Institutional Abuse Program"" to which is appended the following exhibits: (a) November 1997 guidelines for the Compensation for Institutional Abuse Program; (8) Affidavit of Francine McIntyre, clinical therapist; (9) Letter dated May 30, 2000, from the solicitor for the Department of Justice, Edward Gores, to Honourable Justice Margaret Stewart enclosing: (a) Nova Scotia information directory published on the Province's website and (b) Robert Doherty's letter of October 16, 1998, to the appellant, being the first response of the head of the public body to the appellant; (10) Affidavit of Elizabeth Mullaly, solicitor employed by the Province of Nova Scotia in the Compensation for Institutional Abuse Program to which is appended various exhibits demonstrating the documentation methods used by the program.","The applicant was aware that allegations of abuse had been made against him in an alternative dispute resolution process undertaken by the Province with respect to his former employment.
He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations.
The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed.
Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven.
The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo.
The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes.
The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant.
Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province.
There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy.
The applicant was entitled to know what he had been accused of and should have the right to correct the record."
853,"[7] Given the trial judge’s acceptance of the expert evidence that the blood alcohol was rapidly rising, and was in the range of .68 to.81 at 8:00 p.m., along with Mr. Swan’s observation that he did not observe any impairment, the trial judge ought to have concluded that the defence raised reasonable doubt.","The accused was convicted of having care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired (Criminal Code s.253(a)) but acquitted on the charge under s.253(b).
The Provincial Court trial judge did not accept the accused's testimony that his blood-alcohol concentration was between .068 and .081 at the time of driving.
On appeal the Queen's Bench judge set aside the conviction and ordered an acquittal.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The Queen's Bench judgment was set aside and the Provincial Court trial judgment was restored.
While the appellate judge stated the correct standard of review, he did not in fact apply it and made inaccurate assessments of the evidence and conclusion of the trial judge."
854,"[A.R.S.] says both [D.M.] and [B.J.S.] also had knives which had been used to threaten [A.R.S.] and [C.D.] prior to and during this incident. With respect to [B.J.S.], [A.R.S.] says he and [D.M.] were found in the main hallway close to each other.","The 18 year old, charged with the second degree murder of two individuals, applied for release from custody.
HELD: The accused was released on his own undertakings under a set of strict conditions, including participation in an electronic monitoring program.
The onus is on the accused to show cause why his detention in custody is not justified.
Criminal Code s.515(10) now permits detention on three grounds.
His detention was not necessary to ensure his attendance at court nor for the protection or safety of the public.
There was no evidence he posed a substantial likelihood of committing further offences or that he would interfere with the administration of justice if released.
There was no other just cause, including maintenance of confidence in the administration of justice."
855,"From and after November 1992, Sandra Moore (""Sandra"") had both children living with her and maintenance was then payable by Howard in the sum of $4,200.00 per year. According to the records provided, Howard's income for the relevant time periods is the following: 1992 $48,000.00 1993 20,265.00 1994 3,952.00 1995 (social assistance) 3,254.00 1996 5,488.00 1997 17,579.00 1998 21,086.00 1999 29,079.54 [5] The payments made during those years reflected in documents from the Maintenance Enforcement Office in Alberta are the following: 1993: 4,368.00 1994: 1,666.84 1995: 392.98 1996: 1997: 213.86 1998: 2,794.87 1999: 4,917.93 2000: 3,152.00 [6] Up to and including August 18, 2000 Howard is in arrears of payment of $13,693.52.","The father applied to vary the Alberta order by extinguishing his maintenance arrears from January 1993 to the present and for an order eliminating any further obligation to pay child support.
The parties married in 1974 and divorced in 1992.
They agreed to joint custody of their two children in their 1991 separation agreement.
One child was expected to graduate in 2002 and the other in 2003.
The father said he suffered depression and was unemployed for several years.
HELD: Arrears from 1993 were eliminated.
He paid 39, 9 and 0% of the required support in 1994, 1995 and 1996 when his income dropped.
He paid 5% in 1997, 66 in 1998 and 117% in 1999.
Any ongoing obligation was terminated in view of the mother's letter to the Alberta Maintenance Enforcement Office and her representations to the court that she was no longer seeking support."
856,The accused further testified that he did not ask Cpl. McLean to call another lawyer after expressing his dissatisfaction about Legal Aid because he was on the way to the breathalyser room and Cpl. McLean indicated to him that the time was up.,"The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code.
He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing.
HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples.
The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed.
The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer.
Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times.
It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel.
2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks.
The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece.
He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior.
The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted.
It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample.
The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused.
Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition.
He should not drink and drive."
857,"The consent order was granted one month after the respondent had quit his employment at Lilydale Foods in Wynyard. Although he remained unemployed, the respondent agreed to pay child support based upon an imputed annual income of $17,386.00, which is what he had been earning at Lilydale Foods.","FIAT. The father applied to vary the April 2001 consent order, granted 1 month after he quit his employment, by reducing monthly child support payments from $236 to $19.
He agreed to pay support based on an imputed annual income of $17,386, although he remained unemployed.
HELD: A trial of the issue was directed, as it could not be decided on the material filed whether he was intentionally unemployed or underemployed.
The father's circumstances had changed since the consent order.
The fact he no longer resided with a girlfriend and was making payments on a truck did not justify any reduction.
Income should not be imputed based on former employment that is no longer available or practicable."
858,"However, once vehicle is registered following declaration of ownership, presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc.","The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan.
A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001.
After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer.
His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate.
She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession.
At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it.
HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable.
Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance.
The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act.
That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle.
Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry.
Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away.
Ownership does not depend upon registration.
However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership.
A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice.
No costs were awarded on either motion."
859,"In the Koleniec decision, the court indicated that those cases including class gift with named beneficiaries were limited to instances where the named persons consisted of all the potential members of the class.” (emphasis added) [18] In Re Brush 1942 CanLII 94 (ON SC), [1943] D.L.R. 74 (Ont. H.C.), the testator left all of his real and personal estate “equally among my three daughters -Lina- Mabel and Beatrice”.","The testator had prepared his own Will on a pre-printed form and left his assets to his children, whom he then proceeded to name.
One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will.
the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it.
The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention.
Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception.
In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class.
This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given.
The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will."
860,[10] Under the provisions of s.29 of the Act Mrs. Walker is also entitled to seek to vary the terms of the separation agreement entered into between her and her husband upon the equitable grounds as set out in the Act. But does the Nova Scotia court have jurisdiction to vary the terms of separation agreement embodied within the terms of consent order?,"The applicant commenced a divorce action against her husband incorporating a claim for a division of assets under the Matrimonial Property Act.
The Ontario Court had previously granted a consent order incorporating an agreement between the parties purporting to divide matrimonial assets.
The applicant sought to set aside the agreement on the grounds of unconscionability, harshness or fraud.
The court has jurisdiction to vary the agreement on the grounds alleged notwithstanding that the Act does not specifically provide the court with jurisdiction ."
861,"(3d) 150 (released June 17, 1997), at paragraph 31, cited with approval in each of the three cases referred to the court (supra): ""The section simply provides that, prior to making the demand, the peace officer must reasonably suspect that person who is operating motor vehicle (or who is engaged in any one of the other named activities) has alcohol in his or her body.","The accused was charged with driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code.
At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand.
HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted.
There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.
 1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'.
The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand.
2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made.
The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case.
The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion.
The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist."
862,He seeks a fine and an order that the respondent bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. The petitioner may bring the child to Saskatchewan for such access visits but shall not remove the child from Saskatchewan or Manitoba without the written consent of the respondent.,"FIAT. The father applied for an order pursuant to the Children's Law Act s.29(1)(a) finding the mother in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of the August 15, 2002 access order.
He sought a fine and an order that she bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits.
He applied to vary the terms of the access order.
The Court raised jurisdiction, service and time issues.HELD: 1)To avoid adjournment counsel consented to the court's jurisdiction, the acknowledgement of service and the abridgement of time.
2)The mother was found to be in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the order by repeatedly refusing, without lawful excuse, to comply with its terms.
Almost without exception she refused to make the child available for the bi-weekly supervised access visits.
She did not abduct the child.
The mother was to purge her contempt by paying the father's solicitor and client costs respecting the two applications fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order.
The August 15, 2002 order was vacated.
3)The father was to have unsupervised access on alternate weekends.
He may bring the child to Saskatchewan but shall not remove her from this province or Manitoba without the mother's written consent.
The father shall bear the costs of access with partial reimbursement in the amount of $60 per month, which may be deducted from ongoing child support.
He shall give at least seven days notice if he is unable to exercise access.
The mother shall have reasonable telephone access."
863,"Another child of the maternal grandmother, R.S., also supports her having custody and expressed the good care C., D.’s brother, gets.","The mother was unable to care for the child and the father, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was only entitled to supervised access.
Both the paternal and maternal grandmothers presented plans of care to the court, with the paternal grandmother seeking custody and the maternal grandmother seeking care and control of the child.
The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother.
The Agency supported the paternal grandmother.
Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents.
The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody.
The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them."
864,"Riddell, Q.C., for the defendants By the Court: [1] In this action the Plaintiff, Jeanette Cluett (Cluett) claims against Metro Computerized Bookkeeping Limited (Metro) and Ian Hill (Hill) damages for breach of contract in the amount of $20,000 as well as general damages and exemplary damages.","The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for breach of contract in regard to the defendants' refusal to return to her the substantial security deposit that she paid as part of a motel lease.
After being clearly told that the money would not be returned, she waited 9 years before commencing the action.
The plaintiff applied for an order disallowing the defendants' limitation defence.
Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed.
The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled.
Not only was there a presumption that the evidence would now be less cogent than it would have been, but the defendants' storage warehouse was destroyed by fire 3 years ago resulting in the loss of many old records, including those relating to the motel."
865,"[10] Ms. Bemister submits she has established an entitlement to spousal support; that such entitlement was acknowledged by Mr. Bemister when he signed the Agreement to pay her $1,000.00 month indefinitely; further, her financial situation clearly demonstrates her need for such support to continue.","The parties were married for 10 years.
Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home.
Also at issue was the husband's obligation to provide the wife with an automobile pursuant to the separation agreement.
Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile.
The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year.
Although the wife did not establish any disadvantage from the marriage, there were disadvantages relating to its breakdown and her lifestyle deteriorated as result of the marriage ending."
866,CHILD SUPPORT [12] Mr. Rhyno is required to pay child support for the three children in Ms. Guy’s care based on the federal Child Support Guidelines.,"The wife sought a divorce, custody, child support, a division of matrimonial assets and an order directing that the husband's equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child reached 19 years of age.
She proposed to sell the home and put the proceeds, together with a new mortgage, towards the purchase of a new home.
Joint custody awarded for all four children, with the father to have primary care and control of the oldest and the mother to have primary care and control of the three younger children; the father is to pay child support for three children in the guideline amount and the mother is to pay child support for one child in the guideline amount; the husband's equity in the matrimonial home is frozen at the amount owing on the mortgage when the parties separated and his interest is postponed until the youngest child reaches the age of 21 years; if the wife wishes to obtain a new home in a new location, she will be required to pay out the husband's equity in the matrimonial home."
867,"2. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in law and in fact in varying the Consent Order dated April 26, 2001 and in finding that James Davis, at the time of attaining the age of nineteen (June 2, 2001), had not withdrawn and was unable to withdraw from the charge of his parents because it was his intention at that time and continued to be his intention to further his education at post‑secondary institution?","The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday.
He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity.
The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father.
The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program.
The father appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident.
There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order."
868,"On appeal, the appellant says that his conviction is miscarriage of justice because the trial judge based her rejection of his testimony on material misapprehensions of the evidence. As noted, the judge found inconsistency between the appellant’s evidence that he spent three or four hours day in the children’s home and his evidence that he asked never to be left alone with them because he was afraid of being charged with sexual offence.","The appellant was convicted of sexual assault.
The court disbelieved his evidence, principally because it was found to be internally inconsistent.
The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food.
There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly.
The appellant appealed.
Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered.
The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic.
The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment.
The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice."
869,"At paragraph Hamilton J.A. states as follows: “I considered if this Rule authorizes me to issue summary judgment limited only to liability for the accident itself and not causation, because of its use of the words ""a part thereof"", but on reading the whole of Civil Procedure Rule 13.01, am satisfied that it means that summary judgment is not to be granted when there is any issue other than the amount of damages still in issue between the parties, which interpret to only be the case after causation has been determined as part of the summary judgment application.” [14] am satisfied upon reading the reports of Doctor Steve Crosby and Doctor Douglas Watt attached as appendix and to the plaintiff’s affidavit that the causation of certain amount of her physical injuries resulted from the accident.","The plaintiff, who was injured in a rear-end motor vehicle accident, applied for summary judgment and an interim payment of damages.
Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed.
There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle.
The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess.
The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages."
870,"(1) If the provincial director has reasonable grounds to believe that young person has breached or is about to breach condition to which he or she is subject under section 97 (conditions to be included in custody and supervision orders), the provincial director may, in writing, (a) permit the young person to continue to serve portion of his or her youth sentence in the community, on the same or different conditions; or (b) if satisfied that the breach is serious one that increases the risk to public safety, order that the young person be remanded to any youth custody facility that the provincial director considers appropriate until review is conducted. (1) When the case of young person is referred to the youth justice court under section 108 (review by provincial director), the provincial director shall, without delay, cause the young person to be brought before the youth justice court, and the youth justice court shall, after giving the young person an opportunity to be heard, (a) if the court is not satisfied on reasonable grounds that the young person has breached or was about to breach one of the conditions under which he or she was being supervised in the community, order that the young person continue to serve portion of his or her youth sentence in the community, on the same or different conditions; or (b) if the court is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the young person has breached or was about to breach one of the conditions under which he or she was being supervised in the community, make an order under subsection (2).","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order.
The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later.
His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act.
The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired.
She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order.
The Crown appeals the decision.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act.
On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended.
2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large.
Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision.
The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted.
Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b).
Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern.
There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision.
That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102.
This means two things.
First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person.
Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3)
The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself."
871,[2] After calling several times to determine the market price for flax the defendant agreed to sell to the plaintiff 300 metric tonnes of flax at a net price of $264.65 per tonne. The defendant had previously delivered to the plaintiff’s elevator 2.043 tonnes of flax which were applied to the contract leaving 297.957 tonnes undelivered.,"The plaintiff is in the business of buying and selling grain.
The defendant is a farmer.
After calling the plaintiff several times to determine the market price for flax, the defendant agreed to sell the plaintiff 300 metric tonnes of flax of which 297.957 tonnes remain undelivered.
HELD: 1) The defendant did not deliver the balance of the flax before August, 2001 or at anytime and he is in breach of the contract.
2) The verbal contract was in force from the time of the telephone conversation ended in June 2001.
As the price rose, the plaintiff would have profited by $36.50 per tonne.
That is the loss of profit that the plaintiff's claim is based on multiplied by 297.957 and totals $10,875.43.
3) The part performance involving the sale under the contract of 2.043 tonnes is sufficient to meet the requirements of The Sale of Goods Act."

HELD: Whether or not the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction and consequently are a nullity, the applicant has an adequate alternative remedy available to him.
No special circumstances that might justify judicial intervention at this time have been presented.

The claim is based on the allegation that the plaintiff loaned the defendant Kelly $69,000.
The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month.
HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed.
The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan.
However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made.
In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly.
The only discussion she seems to have had was with her husband after which she wrote a cheque to the defendant."
875,"v. Morris, 1998 CanLII 1344 (NS CA), [1998] N.S.J. No. 492 (C.A.), Cromwell, J.A. of this court provided the following guidance: 30 Without attempting to be exhaustive, it might be helpful to summarize, briefly, the key elements of what must be shown to establish this ""credibly based probability"": (i) The Information to obtain the warrant must set out sworn evidence sufficient to establish reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been committed, that the things to be searched for will afford evidence and that the things in question will be found at specified place: (R.","The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence.
Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence.
The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test.
The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion.
Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration.
The Crown appealed.
Appeal allowed; new trial ordered.
Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it.
By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences."
876,"In an oral decision at the conclusion of the hearing Justice Scanlan ordered, among other things, that the matrimonial home be put up for immediate sale; that Mr. Goyetche continue to pay Mrs. Goyetche $800.00 per month in spousal support terminating on June 1, 2006; that Mrs. Goyetche immediately return to Mr. Goyetche certain personal belongings; that Mr. Goyetche continue to pay the monthly mortgage payments on the matrimonial home, with all such payments made after June 28, 2005 credited to him from the sale proceeds of the home; and that the equity in the matrimonial home would be divided equally between the parties after first deducting legal fees and real estate commission. [11] The documentation and testimony at the hearing make it plain that three simple matters drove Mr. Goyetche’s application: first, he wanted to stop paying support to his wife; second, he wanted his name “off” the mortgage on the matrimonial home so that he could then finance his acquisition of new residence for himself; and finally, he wanted returned his surround sound stereo system and certain valuable collector’s items, including an antique knife and an autographed Mickey Mantle baseball.","In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home.
The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses.
The wife appealed.
Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home;
the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice.
There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value."
877,"[1] This is an action by the plaintiffs, Cathy Hawes and Aulden Pottie, for damages suffered as a result of a motor vehicle accident which occurred on November 23, 1998 at the intersections of Forrest Hills Drive and Main Street in the Dartmouth area of Halifax Regional Municipality. He was asked whether the headlights of the Hawes motor vehicle were on at the time of the accident and he said “absolutely.” He was asked how he knew that and he stated that when Ms. Hawes was backing out of her parking spot at their last stop she “blinded” the people in the vehicle operated by Mr. Leckie.","The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night.
Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation.
The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand.
She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back.
The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg.
He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy.
General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt).
The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it.
The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact."
878,"(1) justice who is satisfied by information on oath in Form that there are reasonable grounds to believe that there is in building, receptacle or place (a) anything on or in respect of which any offence against this Act or any other Act of Parliament has been or is suspected to have been committed, (b) anything that there are reasonable grounds to believe will afford evidence with respect to the commission of an offence, or will reveal the whereabouts of person who is believed to have committed an offence, against this Act or any other Act of Parliament, (c) anything that there are reasonable grounds to believe is intended to be used for the purpose of committing any offence against the person for which person may be arrested without warrant, or (c.1) any offence‑related property, may at any time issue warrant authorizing peace officer or public officer who has been appointed or designated to administer or enforce federal or provincial law and whose duties include the enforcement of this Act or any other Act of Parliament and who is named in the warrant (d) to search the building, receptacle or place for any such thing and to seize it, and (e) subject to any other Act of Parliament, to, as soon as practicable, bring the thing seized before, or make report in respect thereof to, the justice or some other justice for the same territorial division in accordance with section 489.1.","The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period.
The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales.
Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies.
The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties.
Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance;
there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice.
The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file.
There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias."

The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children.
Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices.
The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence.
Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother;
until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent.
Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors."

It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met.
The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender.
This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel.
HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender.
He is sentenced to indeterminate detention.
1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000.
While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour.
2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.
 3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances.
4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person.
Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face.
Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time.
It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk.
5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence."
881,"THE APPLICABLE LAW [67] In the case of Hayley, whose parents lived in spousal relationship for the first two years of the child’s life, the relevant law is found in The Children’s Law Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c. In making, varying or rescinding an order for custody of child, the court shall: (a) have regard only for the best interests of the child and for that purpose shall take into account: (i) the quality of the relationship that the child has with the person who is seeking custody and any other person who may have close connection with the child; (ii) the personality, character and emotional needs of the child; (iii) the physical, psychological, social and economic needs of the child; (iv) the capacity of the person who is seeking custody to act as legal custodian of the child; (v) the home environment proposed to be provided for the child; (vi) the plans that the person who is seeking custody has for the future of the child; and (vii) the wishes of the child, to the extent the court considers appropriate, having regard to the age and maturity of the child; (b) not take into consideration the past conduct of any person unless the conduct is relevant to the ability of that person to act as parent of child; and (c) make no presumption and draw no inference as between parents that one parent should be preferred over the other on the basis of the person’s status as father or mother. J. O.’s independent right of access to Hayley should not be so extensive that, when coupled with C.","Hayley is 7 years old.
In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her.
The father seeks sole custody.
The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father.
The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver.
HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years.
The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father.
2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found.
3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley.
He must consult with her mother.
The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship.
Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4)
A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated.
That is the first step.
The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest.
It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act.
5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful.
There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to.
An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests.
The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access."
882,"deal with a claim for aggravated and punitive or exemplary damages.]; (iii) in the alternative, an order pursuant to Rule 164(4)of The Queen’s Bench Rules requiring the plaintiffs to provide particulars of their claim for aggravated and punitive damages as set out in the Demand for Particulars dated November 25, 2005; (iv) an order pursuant to Rule 231 of The Queen’s Bench Rules requiring the plaintiffs to respond to undertakings number 37, 42, 43, 46 and 52 given at the examination for discovery of the plaintiff, Mark Baert; (v) an order entitling the defendant, Kenneth Graham, to further examine the plaintiff, Mark Baert, on responses given to the undertakings; (vi) an order that failing the providing of responses the plaintiffs’ action be dismissed without further application.","FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery.
The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery.
HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue.
If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value.
At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons.
Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals.
Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged.
Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories.
Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings.
The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency.
The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories.
If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor.
Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.
 2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action.
Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency.
Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence.
The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages.
The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages.
It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages.
The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved.
Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor.
It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor.
In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded.
If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3)
The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules.
To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered.
If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided.
4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff.
However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff."
883,"v. Legrow, [2007] N.S.J. No. 11 (S.C.) in which it was held that risk of change of mind was relevant consideration in deciding whether or not an accused who had rebutted the presumption was nevertheless in care or control of his motor vehicle for purposes of s.","The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit.
The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in.
The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house.
Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged.
From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a).
Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public."
884,"[29] In R.v. Pritchett, [1995] O.J. No. 3277, hearsay statement was allowed into evidence based on the following indicia of reliability: the complainant made an unexpected visit to her friend, she had no motive to lie, she was upset and crying, she had physical mark consistent with an assault, and she stated that the accused had punched her. Conclusion [31] The following circumstances are evidence supportive of the trustworthiness of the statements made by [A.G.] on September 26, 2006:  (i) she arrived unexpectedly at her neighbour’s apartment, around 11:30 at night;  (ii) she was upset and crying;  (iii) she asked that the police be called;  (iv) she spontaneously described and demonstrated the incident which brought her to her neighbours and prompted the report to the police;  (v) she repeated a consistent version to the police;  (vi) she had fresh red marks on her neck and chest, which corresponded with her description;  (vii) she reported that the incident began with a quarrel about a bank card;  (viii) the accused verified this aspect of her complaint with his comments about the bank card;  (ix) a bank card in the name of [A.G.] was found in the possession of the accused; and    (x) the evidence supports the inference that the complainant and the accused were alone in their apartment from the time Ms.","The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.
The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents.
HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.
 1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity.
A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source.
2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence.
Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage.
Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application.
The test of necessity has been met.
 3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping.
Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met.
The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made."
885,"(c) The Application for Claim under the Act dated September 1, 2006 sets out the following persons as tenants: “Vern Richie Andres” and “Ivy Andres.” The Landlord’s application is claiming an order for possession based on Notice to Terminate Lease.","This is an appeal by the landlord pursuant to s. 49 of The Residential Tenancies Act from a decision of the Deputy Rentalsman who, pursuant to s. 47 of the Act dismissed an application by the landlord for a writ of possession.
HELD: The matter will be remitted to the Rentalsman for a rehearing upon proof of service of the Notice of Hearing on all of the tenants.
 1) The tenants who are named in the decision are Vernon and Ivy.
There is no reference to Richie whose name appears on the tenancy agreement.
2) Even though the decision states that the Notice of Hearing was properly served, that cannot be the end of the matter given that there is nothing in the file which would indicate any directions having been given to the landlord with respect to service other than personal service.
Ivy and Richie did not appear at the hearing and the decision does not even identify Richie as being one of the tenants.
More is required to ensure service of and notice to all the tenants.
3) There are no notes nor is there anything in the decision which would permit the Court to conclude that the issue of service on Ivy and Richie was ever considered by the Rentalsman.
The matter must be returned to the Rentalsman for a rehearing upon proof of service of the hearing on all of the tenants."
886,"In the matter before me, find am unable to make spousal support order because the father does not have necessary resources to pay monthly sum to the mother once he has satisfied his child support obligations.","FIAT: The primary issue is whether the father should pay for tutoring expenses.
HELD: 1)
The father is not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance.
However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive.
The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer.
It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program.
On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody.
The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments.
If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month.
The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month.
Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.
 2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3)
The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400."
887,"2. The learned Provincial Court judge who issued the authorization did so in error because there was no basis upon which he could conclude that there were reasonable grounds to believe that information concerning the offences would be obtained through the interception sought and, therefore, the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. That affidavit states that if the authorization to intercept private communications is granted, the police intend to have the complainant initiate communication with the accused regarding their alleged sexual activity in anticipation of eliciting responses from the accused that would provide evidence concerning the alleged offences.","This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant.
Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2).
The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code.
HELD: The evidence is admissible.
The accused's application is dismissed.
1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant.
The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship.
The conversation is logically probative to the charge.
2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization.
The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations.
3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code.
That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained.
The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization.
The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered.
Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code.
During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code.
The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence.
Therefore, there is no Charter breach.
4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence.
Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.
The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion.
In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship.
There is no evidence of bad faith.
There is no evidence of manipulation.
The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute."
888,20 of The Limitations Act applies and requires the plaintiffs to obtain leave to amend the claim by adding Saskatchewan as a new party.,"FIAT: The plaintiffs are former students of a school at Ile a La Crosse, Saskatchewan.
They commenced this proposed class action against the Attorney General of Canada (the Government) in December 2005.
In January 2007 the plaintiffs' counsel filed an amended statement of claim which added the Government of Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan) as a second defendant.
Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim.
The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents.
HELD: 1) This application is based on the proposition that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applies to the plaintiffs' amended claim.
However, s. 20 does not apply because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant.
Section 19 of The Limitations Act applies to the original and the amended claims.
The application is dismissed.
2) Accepting the pleadings as true, a number of the plaintiffs' claims are prima facie statute-barred.
The plaintiff may choose to apply for orders determining that no time limitation period applies or allowing the claims to be brought.
Alternatively, the defendants may apply for orders determining that some or all of the claims are statute-barred.
In either case, the applications must satisfy the applicable legislation and the Rules of Court."
889,"Ms. Walper-Bossence deposed that the testator then repeated what Barry Shade had said about Yvonne Tyler. [24] Mr. Shade deposed the following about the meeting between the testator, himself and Ms. Walper-Bossence: 46 The matter of the Power of Attorney was obviously one that weighed heavily on Uncle Roland’s mind because when he met with Ms. Walper-Bossence, Q.C., on October 19, 2005, at the conclusion of the interview where he gave instructions for his new Will Ms. Walper-Bossence, Q.C., asked him if there “anything else Roland” and he replied “well about the Power of Attorney”.","The applicant asks that the Will be proven in solemn form to determine whether there was undue influence on the testator.
HELD: The evidence from the lawyer who prepared the Testator's last Will was that she was concerned that the testator was being influenced.
The evidence from the executor of the Estate raises no such concerns.
Based on the evidence, the conflict in the evidence and the law, the issue of undue influence cannot be resolved without a trial of the issue.
A trial is ordered."
890,"Once notice of the hearing has been given, the court is entitled to dispense with the birth parent’s consent, if s/he fails to appear at the hearing, or in any event: 74(3) Where the person proposed to be adopted is under the age of majority and is not child in care, no order for the child's adoption shall be made, except as herein provided, without the written consent to adoption of the child's parents which consent may not be revoked unless the court is satisfied that the revocation is in the best interests of the child.","The appellant appealed the adoption order regarding her natural child.
Although at one time the child had been in the permanent care of the Agency, that order was terminated and replaced by a private guardianship order which had placed the child with the now-adoptive parents.
Although neither of the birth parents, who resided in British Columbia, had attended the adoption hearing, the birth mother now sought access to the child and requested that the court receive fresh evidence as to her unsuccessful efforts to obtain counsel to represent her at the adoption hearing.
Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence.
The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so.
Allowing the appeal would be in the child's best interests as she had resided with the adoptive parents for the past three years and would continue to do so pending the further hearing."
891,"As such, the Applicants believe that the Estate should commence an action in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against Marine Atlantic Inc. and the Respondent for payment into the Estate of the pension plan entitlement earned by the Intestate, and for reimbursement by the Respondent of the amounts already paid to her.","The intestate's biological child, who was one of the personal representatives of the estate, wished to sue the intestate's former employer to have the pension to which he was entitled at the time of his death paid into the estate.
The other personal representative of the estate, who was the intestate's spouse, was in receipt of survivor benefits under the pension and, as such, was opposed to the intended court action.
The biological child applied to have his stepmother removed as a personal representative of the estate.
Application dismissed;
the removal of the personal representative would only be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate if the intended lawsuit was feasible, which it was not.
The estate was bound by the terms of the pension plan, which provided that the respondent was clearly entitled, as the spouse of the intestate, to survivor benefits and the payment of a lump sum into her estate if she died within five years of the intestate's retirement."
892,"[1] The Minister of Social Services applied for leave to appeal an order of Gabrielson J., sitting on appeal from an order of Meekma P.C.J., in relation to the child K.W. dismissed the application from the bench following oral argument for the following reasons. That the judge on appeal erred in ordering on concurrent basis that K.W. be returned to his father and also that the minister retain custody of K.W. on temporary basis, contrary to subsections 37(1) and 38(9) of The Child and Family Services Act. 2.","The Minister of Social Services applied for leave to appeal an order of Gabrielson J., sitting on appeal from an order of Meekma P.C.J. in relation to the child K.W.
Gabrielson J. made an order returning K.W. to its parent's custody with a period of transition after receiving a psychological report on R.S.
The report was very favourable to R.S. The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report.
HELD: Leave denied.
Even if there was a scintilla of merit to the argument, the Court would not grant leave to appeal on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on an extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case.
The issue is not of sufficient significance either to the parties or to the wider public to warrant an appeal."
893,"Slone, Adjudicator Hearing held at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia on September 29, 2009 Provisional decision rendered on September 30, 2009; Addendum added October 20, 2009 APPEARANCES For the Landlord Jim Lorimer, President For the Tenant self-represented BY THE COURT: [1] This case raises an interesting and perhaps important issue under residential tenancy law, and in particular what it means when Landlord has been directed not to withhold consent in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner.","The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31.
Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy.
The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st.
The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families.
It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students.
The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months.
After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful.
The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable.
The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty.
The officer erred in law.
The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably.
The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy.
There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld.
The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31).
Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place."
894,"H. is the mother of two children, N.S. and D.S. N.O.S. is the father of the children. [3] H.H., the mother, is not seeking a return of the children to her directly but supports the position of N.O.S., the father, who asks that the children be returned to him in his care.","The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old.
DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born.
Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007.
Both children have been in care for most of their lives.
The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children.
The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care.
HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society.
Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement.
2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management.
The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH.
The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour.
There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future.
There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past.
The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal.
There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past.
The Court finds that the relationship is unstable.
The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship.
The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control.
There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic.
This should not be visited on the children.
HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS.
The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court.
This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3)
If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm.
While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS.
The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours.
The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so.
The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH.
4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order.
A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time.
The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them."
895,"The issues can be described as follows: a) whether plaintiffs’ counsel, Merchant Law Group, (MLG) should be granted leave pursuit to Rule 317 to cross examine Sarah Moore on her affidavit sworn June 24, 2009; b) whether MLG should be granted an order requiring Red Seal to serve pre-certification notices to all persons who travelled with Red Seal during the purposed class; c) whether MLG is entitled to demand, prior to the hearing of the certification motion, that Red Seal provide MLG with list of names and addresses of all persons who travelled with Red Seal during the proposed class; d) should there be compliance with Rule 82(6) and Rule 82(7) of the Saskatchewan Queen’s Bench Rules of Court; e) costs of these two applications ANALYSIS OF ISSUES 5) a) whether plaintiffs’ counsel, Merchant Law Group, (MLG) should be granted leave pursuit to Rule 317 to cross examine Sarah Moore on her affidavit sworn June 24, 2009; 6) It is important to review how the Moore affidavit came to be.","Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated.
HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.
 1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant.
This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals.
The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue.
This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on.
The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do.
There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit.
In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed.
There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.
 2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients.
The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members.
However, that case is not similar to this case.
In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements.
Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's.
The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.'
As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act.
Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction."
896,"(2) Subject to sections 139 and 140, the income replacement benefit of full-time earner or of victim for whom the insurer determines an employment pursuant to section 131, 132, or 133 is to be not less than the amount of an income replacement benefit calculated on the basis of gross yearly employment income determined on the basis of: (a) the minimum wage established pursuant to The Labour Standards Act; and (b) except in the case of part-time employment, the number of hours of work per week set out in subsection 6(1) of The Labour Standards Act.","At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI.
The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75.
The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act.
HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB.
It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners.
It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners.
All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident.
The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality."
897,"I order Richard to pay Shelley $300.00 per month on the first day of each month commencing April 1, 2008 to and including March 1, 2009 based on his income of $30,000;00. ordered that the appellant pay the respondent spousal support of $600.00 per month.","The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year.
The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation.
They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant.
Both parties have some health problems.
Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year.
Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible.
The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment.
She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica.
She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced.
HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside.
The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage.
He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment.
The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant.
He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student.
It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient.
The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge."
898,"1. Has the petitioner established material change of circumstances since the parenting judgment or the child support order of February 2, 2007? That, in my opinion, is not a material change of circumstance as the change of the petitioner’s income on equal parenting were clearly provided for in the original child support order and parenting judgment.","The petitioner and respondent are the parents of twins.
The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order.
The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent.
The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner.
The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children.
For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time.
The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children.
The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis.
The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come.
The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children.
HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement.
The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children.
The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement.
The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order.
The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased.
The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed.
The respondent was awarded costs."

The landlord's appeal relates to the Hearing Officer's finding of facts related to the tenant’s claim for reimbursement of one-half of the utilities.,"The applicant landlord appeals from a decision of the hearing officer of the Residential Tenancies Office, which ordered the landlord to pay the tenant $787.13.
Of this amount, $562.13 represents utilities that the tenant had overpaid.
The landlord states that he never agreed to pay the utilities.HELD: Pursuant to s. 72 of The residential Tenancies Act, the court is restricted to addressing questions of law or jurisdiction.
The landlord's appeal relates to findings of fact made by the hearing officer.
There was evidence to support the hearing officer's factual decision and all of her findings.
It is not open to this court to overturn those findings of fact.
The appeal is dismissed."
900,"[2] The defendant submits that the young persons, JP and JR, now in Grade 9, were victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted by senior students, including the plaintiffs, and that public disclosure of information in their affidavits would exacerbate the harm which has been done to them.","The defendant applied for an order sealing the affidavits of two young people who were the victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted at a high school by senior students, including the plaintiffs.
The defendant argued that public disclosure of the affidavits would exacerbate the harm that was done to the young people.
The Leader-Post was granted leave to speak to the matter and opposed the application.
HELD: Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine, particularly in an electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the young persons in their affidavits will not cause further harm to them.
The public, including fellow students, have the right to know their version of the facts.
However, other portions of the affidavits that refer to the effects of the assault on the young men and their ramifications to others should be sealed because there is a real risk of further harm to the young persons and to others."
901,"About week after the conclusion of the trial, but before rendered my decision the petitioner revoked his offer. The sanction so to speak of not accepting a reasonable offer properly tendered and proceeding to trial is found in Rule 184B of the Queen’s Bench Rules of Court.","Supplementary reasons to 2010 SKQB 439.
The petitioner served the respondent with a formal offer of settlement on September 14, 2010.
The offer was not accepted and the matter proceeded to trial.
A week after the trial was concluded and while the decision was reserved, the offer was revoked.
The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B.
HELD: Queen's Bench Rule 184B calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer.
The fact the offer was revoked does not alter the concept in Rule 184B and the resulting sanction.
The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3 up to September 14, 2010 and double party of party costs under Column 3 thereafter, together with the costs for this application.
All costs were payable forthwith."

HELD: Rather than filing an appeal, the respondent should have pursued a remedy in Queen's Bench.
The proper procedure would have been to apply under Queen's Bench Rule 271 to have the matter opened up and disposed of on the basis of the evidence.
The matter was adjourned sine die with leave to bring the matter back to Court if the appellant is unsuccessful at Queen's Bench."
903,"There had been nobody else but the complainant and the accused in the bedroom at the time. [20] The complainant had claimed in her evidence that, as she tried to close the door to the bedroom, the accused had forced his way in, pushing her down on the floor with both hands on her chest, she striking her head.","The accused was charged with committing a common assault against his step-sister being the complainant.
The question was whether the Crown's evidence was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant and whether the Crown was able to prove non-consent beyond a reasonable doubt.
HELD: The Court did not know whom to believe and the accused was acquitted."
904,"The accused in MacLaren indicated he did not have lawyer, so the officer dialled the number for Legal Aid. The Court found that the accused was not given reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel. v. McCrimmon, 2010 SCC 36 (CanLII), [2010] S.C.R. 402, the Court held that where an accused expressed preference for speaking with particular lawyer, the police acted properly in inquiring whether he wanted to contact Legal Aid instead, when the preferred counsel was not available.","The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident.
The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m.
Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m.
The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel.
The accused was charged with driving over .08.
The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained.
The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis.
HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed.
While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made.
2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged.
The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised.
The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute."
905,"[10] The trial judge held first that “there is no evidence that the Accused either used or intended to use the sword for the purposes enumerated in the definition; namely: (a) in causing death or injury to any person, or (b) for the purpose of threatening or intimidating any person.” In making this determination, she relied on the accused’s evidence that he had just purchased the sword and was taking it home to display in his room, or on his television. There was evidence upon which she could conclude that the Crown had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to use the sword as a weapon, or that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon.
The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants.
At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge.
The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television.
The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon.
The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence.
HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience.
No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge.
The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store.
On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon.
The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed.
The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon.
The Crown appeal was dismissed."
906,"In appeal court Chambers on July 28, Justice Beveridge directed Ms. Cummings to file an amended notice of appeal naming only Her Majesty the Queen and Judge Stroud as respondents, to make motion for date and directions once Justice Coughlan’s order was issued and to give notice of any further proceedings to the AGNS and the Public Prosecution Service.",",  motions granted.
Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so.
While a dismissal of the criminal appeal is a serious remedy, since it means it will never be heard on its merits, the appellant has made it clear that she cannot provide certified transcripts unless the court orders the respondents to pay.
The court has already declined to do so.
There is no suggestion a further extension of time will result in the appellant perfecting the appeal."
907,"Larry Salsman Respondent LIBRARY HEADING Judge: The Honourable Justice Frank Edwards Heard: March 29, 2012 in Halifax, Nova Scotia Written Release of April 5, 2012 Oral Decision: Subject: Motion for Interim Injunction CPR 41.04 Facts: 30 year employee of Plaintiff Company resigns to open competing business.","The applicant is the only drug store in a rural community.
The respondent worked there for 30 years, in various positions.
He signed a 5-year, 10 mile non-competition clause in 1995.
He quit in early March with the intention of opening a new drug store down the street in early April.
Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store.
The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction.
Interim injunction granted.
The new Civil Procedure Rules (2008) distinguish between interim and interlocutory injunctions.
This is one of the circumstances which was contemplated when the new Rule 41.04 was enacted.
Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait.
While the non-competition clause may well not survive a challenge at the full hearing of the interlocutory injunction motion, all the applicant needs to show is that there is a serious issue to be tried.
There is.
This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application.
There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community.
An interim injunction will only result in a delay of a few weeks.
The interlocutory injunction is set to heard at the end of April.
The stakes are higher for the applicant than they are for the respondent."
908,"The latter section speaks directly to the circumstances where an offender has been previously convicted of designated offence: (3) Order if previous offence established When court imposes sentence on person for designated offence in connection with which an order may be made under subsection (1) or (2) or renders verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder for such an offence, it shall, on application of the prosecutor, make an order in Form 52 requiring the person to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for the applicable period specified in section 490.013 if the prosecutor establishes that (a) the person was, before or after the coming into force of this paragraph, previously convicted of, or found not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder for, an offence referred to in paragraph (a), (c), (c.1), (d) or (e) of the definition “designated offence” in subsection 490.011(1) or in paragraph (a) or (c) of the definition “designated offence” in section 227 of the National Defence Act; [Emphasis added.] [7] Put simply, if Parliament had intended the narrow application of s.","The accused was convicted of four counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code.
The Crown had proceeded by indictment and the accused was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 8 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year Sexual Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) compliance order.
At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order.
If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3).
Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who committed multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or altogether."
909,"48, lines 1-8) [15] Cst. Forrester testified that this was the first opportunity to make notes as when she was at the location of the arrest with the appellant in the police vehicle, she was writing up and completing the notice of impoundment of the appellant’s vehicle and did not get an opportunity to complete her notes until she was at the police station at 12:29 a.m. DECISION OF THE TRIAL JUDGE [16] The trial judge said at page 99, lines 16 the following, finding that Cst. Forrester had reasonable and probable grounds to make demand: THE COURT: Madam, with the greatest of respect, dealing firstly with reasonable and probable grounds, the law is very clear that you don’t examine indicia individually and with fine tooth comb. [22] The appellant argues that the trial judge failed to consider Cst. Forrester’s own testimony that she was not certain if she had reasonable and probable grounds to make demand for breath sample only minutes before she made the demand.","The appellant was convicted of driving over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code.
The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts.
The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes.
The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath."
910,"[4] The defendants maintain that by reason of Rule 15, the service and filing of a notice of appeal stays the execution of a judgment until disposition of the appeal, unless otherwise ordered.","In the original judgment, the manner in which certain calculations should be made with respect to the amount owing to the plaintiff was left to the parties, with the provision that the judge remained seized if they could not reach an agreement.
After judgment, the defendants appealed the judgment.
 The plaintiffs then submitted detailed calculations of the final judgment for the trial judge's review.
The defendants objected to the finalization of the judgment on the ground that, pursuant to Court of Appeal Rule 15, the notice of appeal had stayed the execution of the judgment until the disposition of the appeal.
The plaintiff submitted that the calculation of the judgment was not acting on it.
HELD: The defendant misconstrued the scope of Rule 15 as it does not stay proceedings.
The appeal does not affect the ability of the Court to finalize the judgment.
In fact, to do so will avoid costs and delay, and will hopefully be of some of assistance to the Court of Appeal."
911,"[36] In addition to the reports and testimony of Dr. Mela and Dr. Arnold, the trial judge considered written reports from the Saskatoon Correctional Centre, including evidence of staff relating to the behaviour of Mr. Gonzales and to the treatment and programming available. [42] The trial judge, after consideration of all of the evidence, did not share the experts’ underlying assumptions that Mr. Gonzales is willing to take treatment, especially as it relates to reducing his high risk to reoffend sexually.","The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence.
The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts.
Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment.
Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate.
Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar.
Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change.
In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody.
He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper.
The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence.
The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions.
In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone.
In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal."
912,"[55] Nowhere in the trial judge’s reasons does he mention that: (i) the second step of the grievance process had intervened between the preparation of the Grievance Report and the Notice re: Harassment Grievance; (ii) notwithstanding the University’s strong objections to the publication that had taken place in the Hospital, the Union proceeded to wider publication by means of mail-out to its members and posting on the website; and (iii) the newsletter remained available on the internet until lawsuit was commenced.","The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249).
The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee.
The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000.
The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000.
The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs.
HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied.
Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion.
In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice.
It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal.
The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege.
The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000.
It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law.
The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case.
The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer.
The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed.
The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant.
An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice.
The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs.
However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed."
913,"[28] Finally, MLG says the Administrative Judge erred in failing to require Deloitte to complete its report and then requiring Canada to deliver the report to MLG; further erred in concluding MLG had not complied with the February 8, 2012 order by delivering the redacted electronic billing records to Canada; and finally, erred by failing to conclude the process set out in para.","The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers.
The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants.
The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements.
In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed.
When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate.
The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement.
They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions.
The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program.
Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees.
Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them.
Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority.
In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan.
Leave to appeal was denied.
The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable.
The prospective appellant failed to establish that there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings or to the field of practice, the state of law or the administration of justice to warrant a determination by the Court."
914,"[45] It was clear in the evidence of all parties that John was unhappy about Lilia being asked to work less hours by her doctor, and that one of the reasons that Christos and as well Lilia were dismissed was that Christos had wanted documentation, being Lilia’s Record of Employment in order to file for maternity leave.","HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff.
The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000.
There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation.
The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim.
The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift.
The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven;
there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent.
The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out.
The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim.
The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement.
The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s.
The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32.
The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance.
The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance."
915,"[15] Sections 38(2)(a) to (d) give general guidance to sentencing Court as follows: (2) youth justice court that imposes youth sentence on young person shall determine the sentence in accordance with the principles set out in section and the following principles: (a) the sentence must not result in punishment that is greater than the punishment that would be appropriate for an adult who has been convicted of the same offence committed in similar circumstances; (b) the sentence must be similar to the sentences imposed in the region on similar young persons found guilty of the same offence committed in similar circumstances; (c) the sentence must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the young person for that offence; (d) all available sanctions other than custody that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all young persons, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal young persons. The terms are the following: a) Keep the peace and be of good behaviour; b) Appear before the Youth Justice Court when required by the Court to do so; c) Report to the Youth Worker at La Ronge Youth Workers immediately upon release and thereafter be under the supervision of the Youth Court Worker, or person designated by the Youth Justice Court; d) Inform the Court Worker immediately upon being arrested by the police; e) Report to the police or any named individual as instructed by the Youth Worker; f) Inform the clerk of the Youth Justice Court or the Youth Worker of your residential address on release, and after release, report immediately to the Youth Worker any: i) Change in that address; ii) Change in your normal occupation, including employment, vocational or educational training and volunteer work; iii) Change in your family and financial situation; iv) Change that may reasonably be expected to affect your ability to comply with the conditions of the Order; g) Must not own, possess, or have the control of any weapon, ammunition, prohibited ammunition, prohibited device, or explosive substance; h) Comply with such reasonable instructions as the Youth Worker considers necessary in respect of any condition of the conditional supervision order to prevent breach of that condition or order, protect society and in addition: i) Report to the Youth Worker forthwith and be under the supervision of the Youth Worker; ii) Reside at residence specified of and in writing by the Youth Worker and do not change that residence without the prior written permission of the Youth Worker or the Court; iii) Not possess or consume any controlled substances as defined by the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, except as prescribed by medical doctor; and iv) Not possess cell phone during the period of your deferred custody.","The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation.
The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act.
HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody.
The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain.
The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province.
The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender."
916,"The affidavits of Luciana Brasil, Jonathan Bancroft-Snell and Amy Habicht have been filed in support of the application for orders staying the MLG Action and granting the Consortium carriage of the claims against the defendants.","HELD: The Court dismissed the application.
The information contained in the affidavits was uncontroverted and a matter of public record.
MLG was unable to explain how cross-examination would assist the Court.
As well, the application to cross-examine did not appear to rest on a real need to clarify any issues relevant to the application for which the affidavits had been filed and focused on the relative merits of legal issues rather than on evidentiary issues."
917,[12] In its responses to undertakings 28 and 39 Clarke replied that answers to these undertakings cannot be provided until completion of its own questioning of CN and takes the position that CN’s application in respect of these undertakings is premature and unnecessary.,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable.
The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue.
This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules.
The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses.
With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled.
Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits.
The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it.
It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so.
The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied.
The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege.
Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature.
The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one.
Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with.
The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers."
918,"Upon careful consideration of the evidence and application of the principles in the cases set out above, the court is of the view that the children’s best interests are best served by the mother remaining the primary parent, and that this be done in Kenaston. [35] While personal access to an incarcerated parent may be beneficial to children in some instances in this case the court has insufficient evidence to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that these two young children visiting their father in jail would benefit.","The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant.
She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse.
The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year.
The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail.
The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order.
One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner.
HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis.
The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances.
The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour.
The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release.
This is not a realistic option.
It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial.
With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children.
The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time."
919,"In written decision dated August 20, 2012 (2012 SKPC 132 (CanLII), 403 Sask.R. 171), the Provincial Court judge (Whelan, P.C.J.) held that: (1) there was structural defect in the north basement wall of the house during the time that the Richardsons owned the house; (2) the Richardsons were aware of the seriousness of the defect; (3) the statements made by the Richardsons in the disclosure statement were misleading, and had been relied upon by Hancock to his detriment; (4) in covering the old retaining wall with new interior wall, the Richardsons had converted what was patent defect or one that was readily discoverable into latent defect; (5) the disclosure statement amounted to negligent misrepresentation; and (6) damages in the amount of $18,006.74 together with interest pursuant to The Pre-judgment Interest Act, S.S. 1984-85-86, c. [26] Counsel for the Richardsons submitted that notwithstanding that the trial judge only found that the wooden beam was rotten and observable as such, that she awarded damages for all of Hancock’s losses, including the cost of repair of the cement foundation.","The appellants appealed a small claims judgment.
The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement.
When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one.
He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall.
The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced.
The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair.
The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair.
Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam.
The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did.
The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state.
The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it.
The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation.
The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up.
The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made.
In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation."
920,"[9] Section of The Court of Appeal Act of 1978, and its predecessors dating back to The Court of Appeal Act, SS 1915, 9, grounded its jurisdiction in that of the High Court of Justice or the Court of Appeals in England as of January 1, 1898, “where not specially changed, altered or provided for” by any enactment of the legislature: Nature and extent of jurisdiction The court shall have all the jurisdiction and powers possessed by the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan en banc immediately prior to the first day of March, 1918, and shall have jurisdiction and power, subject to the rules of court, to hear and determine all applications for new trials, all questions or issues of law, all questions or points reserved for the opinion of the court, all appeals or motions in the nature of appeals respecting any judgment, order or decision of any judge of the Court of Queen’s Bench, or respecting any judgment or decision of any judge of court of inferior jurisdiction, sitting in court, where an appeal is given by any Act, all petitions, and all other motions, matters or things whatsoever which might lawfully be brought before any divisional court of the High Court of Justice or the Court of Appeals in England on the first day of January, 1898, where not specially changed, altered or provided for by this or any other Act of Saskatchewan.","HELD: The court dismissed the application.
Section 7(2) indicates that whenever the legislature confers jurisdiction on the Court of Queen’s Bench, and is silent with respect to an appeal from that Court, an appeal lies from it.
The Psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench."
921,"[24] In summary, the Labuick amended claim can proceed to trial which will be limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees from the Sykes’ property onto the Labuick property and whether these trees invade the Labuick air space.","The Court allowed the application in part.
It struck the portion of the claim with respect to damages from debris falling from the defendants’ tree.
Even if proven, the damages were part of urban life.
The plaintiff claimed for injunctive relief ordering the trees to be removed.
The Court had no jurisdiction to grant this relief.
The amended claim could proceed limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees into the plaintiff’s property and whether the trees invaded the plaintiff’s air space."
922,"(Emphasis added, Adjournment Decision) [43] He reviewed Anderson and Laporte, concluding as follows: [23] am satisfied by my review of the Global Document Report [the Index], which classify as equivalent to Laporte Inventory, the submissions of Crown counsel with respect to the efforts they have undertaken to disclose the relevant documents therefrom and the failure of defence counsel to demonstrate reasonable possibility that the undisclosed documents could be used to meet the case for the Crown, advance defence or otherwise assist in making decision would affect the conduct of the defence that it is appropriate for me to exercise my discretion and to find that the Crown has met its disclosure obligations.","HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered.
The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin.
He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose.
The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown.
In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations.
The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure."
923,"That interim order provided ongoing spousal support for Mr. Lawson’s wife, the respondent, Tamara Rees, in the amount of $10,000 per month; gave Ms. Rees exclusive possession of the family home; provided for shared parenting of their son and awarded child support to Ms. Rees of $2,726 per month.","HELD: The application was allowed and the stay of the enforcement of retroactive spousal support was granted.
There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support.
If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced.
The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support."
924,"[124] In this case, Constable Lair obtained Production Order which pointed to Mr. Pratchett of Fond-du-Lac, SK as being the person behind the IP address sharing the child pornography.","HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code.
Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password.
There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved.
The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only.
The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it.
The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage.
A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely.
The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence.
The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming.
The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt."
925,"March 16 to April 20, 2015 attribute this delay to the Crown on the basis that it had been in (36 days) possession of the request for trial, Form R-1 from Mr. Ali since February 6, 2015 and would had time to consider and respond to Mr. Mercier by March 16, 2015. June 22 to Nov. 3, 2015 attribute this period of delay to the Provincial Crown on the (135 days) basis that it had been in possession of the first request for trial, Form R-1 since February 6, 2016 and had time to consider and respond to Mr. Mercier during this period of time.","HELD: The application was dismissed.
The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay.
As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered.
The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay.
The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable."
926,"[13] Defence Exhibit D-2, which is video of the Rosetown Detachment hallway (the location where the accused was being observed) show that for period of time Constable De Bruin was attending to some paperwork at the counter.","HELD: The accused was not guilty of either charge.
Although the accused was lawfully stopped, the roadside demand was valid and the accused declined to exercise his right to counsel on two occasions following his arrest, the observation period at the detachment was not conducted properly.
The officer was sometimes focused on other things.
As the observation period comprised part and parcel of a breath test, the breathalyzer test was not properly administered and the Crown could not rely on the accuracy of the readings."
927,"[124] To summarize, the evidence establishes that Ms. Purdy defamed Dr. Graham in articles she wrote and that were published in the Star Phoenix newspaper and/or on the newspaper’s websites on November 28, 29 (both articles), 30 and December 1, 2007, the defamatory meanings of those words being: (a) He negligently performed surgery on Lisa Baert causing her to suffer devastating injuries and the jury’s verdict exonerating him of negligence was wrong; (b) He negligently performed surgery on Lisa Baert causing her to suffer septic shock, amputation of her hands and her legs below the knees, cardiac arrests resulting in severe brain damage leaving her with the mental capacity of child and requiring her to live in long-term care facility; (c) He negligently performed surgery on Lisa Baert causing her to become quadriplegic; (d) He did not advise the nurses or Lisa Baert that he had punctured her bowel during surgery or alternatively that he negligently failed to do so; (e) He did not advise Lisa Baert of the risks associated with tubal ligation surgery and did not receive her informed consent to perform such surgery; (f) The verdict of the jury exonerating him in his treatment of Lisa Baert was perverse; (g) He negligently performed surgery on Gloria Cooke and negligently failed to address post-surgery complications that led to septic shock, permanent chronic pain, an incisional hernia in her abdomen, the permanent loss of her stomach muscles and nearly caused her death; (h) He negligently performed surgery on Dana McLellan placing her health and life in jeopardy; (i) He negligently performed surgery on Sharry Michels causing her to suffer permanent numbness and the loss of reflex in her right knee; (j) He negligently performed surgery on Jessie Isabelle Hurlburt nearly causing her immediate death and resulting in her requiring an ileostomy bag for the rest of her life; (k) He misrepresented to Marleen Burgess that he had performed complete hysterectomy on her; (l) He negligently performed surgery on Marleen Burgess creating surgical mess; (m) He negligently performed surgery on Lynn Laursen nearly causing her death and the loss of her left leg; and (n) He is guilty of habitual negligence in his surgical practice.","HELD: The action was allowed.
The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000.
The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced.
It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000.
The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial.
She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff.
As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants.
The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages."
928,"If they had been, and if they confirmed that convention had developed whereby the plaintiff was charging minimum of three hours for job that took less time; or that travel time was being included; or that there was specific charge for miscellaneous parts that exceeded fair and reasonable price; or that retail prices and downtime for obtaining parts were charged without the express authorization of the defendant, then an evidentiary foundation would exist for the plaintiff’s position, but as have said, none of these invoices were tendered into evidence.","HELD: On the basis of the evidence presented by the parties’ experts and in absence of an express term in the contract, the court read in an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price and awarded the plaintiff such portion of the amount sought as was fair and reasonable.
The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid.
Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work."
929,"The new contract is reflected in the letter written by Conn for Tudex to Fossil for the attention of Lovell: This is to confirm our understanding that you will engage Mr. Syd Lovell as Fund Development Officer and in that capacity you will cause Mr. Lovell to devote the bulk of his time to drilling fund program for Tudex Petroleums Ltd. in accordance with the terms of that drilling program established by Tudex from time to time and in consideration thereof, it is agreed that Tudex will pay to Fossil Fuel Development Ltd. the sum of $75,000 in twelve equal and consecutive monthly instalments of $6,250 each, such instalment to be payable on the last day of each calender month commencing June 30, 1981. But at the same time find that when Conn wrote the letter that day it was intended by Tudex that Lovell was obligated under the agreement (following the market study) to bring in investment capital, and Lovell thought his part in the venture was confined to the area of introducing potential investors.","The Plaintiff contracted to provide market survey to the Defendant.
Before its completion, the contract was replaced by second contract for Fund Development Officer.
Each party had a different understanding of the duties of the Fund Development Officer which misunderstanding the Judge classified as a mutual mistake.
The failure of performance by plaintiff entitled defendant to repudiate the contract.
Defendant's counterclaim for rescission of first agreement, and repayment of monies paid under second agreement, failed where it accepted plaintiff's performance and paid consideration therefore."
930,"At the time of trial, the parties had the proceeds of the matrimonial home in the amount of $12,240.00, lot in Hague valued between $5,000.00 and $7,000.00, the applicant's furniture and household goods, the respondent's furniture and household goods, 1977 Mercury automobile, motorcycle, lawn mower and some of the respondent's tools.

This section, the Standard Form Lease and the Residential Tenancies Act, along with the Rent Review Act referred to in the section, all modify the common law position of the parties."" After the appellant gave notice to the respondents of the increase in rent in accordance with the provisions of the lease, the respondents have the right in law to complain of that increase as provided by the Rent Review Act. The appellant may increase the rent during the term of the lease, provided three month notice is given and the increase does not offend the provisions of the Rent Review Act. There is no requirement that the only method of increasing the rent be by the landlord giving three months notice to take effect at the expiration of the lease.","The issue in this appeal was whether a landlord can give notice of a rental increase at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease.

933,"Nova Scotia (Minister of Finance), leads me to conclude that in order to be eligible for exemption from health services tax pursuant to clause 10(1)(h) of the Act, machinery and equipment must be used in the actual transformation or conversion of the product actually being produced for sale.","The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act.
The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.'
The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures.
The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product.
For the plaintiff,
that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product."

The Husband had not made an interim lump sum payment in the amount of $2,000.00 ordered in May and had undertaken to provide support monies after harvest.
The Husband claimed that the value of the crop harvested was less than the farm expenses and resisted any change in the previous interim orders made.

HELD: (1)Application dismissed.
The Provincial Court judge was not biased and the accused received full disclosure with respect to the charge.
In an application to quash committal for trial there is only one ground for action by the reviewing court and that is lack of jurisdiction.
(2)Application dismissed.
The conditions imposed by the Provincial Court Judge were justified.
He did not err in law or in his application of the facts."

Dismissing the appeal,

This case is substantially different from the case of Dersh, supra, even if one accepts Dr. Kydd may have breached his duty of confidentiality to his patient.","This was an appeal from a trial court decision questioning whether the trial judge erred in determining that the appellant's rights under s.7 and s.8 of the Charter had not been violated.
When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital.
As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain.
The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer.
Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code.
The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter.
Dismissing the appeal,
that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter.
The trial judge did not err in determining that the appellant's rights were not violated under either s.7 or s.8 of the Charter."

The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property.
HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order.
Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children.
Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job.
It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support.
2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence.
She suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown.
3)The car owned by the petitioner when she married was exempt property.
The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value.
The list prepared by the respondent was used to divide household goods, tools and equipment.
4)The respondent was to assume one-half of the bank loan and it was agreed that the pension funds should be shared equally.
5)It would be unfair and inequitable to the custodial parent to order an equal division of the matrimonial property.
The petitioner was granted possession of the matrimonial home until the younger child's 18th birthday or until she vacated the property.
6)The respondent cannot avoid his responsibility of providing an adequate level of support by turning his back on well-paid employment.

942,"v. Milgaard (1971), 14 C.R. 34), Crown counsel asked Ms. Cook if reviewing the video-tape would assist her in recollecting facts. Constable Morgan indicated he knew at the time of the video-taped interview her statements in this respect were false because he had independent evidence of Mr. Gullickson's involvement.","FIAT. The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act.
She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown.
The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B.
HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents.
It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept.
1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established.
When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established.
The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability.
When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable.
2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability."

The accused says that Baikie was swinging at him over Layman's shoulder.","The accused, employed as doorman and relief bartender at the time of the altercation, was charged with assault causing bodily harm in which the complainant sustained significant injuries to his head and face.
Three crown witnesses and five defence witnesses testified as to the altercation in the bar.
HELD: The accused was found guilty.
1)The self-defence argument was not accepted.
Neither s.34 or s.37 of the Criminal Code justified the assault.
2)The testimony of the Crown witnesses was accepted.
The complainant was no threat to the accused in his inebriated state and the accused took advantage of the situation to administer a beating to him.

945,"of her first affidavit, Ms. Peddle deposed that she gave copy of Mr. Remai's fax to Bennett; that Mr. Olszewski, the property manager for Bennett, confirmed that the terms of Mr. Remai's fax were acceptable; that Bennett agreed to renew the VIP head lease for term of five years; and that she then agreed to new five-year sub- lease with the applicants on the terms they sought with the concurrence of Bennett; that she was to prepare lease renewal agreements for execution by the applicants. Position Taken by the Parties [12] Bennett made the following submissions in opposition to the application: (1) valid renewal head lease did not exist between it and VIP; (2) No valid renewal sub-leases existed between VIP and the applicants nor could they be created for lease term extending beyond the term of the VIP head lease; (3) Neither the alleged renewal head lease nor the alleged renewal sub-leases meet the requirements of s.","The applicants sought an order under s.11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-lease with either VIP Business Centre (VIP) or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd (SaskLtd).
Bennett, owner of an office building (the Plaza), leased space to VIP for five years ending in 1997.
Issues included (i)whether there had been a valid renewal of the head lease; (ii)whether there had been valid renewals of sub-leases; (iii)assuming valid renewals, did s4 of the Statute of Frauds bar enforcement against Bennett; (iv)whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear an application for relief under s11 brought solely by notice of motion; (v)are the applicants entitled to such relief; (vi)whether Bennett was bound by the sub-leases by virtue of taking the assignment from VIP.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application.
Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits.
2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion.
There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises.
The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry.
Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle.
grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion.
They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre.
The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord.
As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge.
4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages.
The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease.
The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine.
In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically.
The applciants could obtain other office space including that offered by Bennett.
General and punitive damages would provide an adequate remedy."

On the other hand, the trustee maintains the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not effect the majority of his creditors, ie: those relating to the construction of his home.","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy on the grounds that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and because his assets had been undervalued.
He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants.
The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors.
Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000.
The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy.
The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy.
HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed.
1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment.
It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances.
An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application.
2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate.
The onus will be on the bankrupt to comply with the requirements of the trustee to qualify for an automatic discharge on November 15/98 or an early discharge as provided for in s168.1(2)."

His proportionate share of orthodontic expenses was 86% ($1,677) to be paid by five payments of $280.
2)The respondent's average income over 1994-96 for the purpose of determining child support was $32,243.39.
The 1997 income information was not included because the financial evidence was insufficient.
15% of the capital cost allowance was imputed pursuant to s19 for the 1994-96 taxation years.
Deducting all of the respondent's capital cost allowance was not a reasonable expense.
An adverse inference was not drawn from the failure to produce the financial records of the respondent's farming partner.

The children had been in the care of the Minister at various times and parent aides provided help to the parents when there was child or children at home.
The Minister called 18 witnesses.
HELD: All three children were committed permanently to the Minister.
1)The mother appeared to be more anxious about excusing the father, who was an abusive alcoholic, than about protecting the children.
The mother was unable to parent any of the children on her own.
It was concluded under s.11(b) of the Act that there was no adult person able and willing to provide for the children's needs and physical or emotional harm may come to the children if it had not already.

The father is currently employed at Ipsco on shift work and is currently living with his parents.
The father has had the child since the separation and the child has had little access with his mother.
HELD: The child's primary residence should be with the mother.
Based on the information before the Court, the mother has always been the primary caregiver of the child and remained at home with the child for the first year of his life.
The mother was responsible for the child's day to day needs, health care and child care.

One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery.
Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege.
The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor.
HELD: 1)Relevancy.
The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence.
Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant.
Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous.
Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not.
Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial.
Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable.
Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced.
Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked.
The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant.
Leave was granted to reapply for direction.
2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed.
The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged.
(b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted.
The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed.
The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda.
(c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable.
The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident.
While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable.
A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants.
(d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial.
Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference.
(e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged.
It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident.
(f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement.
The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer.
Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview.
(g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation.
3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees.
The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed.
Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues.
4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days.
5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed.
The question was relevant only to character.
Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion.
6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed."
957,"on June 1, 1999 with respect to an application by the defendant to set aside proposed amendments to the original statement of claim and the joinder of parties to that claim.","FIAT. It was held in an earlier fiat in June that the addition of the two proposed plaintiffs asserted new causes of action and amendments to the statement of claim could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act.
The defendant resisted the joinder of the new plaintiffs and amendments on the basis of undue delay and actual prejudice.
The statement of claim alleged nuisance, and in the alternative, negligence against the City with respect to the design, construction and maintenance of the sewer system causing his basement to flood.
The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time.
Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied.
The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes.
HELD: The amendments were allowed.
1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage.
The facts were uncertain.
It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced.
If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period.
2)Inexcusable delay was not established.
3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice.
If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction.
No evidence had been lost.
The basement was available for inspection.
It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants.
4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments.
The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice.
It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff.
It appeared that the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendment was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued and arose out of the same occurrence.
4)Costs in the cause."
958,"[10] Only if the Agreement is lease and is not covered by The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, would hold that Case Credit is not barred by implied acceptance of Mr. Poirier's condition that he be released from further liability, because of exclusionary clause eight of the Agreement.","The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer.
The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act.
HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3.
1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment.
The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale.
Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party.
Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used.
The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law.
The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer.
He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours.
The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract.
The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment.
He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability.
Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent.
To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors.
Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55.
It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure.
5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause.
Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3."
959,"For the purposes of this Act, in an action in personam court of foreign country has jurisdiction in the following cases only: (a) where the defendant is, at the time of the commencement of the action, ordinarily resident in that country; (b) where the defendant, when the judgment is obtained, is carrying on business in that country and that country is province or territory of Canada; (c) where the defendant has submitted to the jurisdiction of that court: (i) by becoming plaintiff in the action; or (ii) by voluntarily appearing as defendant in the action without protest; or (iii) by having expressly or impliedly agreed to submit thereto.","The defendant manufactured solarium in Saskatoon which it sold to the plaintiffs in Minnesota.
The plaintiffs alleged the solarium was defective, sued and obtained judgment in the Minnesota Court which it now sought to enforce in Saskatchewan.
The defendant argued the Minnesota court did not have jurisdiction because at the time the action was commenced he was not 'ordinarily resident' in the state of Minnesota.
The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction.
HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed.
1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act.
2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there.
The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product.
The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address.
It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state.
The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'."
960,"The driver of the Sunfire says that she saw the Defendant get out of the truck and come over to her vehicle. [33] Section 258(1)(c)of the Criminal Code states in part: 158.(1) In any proceedings under subsection 255(1) in respect of an offence committed under section 253 or in any proceedings under subsection 255(2) or (3), nan (c) where samples of the breath of the accused have been taken pursuant to demand made under subsection 254(3), if (ii) each sample was taken as soon as practicable after the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed and, in the case of the first sample, not later than two hours after that time, with an interval of at least fifteen minutes between the times when the samples were taken, nan evidence of the results of the analyses so made is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, proof that the concentration of alcohol in the blood of the accused at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed was, where the results of the analyses are the same, the concentration determined by the analyses and, where the results of the analyses are different, the lowest of the concentrations determined by the analyses; [34] The driver of the Sunfire estimated the time of the accident to be 1:30 a.m. She said that she dropped friend off, between 1:15 and 1:20 a.m. She then drove from Turtle Crescent to Warman to Circle Drive to reach the intersection of College Drive where the collision occurred.","Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified.
The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light.
The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m.
After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication.
The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m.
The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m.
The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan.
The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m.
At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample.
HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant.
The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified.
The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code.
The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident.
On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.
The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial.
When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness.
This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony.
The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered.
The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice.
Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers.
The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges.
There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion.
Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate.
After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development.
stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases.
Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence.
The Charter application for a stay of proceedings alleging a breach of fundamental justice is denied."
961,"771 for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into by the accused, Lloyd Eugene Bailey, and the surety, Reverend Wrenford Bryant, in the amount of $1,000.00, which was given to secure the release of the accused pending his trial on a number of criminal charges.","The accused was charged with four offences relating to a twelve year old girl, including sexual assault and uttering a threat.
He was released on bail with a surety.
The accused is paraplegic.
He moved to British Columbia after his release.
He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest.
He was arrested and returned to stand trial.
The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited.
It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000.
It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000.
The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default.
Dismissing the applications for forfeiture,
that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities.
In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture.
With respect to the accused, he is impecunious.
His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment.
As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence."
962,"As an aside, whatever the practical problem, it did not prevent the Legislature of the Northwest Territories from providing regime for both those in marriage relationship and those in defined common law relationship to have the same rights with respect to property and assets in its new Family Law Act. This Statute was adopted by Nunavut (see Family Law Act (Nunavut) S.N.W.T. 1997, c.","The appellant and respondent lived together in common law relationship for approximately ten years.
Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets.
They separated in 1995.
The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets.
She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship.
The Chambers judge dismissed the application.
He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter.
Allowing the appeal,
that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship.
The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.
The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect.
This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter."
963,"[9] Section 19(3) provides the authority for the court to make an order of relief from forfeiture: 19(3) Where court is satisfied that any person, other than (a) person who was charged with designated substance offence, or (b) person who acquired title to or right of possession of the property from person referred to in paragraph (a) under circumstances that give rise to reasonable inference that the title or right was transferred for the purpose of voiding the forfeiture of the property, is the lawful owner or is lawfully entitled to possession of any property or any part of any property that would otherwise be forfeited pursuant to an order made under sub-section 16(1) or 17(2) and that the person appears innocent of any complicity in an offence referred to in paragraph (a) or of any collusion in relation to such an offence, the court may order that the property or part be returned to that person.","The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act.
The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order.
The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln.
She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking.
The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking.
The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed.
HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1).
The application for relief was dismissed.
1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20.
2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence.
3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence.
There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here).
The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary.
In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment."
964,"16 (1) With respect to the permanent closing of schools, every school board shall either follow the procedures described in Sections 17 to 23 or prepare and adhere to written statement of policies and procedures that provides for (a) public notification of the board's intention to consider closing school; (b) public participation in the process of reaching decision on permanent closing of school; (c) public access to all information that the school board uses to make its decision on the permanent closing of school and to the report described in clause (f); (d) consideration of all foreseeable educational and financial consequences and the effects on the community of the permanent closing of the school; (e) sufficient time for the actions required under clauses (a) to (d) to be satisfactorily completed; and (f) report that (i) shall be presented to the school board no later than December 31 in the calendar year in which school has been permanently closed, (ii) shall be provided by the principal or principals responsible for the school or schools to which the students from the permanently closed school have been transferred, and (iii) describes the educational and social progress of the transferred students and their adjustment to their new school or schools.","The applicants applied for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the school board to close two schools.
The applicants were parents of children who attended one of the two closed schools.,
application allowed in part; certiorari granted in respect of the decision to close the school which the applicants' children attended; the applicants had no standing to challenge the closure of the second school as they were not directly affected by its closure.
The School Board breached its general duty to act fairly in allowing a Board member to vote when he had not attended the public meetings on the issue.
The Board did not meet the onus on it to show that the member had appropriate firsthand knowledge of the evidence and submission of the applicants."
965,"AND UPON this Honourable Court's Order, dated October 30, 2001, directing Vance Joudrey to appear before the Court on Tuesday, the 13th day of November, 2001, at the hour of 9:30 o'clock in the forenoon, to show cause why Vance Joudrey should not be held in contempt of Court and, if required, to perform or abide by such other Order as the Court may make; AND UPON HEARING Ian Pickard on behalf of the Plaintiff and Robert Cragg on behalf of Vance Joudrey; AND UPON IT APPEARING to the satisfaction of the Court that the said Vance Joudrey has been guilty of contempt of Court in that he failed to abide by the Order of this Honourable Court in the within proceeding dated January 9, 2001; IT IS ORDERED that for his contempt, Vance Joudrey be ordered to pay fine in the amount of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000); AND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Sheriff enter upon the property of the Defendant and collect and receive the rents, profits and income thereof until the Defendant clears his contempt by complying with Order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Robert Wright, dated the 9th day of January, 2001, namely, full compliance with the Land Use By-Laws of the Halifax Regional Municipality; AND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that in order to ensure compliance with the Order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Robert Wright, dated the 9th day of January, 2001, the Defendant must forthwith, in any event prior to December 1, 2001, undertake the following work: 1.","The defendant made an addition to single family residence.
Following a dispute between the parties as to whether the defendant's use of the property now complied with the plaintiff's land-use bylaw for a single family residence, a consent order was issued dealing with the structure of the property and how it would be used.
The plaintiff sought a finding that the defendant was in contempt of the consent order, seeking enforcement of the provisions of the consent order and an order that the defendant pay a fine.
Defendant found in contempt of consent order; fine ordered in the amount of $10,000; if defendant has not complied with the terms of the consent order by January 31, 2002, the Sheriff is ordered to enter the property and receive the rents, profits and income thereof until the defendant clears his contempt; the door and hardware between the original structure and the addition is be removed; any references to separate apartments are to be removed from the property; the second power meter is to be removed from the property and the second cable television connection and associated billing provisions are to be eliminated; the defendant is to provide within 15 days the names of all tenants and if and when there are changes in any of the tenants, he must provide the plaintiff with the particulars of the new and remaining tenants; all tenants must be notified in writing prior to entry of occupation that the entire structure and building is only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit; copies of any written leases are to be provided to the plaintiff within 15 days of their execution; the plaintiff can enter the premises for the purposes of random inspection on a bi-monthly basis until the plaintiff is satisfied that this Order has been complied with and thereafter, the plaintiff is entitled to inspect the premises at random once a month while the defendant remains the owner of the property; the fine will not be crystallized into a judgment and execution if the defendant complies fully with all the requirements of this order on or before January 1, 2002.
The plaintiff is entitled to solicitor-client costs."
966,"If the parties agreed to impute income the respondent has the onus of satisfying the Court that there has been material change in his condition, means, needs or other circumstances, which if known at the time of the consent judgment, would have resulted in different determination of his income.","The mother had custody of the 12 and year olds under the terms of the January 10, 2000 consent judgment.
The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000.
The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances.
This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference.
It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service.
There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule.
The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends.
The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times.
This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children."
967,"[16] The plaintiff, argues however, that an adverse inference should be drawn by virtue of the defendant's failure to adduce evidence by Mr. Orban confirming that he had in fact cleaned the floor of the produce department at 2:52 p.m. and made the entry on the sweep log.","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000.
The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces.
Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue.
The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules.
HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.
1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier.
The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard.
Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care.
2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor.
The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor.
3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor.
The employee was no longer employed by the defendant.
Neither party was able to locate him.
4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions.
The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice.
The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision.
5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department.
The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping.
A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area.
The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases.
The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries.
To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances."
968,"122 (C.A.)) [6] Upon convicting the appellant, the learned trial judge made the following comments: In all of these circumstances, must ask myself whether applying the test in Stellato, Mr. Matchee's driving was departure from the norm, and have to say, at the end of the day, think it was.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving (Criminal Code s.249(1)(a)) and sentence of a $1,200 fine, $180 surcharge, and 18 month driving prohibition.
In issue was whether the evidence found by the trial judge established both the mens rea and actus reus beyond a reasonable doubt.
The sentence appeal was brought on the ground it did not take into account mitigating circumstances, case law or sentencing principles.
HELD: The appeal against conviction was dismissed.
The driving prohibition was reduced to 9 months.
The fine and surcharge were confirmed.
1)By applying the wrong standard, the trial judge committed an error of law, but no miscarriage of justice occurred.
When the correct standard, as enunciated in Hundal, is applied to the evidence as found by the trial judge, the conviction was appropriate.
2)The application of the Stellato principle to a charge of dangerous driving under s.249(1) was an error in law.
The conclusion that the Crown need only establish proof of any degree of impairment and not a marked departure from normal behaviour does not apply to a charge under s.249.
Simple judgmental errors in routine driving do not constitute conduct amounting to a marked departure from the standard of care required.
Mere negligence or driving without due care and attention are not sufficient.
3)The accused's evidence did not address how fast he was going (he stated his speedometer was not working) nor over what route or the time of the chase.
There was ample evidence on those issues from the two Crown witnesses.
4)The findings of fact established the appellant's driving conduct did amount to a marked departure from the standard of care a reasonable person would exercise in those circumstances.
The test is whether a reasonably prudent driver in the circumstances ought to have been aware of the risk and of the danger involved in his driving conduct.
The accused engaged in a planned and deliberate course of conduct when he gave chase and continued over a significant distance at a high speed at night with children and other pedestrians in the vicinity.
It was not necessary for the Crown to establish the collision caused significant damage or that a collision occurred at all.
The acceptance of the accused's assertion that the collision was inadvertent did not mean the Crown failed to prove the necessary mens rea.
5)An 18 month prohibition was excessive.
The conduct was at the low end of the continuum.
He was employed as a truck driver and relied on his operator's licence to earn a living.
He chased the other vehicle because he believed its occupants stole tapes from his vehicle.
Although he was convicted for refusal to provide breath samples 2 years ago, alcohol was not a factor here."
969,"Wheeler (1912), 1912 CanLII 513 (ON SC), D.L.R. 352 (Ont. H.C.)) Mr. Justice Binnie's consideration of the law with respect to change of use must be considered.","The applicant operated commercial private billiards club with liquor licence and served bar food.
The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation.
The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement.
The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use.
Application granted;
the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change.
There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed."
970,The court cannot substitute its opinion for that of the trial court that the evidence proves guilt beyond reasonable doubt because the accused is entitled to that decision from trial judge or jury who have all the advantages that have been so often conceded to belong to the trial of fact.,"The police observed the appellant's vehicle rub another vehicle and followed him to where he parked without difficulty.
While taking the appellant to where the incident occurred, the officer noted slight smell of alcohol and bloodshot eyes.
The appellant failed the ALERT test and refused the breathalyzer.
The refusal charge was dismissed and the appellant was convicted of impaired driving.
The appellant appealed.
Appeal allowed; conviction quashed.
The evidence of impairment was too weak to convict the appellant.
The officer told the accused that if he passed the ALERT test, he would be sent on his way.
Thus, she must not have thought that the appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired.
Failure to act cannot be considered by the trial judge as part of the reasonable and probable grounds."
971,"There is similarly evidence that he went through Mrs. Barks’ -- sorry, that there was a second occasion when, on Mr. Federuik’s admission, he came into the back yard and his daughter had either gotten the dog off its logging chain leash, which would indicate that there weren’t reasonable steps taken to prevent a small person, a small child, or the dog from getting free itself.","The accused was charged with owning a dog that without provocation attacked a person contrary to the Urban Municipality Act s.135.3(3).
There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001.
At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions.
The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced.
HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions.
The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post.
There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled.
The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty.
2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt.
On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation.
3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3).
It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands.
The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed.
logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog.
One would not expect dog to be attached to logging chain if there were no concerns."
972,"Mr. Harder was ordered to pay child support of $534 per month for Jasmine and Sloane commencing September 1, 2001 plus $70 per month for Jasmine’s riding lessons and $60 per month for Sloane’s hockey. It is hereby ordered that Mr. Harder shall pay to Ms. Harder for the support of their son, Sloane Allan Harder, born April 8, 1986, the sum of $308 per month commencing April 1, 2003 and continuing on the first day of each and every month thereafter so long as Sloane remains a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 5.","FIAT. At issue was whether there a change of circumstances, which would warrant a variation of the 2002 child support order; whether the 18 year old continued to be a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act; does the father have an obligation to contribute to his daughter's riding lessons; the father's income for child support purposes; should the 17 year old son's s.7 expenses be increased; costs.
HELD: 1)The daughter had ceased to be a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and the father's obligation to provide on-going support and his contribution for s.7 expenses relating to her riding lesson terminated in March 2003.
2)The father shall pay $308 per month for support of his son commencing April 1, 2003 and every month thereafter so long as he remains a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act.
3)The mother's application to increase the father's contribution for the son's extracurricular activities was dismissed.
The father shall pay $54 per month for hockey expenses commencing June 2003 and every month thereafter.
4)The mother was to forthwith pay costs of the application fixed at $250."
973,"Additionally, the materials filed, including the affidavit of the representative of the applicant trustee in bankruptcy, represents and satisfies me that there are no other interests that will be adversely affected if the vesting order applied for is granted. Q-1.01 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances before the court, nevertheless the court is now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Land Titles Act, 2000 does so.","FIAT. The receiver manager of the registered owner (the numbered company) under the Bankruptcy Act and the instrument appointed receiver on behalf of the secured creditor and mortgagee (HSBC Bank) applied for a vesting order.
The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year.
HELD: The vesting order was granted.
1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so.
In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87.
2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor.
The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price.
The registered owner had taken no opposition.
No other interests will be adversely affected.
3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment."
974,"Action or non-action by the accused which is inconsistent with desire for timely trial is something that the court must consider, R.v. Morin (supra at p. Institutional delay of 13 months in the context of this particular offender charged with these particular offences gives rise to an inferred prejudice, and renders his trial unfair in that he is not able to be tried within reasonable time.","The defendant applied for a stay of proceedings on the basis of a violation of his right to be tried in a reasonable time.
There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial.
Stay of proceedings granted.
At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts.
Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered."
975,"As it turns out, final reasons were filed that day, but because notice of appeal in relation to those reasons was filed almost immediately, Wright J.’s order came into effect and has been in effect for the past two weeks. [6] Under the order of Wright J., $600.00 maintenance is payable by the father on the first of each month. [8] Since oral argument, when the mother assumed that maintenance would be paid, the father’s counsel filed detailed brief arguing that staying the execution of Klebuc J.’s judgment does not revive the prior maintenance order and that Court of Appeal chambers judge does not have the authority to make such an order.","This was an application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules.
HELD: The Court declined to lift the stay.
While a chambers judge acting under s. 20 of The Court of Appeal Act may not have the independent authority to make a maintenance order, a chambers judge has the authority to stay a judgment in its entirety in the Court of Queen's Bench in certain cases as long as doing so does not decide the appeal.
The Court of Appeal stayed the decision of Klebuc J., which left the order of Wright in place, which maintained the existing maintenance obligation."
976,The six-month delay which includes that time attributable to the accused and that time caused by the court is not so long as to lead to an inference of prejudice to the accused nor does any potential prejudice caused by the delay outweigh the public interest in having the accused face trial on these charges.,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time.
The accused was charged on July 3, 2003 with common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code, threatening to use weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Code, and destroying property of value less than $5,000 contrary to s. 430(4) of the Code.
On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court.
The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources.
On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004.
On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004.
HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed.
1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months.
This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry.
2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children.
There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this.
3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking.
As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused.
3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence."
977,"[31] Having given careful consideration to the evidence of the alleged erratic driving, and the accused’s explanation for it, in my view, the aspects which were observed may well have been the result of driver inattention which could have occurred whether or not his ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drug.","The accused youth is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code.
The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.
HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.
Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them.
The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted.
1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes.
His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane.
The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period.
The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2)
The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking.
Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes.
3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4)
The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5)
The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner.
If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment.
The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations.
He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour.
In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them.
6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions.
However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face."
978,"The Tribunal further erred in law in finding that the City was not prejudiced by the considerable time that has elapsed since many of the events raised since this complaint took place; The Tribunal erred in law in deciding that the City was responsible for harassment against Mr. Kivela, factoring that finding into the overall decision on liability and remedy for discrimination: Procedurally, during the hearing of this matter, and later, in its written submissions, the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission (“Commission”) took the position that harassment was no longer an issue being pursued in the proceedings, with the result that the City presented limited evidence on the issue of harassment; The Tribunal has improperly imparted to the City burden akin to vicarious liability or fiduciary duty regarding the alleged acts of harassment which either were unknown to the supervisors of Mr. Kivela, or were events in which such supervisors acted appropriately in the circumstances; The Tribunal erred in its application of the law on the duty to accommodate in ruling that the City should also have accommodated Mr. Kivela retroactively when the City took steps in 1996 to remedy the situation of others passing Mr. Kivela by in acquiring seniority.","This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE.
It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent.
The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability.
The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE.
The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability.
The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination.
The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship.
The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability.
HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed.
The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal.
1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review.
If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness.
In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable.
Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies.
2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer.
The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions.
The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan.
The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000.
But by this time, he was unable to work.
3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others.
It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner.
4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant.
The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination.
The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory.
5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship.
6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence.
There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions.
Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant.
If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees.
Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous.
It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship.
7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct.
The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination.
The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal."
979,"[31] With respect to Count No. that the accused did endanger the life of Bear by attempting to strike her with motor vehicle, there is evidence that the accused did drive the truck dangerously close to Bear and Darnell while Bear was laying on the driveway.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code; assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Code; dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Code; and two counts of assault contrary to s. 266(a) of the Code.
HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict.
2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant.
The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result,
the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm.
3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter.
It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered.
The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public.
The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct.
The offence of dangerous driving was established and the accused was found guilty.
4) The accused was found guilty of two counts of assault."
980,"The main ground of the application is that the service of the statement of claim on the defendant did not comply with Rule 19(1) of The Queen’s Bench Rules. [5] In my opinion however, Rule 18 now requires the defendant to satisfy the court that he has not received “notice of the document,” being the statement of claim herein, before the circumstances referred to by Zarzeczny J.","FIAT: This is an application to set aside a noting for default and the resulting default judgment.
The main ground of the application is that the service of the statement of claim on the defendant did not comply with Rule 19(1) of The Queen's Bench Rules.
HELD: The application is dismissed and the service upon the defendant by registered mail is validated.
1) Rule 19(1) of the Rules must be read in conjunction with Rule 18.
2) Queen's Bench Rule 18 is new rule and came into effect in December 2002.
No authorities were available that considered its provisions.
3) Rule 18 requires the defendant to satisfy the court that he has not received notice of the document.
4) The defendant admits receiving a copy of the statement of claim by registered mail and the fact that it did not constitute valid service is of no assistance to him."
981,"(7) variation order varying spousal support order should (a) recognize any economic advantages or disadvantages to the former spouses arising from the marriage or its breakdown; (b) apportion between the former spouses any financial consequences arising from the care of any child of the marriage over and above any obligation for the support of any child of the marriage; (c) relief any economic hardship of the former spouses arising from the breakdown of the marriage; and (d) insofar as practicable, promote the economic self-sufficiency of each former spouse within reasonable period of time. ordered indefinite support in 12 year marriage where the wife was on Canada Pension Plan disability.","The husband applied to vary a corollary relief judgment in order to either terminate spousal support or decrease it with a fixed date for termination.
The parties were married for twelve years and had been divorced for seven years.
The husband had been paying $600 per month in spousal support since the divorce and had recently retired from the military; his current income was now primarily derived from his pension.
The wife had serious long-term mental illness and was unable to manage employment.
The parties' teenage son was now solely in the husband's care.
Spousal support reduced to $300 per month payable for a further three years at which point it will terminate.
Notwithstanding the wife's disability, the husband's obligation to her should not extend beyond the length of their marriage; although the wife might not be able to become totally self-sufficient, there was no evidence that she was unable to contribute anything at all towards her own support."
982,"said In order to give an “air of reality” to the defence of honest but mistaken belief, there must be (1) evidence of lack of consent to the sexual acts; and (2) evidence that notwithstanding the actual refusal, the accused honestly but mistakenly believed that the complainant was consenting. After looking at all of the evidence, I cannot see anything in the evidence to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that T.D. consented to the sexual contact in question.","The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code.
The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police.
In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace.
The Crown proceeded summarily.
The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch.
The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her.
The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence.
HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office.
1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature.
The complainant did not consent to the contact.
2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature.
The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious.
However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace.
He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison.
When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic.
The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity.
Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact.
The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her."
983,"In this case, there is hearsay evidence from Michelle Lenius’ police report and statements that she made to others regarding the alleged choking incidents.","Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife.
The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death.
In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been.
In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her.
The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi.
HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible.
The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value.
It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this.
To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value.
In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred.
The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice.
That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime.
There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice.
That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge.
There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction.
With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted.
The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify.
However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath."
984,"Constable Pura agreed that Mr. Hashemian was not physically involved with the arresting officers at any time prior to her and Constable Rodgers arresting Ms. Krupa, which was done after Mr. Sampson had been handcuffed. [28] With respect to what transpired outside of the lounge on the sidewalk, Constable Pura notes Mr. Sampson was about to be placed in the police car, from which infer he was already handcuffed, when Mr. Hashemian and Ms. Krupa again showed up.","The plaintiff seeks damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction.
During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp.
He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning.
The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service.
The City of Saskatoon is their employer.
HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed.
The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle.
The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount.
It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements.
1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge.
The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty.
The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully.
The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty.
2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help.
Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa.
Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers.
Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty.
There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty.
3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions.
The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty.
The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed.
4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention.
The plaintiff experienced headaches for several weeks.
He also had stiff neck and sleep disturbance.
There were no long term effects.
Corrigendum received January 25, 2005 and added to fulltext."
985,"[7] Cumulatively, what the plaintiff now seeks is an order that the affidavit of Donald Beveridge dated July 15, 2005, be struck, that the application for leave to amend the statement of defence be dismissed, that summary judgment be granted against Peak Enterprises Inc., that the defences of each of the defendants be struck out by reason of their failure to comply with their obligations, including failure to make production of documents, and that solicitor‑and‑client costs be awarded against the defendant, Donald Beveridge for the cross‑examination and the application, in any event of the cause.","There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation.
The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules.
It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought.
The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation.
HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares.
Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment.
The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution.
Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares.
The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005.
The principal amount of her shares is $214,600.
It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment.
Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court.
The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act.
2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation.
The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings.
Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable.
3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129.
The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129.
Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement.
4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants.
5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs."
986,"[63] Considering the span of time over which the plaintiff closely observed Mr. Burke as shoplifter, including his arrest of Mr. Burke amidst death threats and holding him until the police arrived, coupled with the close proximity in time within which he next saw Mr. Burke behind the wheel of the van that struck him, all seen through the eyes of security officer with several years experience, am satisfied that the plaintiff’s identification evidence is credible and reliable and that it was Charles Burke who ran him down in the parking lot.","The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter.
The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle.
The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer.
As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages.
The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed.
The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle."
987,"It was argued that if the trial judge had this evidence, which contradicted Ms. Bodkin’s statement that she was not dealer, this would have been enough to raise reasonable doubt in Mr. Drury’s favour. do, however, believe that she is still in Saskatoon and still able to provide evidence.[3] During the trial, Mr. Drury testified that two witnesses were going to testify but that he could no longer find them.[4] [7] The second affidavit, dated April 12, 2006, is from Sherry Brinkman who swears that at some point in the past she knew Ms. Bodkin as methamphetamine dealer.","The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence.
HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed.
There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed.
1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission.
2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us.
All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay.
Any evidence sought to be adduced under the discretion of what is now s. 683 of the Code must be admissible evidence.
With respect to the evidence of Ms. Brinkman, she does not swear that Ms. Bodkin was selling methamphetamine at the relevant time.
3) With respect to due diligence, it must be noted that the appellant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who represents him before this court.
The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward.
If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems.
4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered."
988,"[19] The defendants argue that the statement of claim does not disclose cause of action as against any of the defendants as any potential claim that any of the passengers of Flight 361 might possibly have against any of the defendants is governed solely by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999 and that the requirement of Article 17(1), that namely, bodily injury must be established by the applicant has not been met.","The plaintiff applies for certification pursuant to The Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight from the Dominican Republic to Regina.
The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties.
The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract.
HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act.
The application for certification is dismissed on that basis.
1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999.
The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear.
Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999.
The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action.
2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999.
strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking.
It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish.
It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361.
It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action.
Corrigendum received dated July 20, 2006 and added to fulltext."
989,The individual items are as follows: (i) non‑arm’s length salaries; (ii) personal expenses claimed as farm expenses; (iii) capital cost allowance on real property owned by the father; (iv) capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father; (v) personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses; (vi) capital cost allowance on real property owned by the partnership; and (vii) capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the partnership.,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation.
Division of the matrimonial property is at issue.
The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments.
HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable.
In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000.
It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3)
Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income.
The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use.
It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4)
The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle.
He states the personal use of his truck is 10%.
The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle.
This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5)
The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners.
The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him.
His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis.
There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins.
There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership.
There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father.
This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation.
This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase.
There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically.
There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term.
The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership.
6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year.
Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount."
990,"[8] The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. v. Brydges, 1990 CanLII 123 (SCC), [1990] S.C.R. 190, the police are required to not only advise detainees of their right to immediate free legal advice, but to advise detainees of the existence and availability of the applicable systems of duty counsel and Legal Aid in that jurisdiction.","The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent.
The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample.
The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer.
HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable.
Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists.
Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice.
2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice.
Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal.
3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated.
The exchange lasted about minutes.
The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer."
991,Patchrite never registered an interest at the personal property security registry as lessor of the equipment leased to Sweeprite either of the original Equipment Lease or the extension or renewal agreement.,"The Bank presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent corporation respecting assets leased by the respondent to Sweeprite.
By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease.
This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act.
HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act.
The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration.
Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank.
1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment.
The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement.
Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent.
Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years.
2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite.
It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way.
3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business."
992,"2) On July 2, 2003, Ms. Duncan wrote indicating the petitioner and respondent had agreed between themselves the following: (a) They shall continue to have joint custody of the children; (b) Ms. Smith shall have reasonable access; (c) Ms. Smith shall pay child support to Mr. Goethals in the sum of $380.00 per month commencing July 1, 2003.","The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support.
HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2)
The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children.
What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college.
What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006.
There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006.
3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part.
There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns.
No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines.
No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'.
The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310.
An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner.
The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children.
4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually.
Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children.
5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category.
The application for retroactive child support is dismissed."
993,AMCI’s liability under the Agreement for the other three quarters has still to be determined but the issues should not be as involved as they would otherwise be based on the court’s decision on the summary judgment application.,"The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant for failing to supply three of the four quarterly amounts of coal due pursuant to their contract.
Following a two-day summary judgment application, the court granted judgment for one of the three quarters, with damages to be determined.
Costs were at issue for the summary judgment application as well as a previous application brought by the defendant to compel document production.
The defendant's application was resolved prior to being heard in Chambers, but only after discovery examination was held in New York.
Costs awarded for the summary judgment application on the basis of $2,000 per day for a total of $4,000 (the plaintiff is not precluded from seeking further costs after damages have been determined), plus taxable disbursements; costs awarded on the defendant's application as a half-day Chambers application in the amount of $1,000, with the plaintiff to also pay the disbursements incurred by the defendant in filing the application; travel costs for the defendant's counsel to attend in New York; and the costs of preparation, travel, food and lodging for its expert witness to attend the discovery."
994,"That being so, and having regard once again for the 30 second time-frame the appellant was on fire, including the time it took him to exit the vehicle, she was of the opinion expert evidence was necessary to enable the jury to conclude that the actions of the Fire Department fell short of the standard of care and constituted acts of negligence.","This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants.
The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants.
The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents.
In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents.
The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered.
Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns.
The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle.
In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury.
On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents.
That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents.
2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs."
995,"TOWN OF MARTENSVILLE DEFENDANT Self and Jennifer Isaac(daughter) For the plaintiff Brad Weiss and Steven Haichert, SGI For the defendant R.D. Jackson, PCJ JUDGMENT July 30, 2007 BACKGROUND [1] The plaintiff brings action for water damage sustained to her former residence located at 233 - 1st Street South, Martensville, when frozen pipes burst.","The plaintiff sues the defendant town for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst.
The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained.
HELD: The claim is dismissed.
1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water.
2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained.
3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself.
She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property.
No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned.
Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her."
996,"[23] Accordingly, based upon Justice Foley’s original findings, the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child when she was in his care, as well as the mother’s conduct since Justice Foley’s order in attempting to avoid shared parenting, I am satisfied that it is in the child’s best interests to grant sole custody of the child to the father.","The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule.
The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment.
The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order.
The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody.
The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother.
The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes.
The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child.
The issues were as follows.
1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child?
2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon?
3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother?
HELD: Application allowed.
The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1)
The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child.
The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible.
As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case.
Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father.
2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse.
In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse.
3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply.
Detailed orders are issued accordingly."
997,"In addition, FNUC and its Board have interfered with the academic freedom of Dr. Stonechild, in violation of the FNUC/URFA Academic Collective Bargaining Agreement (2002-2005).","Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties.
The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom.
The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved.
After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn.
The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention.
When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member.
No decision was reached at that meeting.
The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer.
The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement.
Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom.
HELD: The application is dismissed with costs.
The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement.
The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test.
The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement.
The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly."
998,"(5) When the offender establishes to the satisfaction of the court that undue hardship to the offender or the dependants of the offender would result from payment of the victim surcharge, the court may, on application of the offender, make an order exempting the offender from the application of subsection (1). [5] In the result, the sentence is varied to include an order requiring the Respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30.00.","The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived.
The appeal is made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Criminal Code.
HELD: The imposition of a victim fine surcharge under s. 737 of the code is mandatory subject only to an application under s. 737(5) relating to undue hardship.
If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharge, it is also mandatory that the Court give reasons.
The sentence is varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30."
999,"This section provides as follows 515.(10) For the purposes of this section, the detention of an accused in custody is justified only on one or more of the following grounds: (a) where the detention is necessary to ensure his or her attendance in court in order to be dealt with according to law; (b) where the detention is necessary for the protection or safety of the public, having regard to all the circumstances including any substantial likelihood that the accused will, if released from custody, commit criminal offence or interfere with the administration of justice; and (c) on any other just cause being shown and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, where the detention is necessary in order to maintain confidence in the administration of justice, having regard to all the circumstances, including the apparent strength of the prosecution’s case, the gravity of the nature of the offence, the circumstances surrounding its commission and the potential for lengthy term of imprisonment.","The accused brings an application pursuant to s. 520 of the Criminal Code for a review of the order denying him judicial interim release.
HELD: The accused's continued detention is necessary for the protection of the public
The Court puts significant weight on the accused's continued disregard of court orders and the fact that the number and severity of the assault incidents is increasing.
The accused received the benefit of conditional sentence in April 2006 and in July was found to have breached the orders which formed part of the conditional sentence.
He is now facing additional allegations of breach.
Even though he was bound by conditional sentence and was charged with another violent offence, which is alleged to have occurred in September, he was once again released from custody in October.
This was followed by the allegation of yet another and more serious assault which has lead to the accused remaining in custody for the last months."
1000,2) The plaintiff’s claim is grounded on a provision of the Union’s by-laws which reads: Article XII - Indemnity Clause  CUPE Local 59 shall pay the cost of: 12.1 a) Defending an action or proceeding against Union officer claiming liability on the part of that Union officer for acts or omissions done or made by the Union officer in the course of his/her duties or paying any sum required to settle the action or proceeding; b) Damages and costs awarded against Union officer as result of the finding of liability on the part of that Officer for acts or omissions done or made by the Union officer in the course of his/her actions.,"The plaintiff is an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Union.
He commenced this claim based on the Indemnity Clause contained in the Union's bylaws.
The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause.
HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed.
The within action is dismissed in full.
1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws.
This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board.
The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment.
2) The plaintiff represents himself.
He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000.
The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions.
3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed.
The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success."
1001,"Cregan, Q.C. Heard: June 26 2008 Written Decision: July 7, 2008 Subject: Application to be discharged from liability for student loans under Subsection 178(1.l) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. Summary: A school teacher owed approximately $20,000 in student loans. Accordingly, shall only review what find to be evidence respecting the other requirement under this subsection, namely whether his financial difficulty is so extensive that he will be unable to pay his liabilities under the loan.","The applicant school teacher asked to be discharged from $20k in student loan debts under s.178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.
He had filed consumer proposal in 2001, which he completed successfully in 2006.
He earned $50,874 (gross) per annum; was at the top of his pay scale; had two young children; and his wife worked half-time position at Aliant, earning $16,272 year.
There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable).
The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards.
The applicant did not have any credit either.
Their home had little, if any, equity.
The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt.
Application allowed.
Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan.
Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability.
If the application were refused, he would have to consider bankruptcy."
1002,[1] have read the reasons for judgment of Madam Justice Smith allowing this appeal and setting aside the order of the Chambers judge on the basis that he acted without any evidence that certain activities of the children were extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Federal Child Support Guidelines[1] (“the Guidelines”) and that he failed to consider and apply the definition of “special and extraordinary expenses” in s.,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act.
The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.'
The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines.
The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines.
It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses.
HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent.
Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring):
All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost.
Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent.
The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities.
Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application.
There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge.
Per Smith J.A. (in dissent):
Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders.
This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion.
In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines.
First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income.
There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion.
Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children.
In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all.
In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis.
Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities.
This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities.
It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense.
The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines.
Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside.
The appellant should have the costs of the appeal."
1003,"Pacific Home Products Ltd. did not receive any response or any communication whatsoever from Mr. Ens post August 31, 2004 and was entitled to assume that their obligations concerning the contract were at an end based on the frustration of the contract and the fact that the parties were unable to agree as to any remedy that would be satisfactory to both parties.","The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home.
They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years.
The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom.
The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom.
This provision was fundamental element in the contract.
The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term.
The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.
 The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit.
The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13.
HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22.
In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs.
Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated.
The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract.
It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party.
The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract.
The event was permanent and non-transient.
The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended.
The difference was much more than mere inconvenience.
The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them.
Both parties acted in good faith.
The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract.
The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities.
The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract.
The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities.
Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss.
The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane.
The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely.
The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project.
Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time."
1004,"ordered: Should Mr. Gavelin not work for the months of April and May, 2007, he shall have additional parenting time with the children every week (other than the weekend he exercises regular access), from Thursday at 4:00 p.m., overnight to Saturday at 10:00 a.m. 18) The petitioner's request that this access provision apply to this year is not so much in the nature of a variation as an extrapolation of the previous order.","FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial.
The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order.
HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.
 The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule.
Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children.
The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order."
1005,"The second issue as to whether Mr. Dubelt would testify and why he did not is contained in the following excerpt from his affidavit: nan At the close of the Crown’s case, was advised by Richard Klassen that did not have to testify as he believed that he would raise reasonable doubt about the Complainant’s evidence and credibility through our expert witness (in audio recording) who would testify that the audio tape was not authentic or continuous, and that my denials of the assaults were recorded on the audio tape. Counsel now argues that once the evidence had been presented by Klassen in relation to the audio tape from legal standpoint it should have been obvious that there was no hope of that defence succeeding, therefore miscarriage of justice has occurred as Klassen’s advice should have then been that Mr. Dubelt had to testify.","The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed.
1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred.
There was no unfairness in the trial process.
The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him.
He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on.
There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant.
He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made.
On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer.
2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant.
The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case.
He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen.
The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen.
The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v. Romanowicz (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.)."
1006,"[11] Section 228 as worded sets out recalculation mechanism for addressing how and when payments to workers injured within the window period would be calculated under the new Act. Counsel for the Board acknowledges that in order for its appeal to succeed, it must show that entitlement to chronic pain benefits involves recalculation within the meaning of s.","The Workers' Compensation Board appealed the effective date of the chronic pain benefits awarded to a worker.
That date had been found on the evidence to be prior to November 2, 1992, which was the date set out in the legislation's transitional provisions (s. 228) dealing with injuries suffered during the 'window period.'
appeal dismissed;
s. 228 has no application to the payment of chronic pain benefits for injuries during the window period as no recalculation of benefits is involved; nor is entitlement under s. 9 of the regulations restricted to an effective date of November 26, 1992."
1007,"In particular, the evidence called by the Crown raised issues regarding the appellant’s mental health, leaving the impression with the court that he suffered from psychiatric illness and would therefore be person more likely to have knowingly uttered threat to Professor Van Bommel. [98] Taking into account all of the circumstances, including the words used; the fact they appeared in an attachment as part of a computer program containing other unusual phrases; there was no animosity between the person who received the attachment, Professor Van Bommel and the appellant; and no reason for the appellant to want to intimidate or provoke Van Bommel, it is equally open to infer that the words had been typed in that file to get a reaction from people that the appellant, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his key strokes, and did not constitute a threat to cause death to Martin Van Bommel, nor can it properly be concluded that the appellant intended to do so.","An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment.
The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.'
Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student.
The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them.
He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor.
Appeal allowed; conviction quashed.
The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility.
The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor."
1008,"But having regard to all the circumstances, where it appears to court that the payor parent has contributed to his/her child's support in way that satisfied his/her obligation, no retroactive support award should be ordered.. In my view, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of Mr. Munro, given the passage of several years since effective notice was first received; the significant level of support he was providing; his reasonable belief that he was meeting his obligations; the efforts he made to determine Ms. Niles claim, to respond to it and to settle it.","The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children.
The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed.
The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed.
His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend.
He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend.
He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain.
The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it.
He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed).
The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier.
She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part).
The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars.
Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application.
The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed.
He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed.
He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend.
While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation.
Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received).
The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years.
While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter.
The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations.
Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father."
1009,"[3] The issue in this unusual case concerns some trees that the Defendant Renouf cut down on the Claimants’ property, by mistake, while allegedly doing a favour for the Defendant Burrows. personally visited the land at the request of the parties and note that there is narrow area of unclear ownership, based on the available evidence, but it is also quite clear that on any view of it, Mr. Renouf was cutting trees on the Claimants’ property.","The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property.
The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend.
As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut.
He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees.
The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field.
At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages.
The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money.
1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages.
That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose.
2. Burrows is not liable.
He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable.
It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do.
Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise.
The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm.
3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help).
While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed.
Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements).
While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial."
1010,"(b) The adjustment of the sale price [93] According to the appellant’s fifth and last ground of appeal, the Committee misconstrued the decisions of the Board of Revision, or ignored evidence, in deciding that the sale of the Victoria Square Mall did not require adjustment pursuant to Document 1.1.6.","This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall.
The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor.
The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board.
The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied.
It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act.
The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination.
The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall.
The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments.
They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee.
They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case.
Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal.
These other appeals are also dismissed."
1011,"The trial judge found that, although the senior Mr. Clement was present at the initial interview when the terms of the contract were explained to the solicitor for the appellant, there was no convincing evidence that the subject of the value of the land was not appropriately and adequately discussed.","This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent.
The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement.
The total price was $120,000.
The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year.
There was no interest.
However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes.
The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened.
The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence.
It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to.
2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract.
It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction.
The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract.
The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract.
If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances.
The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis."
1012,"[9] Notwithstanding that the Plaintiff, Glenn Franklin, signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of Mr. Verklan’s report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting “flat at the corners”.","The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants.
The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect.
HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service.
1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners.
This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned.
Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed.
Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant.
2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded.
This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took.
The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions."
1013,"They can be summarized as follows: (a) Constable Badger’s eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction, (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether, if it was Mr. Holoboff driving the Tempo, he could have outrun Constable Badger at the end of the car chase, (c) an adverse inference should have been drawn from the Crown’s failure to call the officer who was in the police car with Constable Badger, (d) the trial judge’s treatment of the photographs of Mr. Horkoff misled the jury about what had to be proven in order to establish that Mr. Horkoff was driving the Tempo, (e) the jury was improperly led to place particular reliance on an assessment of Mr. Holoboff’s credibility made by an R.C.M.P. officer who questioned him about possible involvement in the grow-op.","The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora.
They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo.
The search revealed marijuana grow-op.
The accused was later seen by officers driving.
The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot.
Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial.
The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial.
He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison.
The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence.
HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.
The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op.
The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility.
The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit."

Counsel: Katharine Grier for the appellant Jennifer Fraser for the respondent Appeal: From: Provincial Court Heard: January 21, 2010 Disposition: Appeal Allowed Oral Reasons: January 21, 2010 By: The Honourable Mr. Justice Cameron for the Court CAMERON J.A. Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code.","Fulltext of judgment follows:
Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code.
The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence.
With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order.
The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.).
In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made.
Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent.
If any directions should be required in relation to the execution of the order, the parties are given leave to informally apply for such directions through the Registrar's office."
1015,review of his notes from the case management shows that Mr. Owens took no issue at this time with the witness list provided by the Crown or with the fact that Sergeant Barbar was not going to be called by the Crown at the preliminary inquiry. [13] Mr. Owens wrote back to the Crown and advised that he was not prepared to simply let this evidence be admitted at the preliminary inquiry without Sergeant Barbar being called as witness.,"Defence sought an adjournment of a preliminary hearing to call a police accident reconstructionist as a witness.
Prior to the commencement of the hearing, defence counsel was aware that the Crown did not intend to call this person as part of its case.
One month prior to the preliminary hearing, defence counsel requested that the accident reconstructionist be made available as witness.
The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission.
The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing.
HELD: The defence request for an adjournment was granted.
The Court could not be satisfied that the officer was not a material witness to the preliminary inquiry.
The Court was not satisfied that defence was guilty of neglect in failing to procure the officer's attendance when they had been advised by the Crown that he was out of the country.
The length of the adjournment would not be lengthy."
1016,"[5] Mr. Merchant also submits that the details and validity of Mr. Field’s personal claim (including whether or not he suffered adverse effects from the use of Paxil) are irrelevant to the common issues; that Mr. Field has already disclosed all of his medical records so that further cross-examination is unnecessary; and, that concern about the suitability of Mr. Field to act as representative plaintiff is the type of issue that every defendant in every proposed class action could put forward as justification for leave to cross-examine.","The plaintiffs have applied for certification of proposed multi-jurisdictional class action involving Paxil, prescription drug approved in Canada for the treatment of depression, anxiety, panic disorder and other conditions.
The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18 years of age.
The defendant applies for leave to cross-examine the representative plaintiff on his affidavit pursuant to Rule 317 of The Queen's Bench Rules.
HELD: The decisions reviewed by the Court all support the view that leave to cross-examine under Rule 317 is granted more readily in proposed class actions than it is in other civil proceedings.
None support the proposition that proposed representative plaintiff is immune from cross-examination in respect of his or her individual claim.
Cross-examination of proposed representative plaintiff may explore matters pertaining to his or her individual claim in the context of issue that must be determined by the court pursuant to s. and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act.
A cross-examination of the plaintiff in this case may assist the court in applying the criterion set out in s. 6 and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act.
The application for leave to cross-examine is granted."

[16] find as fact that Mr. Lawson and Mr. McKay entered into an oral contract for the supply and installation of soffit, facia and eavestroughing.","The defendant contracted with the plaintiff for supply and installation of materials.
The defendant was not satisfied with the plaintiff's work, hired a third party to fix the plaintiff's work and refused to pay the plaintiff.
The plaintiff sued for payment of the outstanding account
HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed.
The Court found enough evidence to conclude that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that there was a breach of the implied condition that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard.
As the plaintiff's workmanship constitutes a breach of contract, the defendant's damages are set off against the claim."
1018,"[3] By notice of motion dated January 28, 2011, the appellants move for a stay of the provisions of the Order requiring that the premises be vacated. As result of the trial judge’s decision, an order was issued on January 18, 2011, requiring the Property to be vacated on or before February 4, 2011, at 12:01 p.m. and enjoining the appellants from re-entering or re-occupying the property for period of 70 days.","The appellants sought a stay pending their appeal of an order made under the Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act requiring them to vacate their home for 70 days.

She can walk to school from this home.
Stay granted, with conditions including a requirement that no one but the appellants, their children and an approved babysitter(s) be at the home between 11 pm and 6 am.
Without a stay, the appellants and their children would suffer irreparable harm.
The potential damage to the children can't be measured in monetary terms and without a stay, the issue would be moot by the time the appeal is heard.

1019,"[2] At the time of sentencing the accused had been in custody on the subject charges for two years and eleven months. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives: (a) to denounce unlawful conduct; (b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences; (c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary; (d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders; (e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and (f) to promote sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.","The accused plead guilty to one count of using credit card data to fraudulently obtain services contrary to s. 342(3) of the Criminal Code, one count of fraud over $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1) of the Criminal Code for defrauding Sasktel of telephone services and one count of fraudulently personating various persons with intent to gain advantage for himself contrary to s. 403(a) of the Criminal Code.
The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences.
The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names.
He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services.
The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44.
The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items.
The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18.
The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail.
He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders.
In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities.
He plead guilty.
HELD: A fit sentence in global terms for these offences would be 8 years and 6 months.
The accused was given credit for 4 years and 9 months for the time he spent in custody.
The accused was sentenced to 2 years and 3 months for the s. 342(3) offence, 1 year and 6 months consecutive for the offence under s. 380(1) and 2 years concurrent for the personation offence under s. 403(a).
The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused.
The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors.
In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea.
The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence."
1020,"v. Hayes, 2007 NSSC 74 (CanLII), 253 N.S.R.(2d) 235, at paragraph 26 for the proposition that trial judge should not rely on conjecture or speculation in order to determine whether an accused was guilty of impaired operation of motor vehicle pursuant to s.","The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations.
The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force.
The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth.
In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath.
The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer.
He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer.
The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses.
The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation.
The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer.
There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility.
The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b).
Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause.
While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment.
The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected.
The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato.
There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict."

1022,"[Reference to authorities omitted] [23] In the circumstances of this case, it has been established beyond reasonable doubt that Knife acted in concert with Raphael, Coutu and Dreaver in the commission of the assault on Dorion. Objectively speaking, there was nothing happening prior to Knife’s decision to attack Dorion, which would lead to the conclusion that the accused reasonably believed, in the circumstances, that he was being unlawfully assaulted.","In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary.
The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon.
second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant.
The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured.
The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant.
None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused.
The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day.
The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code.
HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts.
1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances.
Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate.
Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option.
The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them.
2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge.
Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant.
The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not."
1023,"The complainant says the defendant attacked her and began choking her, and she grabbed his testicles in defence. I find as a fact that during the events at the Coachman Hotel in Regina on February 4, 2011, the defendant threatened to kill the complainant, and the defendant is guilty of this charge.","The complainant and the accused were in relationship and came to Regina where they stayed in hotel, drank, consumed cocaine and shopped.
An argument ensued about missing shopping bag.
The accused was charged with two counts of uttering death threats to the complainant; unlawfully confining the complainant; assault causing bodily harm on the complainant; committing sexual assault on the complainant; breach of recognizance in having contact with the complainant.
At trial, both the complainant and the accused testified as to what transpired during the argument that resulted in the charges.
HELD: 1) The accused was found not guilty of sexual assault.
2) The accused was found guilty of unlawful confinement.
3) The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm.
The Court did not accept the accused's invoking of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code.
The accused admitted to striking the complainant with a closed fist five times as hard as he could and the force used was excessive.
4) The accused was found guilty of threatening to kill the complainant at the hotel.
5) The accused was found guilty of uttering death threats and breach of recognizance by contacting the complainant.
The Court did not accept his testimony and denial."
1024,"[70] As to the external consistency of SG’s evidence, or the extent to which it is consistent with the evidence accepted by me of other witnesses, note: i) Her description of the places she went to school, the places she lived with her family, and her father lived with Mr. H.’s family are generally consistent with the evidence of other witnesses; ii) her description of the sequence of disclosure by her to her first boyfriend K., then to her guidance counsellor, Ms. R., as well as the circumstances of the disclosure are consistent as between herself and K. G., testified that in her opinion, she felt SG was doing this because Mr. H.’s family had discussed moving to where SG’s father would have not have place to stay (and SG was aware of this), and therefore if SG made the allegations, SG’s father would likely come to live with her and her mother; iii) the Crown argued that there was no convincing evidence that SG had motive to lie.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15.
The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details.
He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father.
Accused found guilty of all counts.
Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances.
Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor.
The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end."
1025,"Put simply, Mr. Cretu’s status as Convention refugee and Canada’s non-refoulement obligations do not displace the well-established requirement that court considering an application for judicial interim release in an extradition proceeding must limit the assumption of risk of non-appearance more severely than might otherwise be acceptable in the case of an application for judicial interim release brought by an offender under the Criminal Code.","The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code.
Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him.
The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond.
The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property.
HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous,
the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant.
The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence.
Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada.
The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court.
The application for judicial interim release was dismissed."
1026,"nan IN THE PROVINCIAL COURT OF SASKATCHEWAN YOUTH JUSTICE COURT Citation: 2012 SKPC 161 Date: September 26, 2012 Information: 36654171, 44662780, 44662781 Location: Saskatoon Between: Her Majesty the Queen Appearing: Ms. Dorinda Stahl Counsel for the Crown Ms. Pat Tondevold Counsel for the Defence Note: Sections 110 and 111 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act contain prohibitions against publication of name or other information that would identify someone as either young person being dealt with under the Act, or as child or young person who is victim or witness in relation to an offence alleged under the Act. SENTENCING DECISION D.C. SCOTT, INTRODUCTION [1] N.B.L. has pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated assault thereby endangering the life of Paul Fischer contrary to s.","The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker.
The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle.
The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people.
One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head.
The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat.
The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head.
The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down.
After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley.
The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth.
He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work.
The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision.
At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age.
He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty.
His parents were separated.
He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence.
He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats.
He had served five open custody sentences.
HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence.
The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim.
The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors.
In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court.
The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation.
He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision.
The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused.
A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody.
Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required."
1027,The officer subjectively believed that he had reasonable grounds to arrest the accused for impaired driving and to make demand for breath samples.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08.
He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused.
The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded.
The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk.
The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number.
He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane.
The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane.
The officer activated his emergency equipment.
The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle.
The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle.
The officer did not note smell of alcohol.
HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid.
While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told.
Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused.
In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol.
The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol.
The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality.
In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body.
The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds.
No charter breach was established.
The certificate was not excluded."
1028,"CROWN POSITION [19] The Crown argues that GiO 500 watt E-scooter which Mr. Rookes was operating on February 26, 2010 is motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code and that Mr. Rookes should be convicted of the charges of impaired driving and refusal to provide breath sample.","The accused was charged with two counts being driving while impaired contrary to s. 253(1)(a) and refusal to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code.
The Court had earlier acquitted the accused on the charge of driving while disqualified as there was no evidence regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence.
At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code.
The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it.
HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court.
There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped."
1029,"On January 19, 2012, the Chief Executive Officer of MNP provided notice to arbitrate pursuant to the partnership agreement to the plaintiff.","The defendant seeks a stay of the action pursuant to s. 8 of The Arbitration Act.
The plaintiff is chartered accountant who was partner with the defendant.
2000 merger agreement signed by the plaintiff indicated that the Courts of Saskatchewan would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine all disputes between the parties.
After the merger, the plaintiff signed new partnership agreement that said arbitration would apply to any disputes between partner and the partnership.
HELD: The action was stayed pending arbitration.
The plaintiff's statement of claim does not rely on the 2000 merger agreement, the claim is based solely on the new partnership agreement and alleges breaches of the partnership agreement.
The partnership agreement clearly states that disputes are to be resolved through arbitration."
1030,"November 28, 2012 [1] The defendant has applied pursuant to Rule 41(2) of the Queen’s Bench Rules for an order that this action and Tsatsi v. (1996), 1996 CanLII 7100 (SK QB), 150 Sask.R. 292, [1996] S.J. No. 732 (QL) (Sask.Q.B.): 11 It is trite law that the joinder of parties and actions is permitted for the two basic related policy reasons that underlie many civil procedural rules: economy and justice.","The defendant applied pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 169 for leave to amend his Statement of Defence.
This is a defamation action and the amendment would add that the words spoken by the defendant were true and that the alleged defamation was justified in law.
The action relates to statements made about the plaintiff's failure to properly read an X-ray and his failure to pass certain certification exams and that health officials knew that he should not be performing the work he was doing.
There is another defamation action, described in this judgment as the College Action.
The defendant applied pursuant to Rule 41(2) that his action and the College Action be tried together because there are common issues of fact between the two, albeit different actions.
 Trying them together would be in the interests of judicial economy and avoid the possibility of conflicting findings.
HELD: The Court ordered that the two actions be tried one immediately after the other in the manner determined by the trial judge and that the defendant be given leave to amend his Statement of Defence."
1031,"They raised the following grounds in their proposed notice of appeal: 4(a) the learned chambers judge erred in law in failing to find that the relationship between the Respondent (Plaintiff) and the class members (collectively the ""Respondent"") and McMillan did not fall within category within which existing precedent recognizes duty of care owed by lawyer to non-client; 4(b) the judge erred in law in failing to properly apply the Anns test, in particular: (i) The judge erred in law by conflating foreseeability with proximity in the first leg of the Anns [[1977] All E.R. 492 (U.K.H.L.)] test; and (ii) the judge erred in law by failing to consider and apply the policy considerations which may preclude or negate the finding of duty of care, under the second leg of the Anns test; 4(c) the judge erred in law by relying upon expert evidence as to the standard of care to find that duty of care may be owed by McMillan to non-clients such as the Respondent; 4(d) the judge erred in fact and in law in finding that “the full extent of the conversations between Mr. Friedman and Mr. Scott are not before me, but are proper subject for evidence at trial…” when there was no conflict between the affidavits of Messrs.","The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan.
The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan.
McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website.
The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency.
The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence.
McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client.
Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors.
The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors.
The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act.
HELD: The Court dismissed the applications.
It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious.
The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case.
McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client.
The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class.
McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence.
These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act."
1032,"Income was imputed to the respondent in the amount of $177,000 and he was ordered to pay $2,589 per month in child support. Using the respondent’s imputed income of $109,000 and the dates upon which Mandela and Bogani ceased to be children of the marriage, it is possible to calculate the amount of child support owed by the respondent: July 1, 2001 June 30, 2002: (although the order was issued in March, 2001, it was not effective until July 1, 2001).","The parties had three children during their marriage.
After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000.
The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it.
She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support.
The parties were regularly in court.
In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic.
His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001.
In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001.
He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage.
His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years.
The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia.
HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively.
With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage.
The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000.
Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300.
The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000.
The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears.
The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001.
The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears.
The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927."
1033,"Crown counsel, in sentencing submissions, suggested that Mr. Michelin’s criminal record establishes pattern of sexual assaults. R. 51 where the accused, with prior record including two assault convictions, fondled and digitally penetrated the victim and refused to stop until the victim pretended to cooperate was sentenced to 20 months incarceration which sentence took into account the accused having served part of the conditional sentence imposed by the lower court.","HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault.
The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats.
The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability.
The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years.
The sentences were to be served concurrently."
1034,"[32] Having found solicitor-client relationship arose and that the new retainer for Pearce-Ell was sufficiently related to the matters involving the Holgates, both Martin and C.N.R., indicate that, as matter of law, it must be presumed the lawyers at the Phillips Co. law firm possessed confidential information.","HELD: The Court granted the application.
It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants.
That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff."
1035,"[10] In response, the Crown argues that an in-court identification of the accused is not necessary; it is sufficient that the individual with whom the police officer dealt has surrendered to the Court as demonstrated through the Appearance Notice. v. Keenan, 2012 QBCA 28, where the accused provided his name and address to the police officer by way of driver’s licence and the Court held that evidence was inadmissible without proof of voluntariness.","The Crown found the accused not guilty.
With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address.
The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary.
Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth.
That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice.
Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present.
All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity.
Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice.
However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel.
Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence.
There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed."
1036,First Claim [41] The plaintiffs’ first claim is that the CÉF’s decision not to grant Trystan Lawless permanent permission to attend École de Bellegarde “discriminated against him as person with disability” and that the other Lawless children were “effectively collateral damage of the attack on Trystan”.,"Civil Procedure Injunction
HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal.
While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted.
Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code.
With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog.
That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit.
The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable.
Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed.
The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction."
1037,"They are as follows: (a) Did the trial judge err in determining there were not reasonable grounds for Cst. Kowalenko's suspicion that Mr. Plantje had alcohol in his body? [37] Turning to the evaluation of the correctness of the trial judge's decision regarding the reasonableness of the suspicion, this Court's task is to determine whether reasonable person, standing in the shoes of Cst. Kowalenko, would reasonably suspect Mr. Plantje had alcohol in his body, knowing the following constellation of circumstances: a.","The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard.
The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met.
The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on.
The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning.
The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent.
The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission.
A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time.
It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent.
The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body.
An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol.
Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered."
1038,"THE PAYMENT OF PURCHASE MONIES INTO COURT [11] The draft order sets out the following proposal for disbursing the purchase monies: AND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the purchase monies shall be applied disbursed as follows: (a) firstly, to the property taxes outstanding on the mortgaged premises to the date of sale; (b) secondly, to any real estate commission payable; (c) thirdly, to the reasonable and actual property maintenance and utility costs incurred by the Plaintiff to the date of sale; (d) fourthly, to costs incurred by the Plaintiff in this action on solicitor and client basis to be taxed; (e) fifthly, to the Plaintiff for application toward the amounts owing to the Plaintiff herein as directed by this Honourable Court on application to confirm the sale; and (f) lastly, if any sale funds remain that the funds be paid into this Honourable Court and disbursed by further order of the Court on application by any of the remaining interested parties.","The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi.
It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price.
Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000.
If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs.
Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff.
Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application.
All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful."
1039,12 of the defendants’ brief of law for summary judgment): (d) The Plaintiffs have led no evidence that: (i) The Plaintiffs personally were misled in any way by the “low sodium” label; (ii) Any consumers were misled as to any of the attributes of the PC Low Sodium Beverages (as opposed to the relative attributes of competing products); (iii) The Plaintiffs relied upon the “low sodium” representation when purchasing the PC Low Sodium Beverages; or (iv) The Plaintiffs have suffered any damages.,"HELD: The court granted summary judgment for the defendants.
It held that it could determine the defendants’ application prior to the plaintiffs’ application for certification.
The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages.
The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence.
There was no genuine issue requiring a trial.
The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them.
It was not necessary to decide the application for certification."
1040,"67 of The Legal Profession Act, 1990, SS 1990-91, L-10.1 [Act] for an assessment of all bills for legal services that Brabant and Company Law Office [Brabant] rendered to Cowessess within six years of the date of the application. Where overcharging is alleged, the full particulars of the alleged overcharging must be set out, including specific reference as to what charges in the solicitor's bill are excessive or in breach of the terms of the solicitor's retainer; Application [16] As with Salyne, will apply the relevant criteria here in order to ascertain whether Cowessess’ request is fair and whether the extension of the 30 day time period in which to order the assessment that they request is in the interests of justice.","HELD: The application was dismissed.
The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice.
The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files.
The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client.
The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years.
Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid.
The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances.
The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated."
1041,"[23] The appeal court judge then determined the trial judge had made number of errors as follows: (a) he transformed the subjective and objective aspects of the proportional inquiry into purely objective test; (b) once he accepted that Constable Power subjectively believed that his use of force was reasonable, the trial judge should have inquired whether the Crown had proven beyond reasonable doubt the absence of any reasonable grounds for that subjective belief or, put another way, whether there was any doubt that reasonable person in the situation of Constable Power might have used the force actually employed; (c) his approach caused him to assess the correctness of Constable Power’s subjective belief in the reasonableness of the force used and, as consequence, no allowance was made for the prospect that his subjective belief might have been mistaken; (d) his objective approach caused him to disregard the evidence of the expert witness, Mr. Johnston, as to whether the use of force was carried out in accordance with police training, given the predicament Constable Power was in and the strategies available to extricate himself; and (e) by considering the distance between Constable Power and Mr. Stonechild, the disparity in their strength, agility, fitness and an array of options with lesser force, he weighed to nicety the force of Constable Power’s response to Mr. Stonechild’s impending attack.","HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge.
The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable.
The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief.
The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do.
The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal.
The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety.
He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole.
The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal.
The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred.
The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force.
The respondent had to react quickly.
The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm."
1042,"believe and conclude in this case that Ms. Buchanan and other workers directed Ms. Bigsky that Mr. Lerat was not to be in the home, but that this direction was not made part of any parental services agreement or other court order applicable to Ms. Bigsky. [39] The result is that I must conclude that Corporal Mickleborough did not have any lawful authority to enter Ms. Bigsky’s apartment suite to effect and arrest of Justin Lerat.","HELD: The accused was found not guilty.
The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached.
Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home.
The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search.
The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit.
The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home.
There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house.
The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights.
The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children.
The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights.
The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence."
1043,"In this instance, after Constable Erickson arrested the accused (5:37 a.m.) the police vehicle remained at the scene for 35 minutes before proceeding to the police station (6:12 a.m.).","HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice.
The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it;
and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained.
However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained.
The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately.
The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code."
1044,"In addition to the statutory conditions, those conditions are that Ms. Fellner: (i) report forthwith, and no later than 4 p.m. March 1, 2016 to a probation officer and thereafter at the times and places directed by the probation officer;  (ii) reside at a residence approved by the Probation Officer and not change that address without the permission of the Probation Officer;  (iii) make and maintain any appointments with an addictions counsellor as directed by the Probation Officer;  (iv) participate in any addictions assessment, programming or education, including in-patient and out-patient treatment, as directed by the Probation Officer and not give cause to be dismissed from any treatment program to which referred;  (v) provide proof of attendance at appointments or treatment as requested by the Probation Officer;  (vi) attend and participate in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings on a regular basis and no less than twice per week except with prior permission of your Probation Officer;  (vii) provide your consent to AA to release proof of attendance at AA meetings;  (viii) at the direction and request of the probation officer provide proof of attendance at AA meetings;  (viii) not to have, possess, keep or consume alcohol or enter any licenced premises where the main purpose is the sale or consumption of alcohol;    (x) submit, on demand of a peace officer, without reasonable grounds, to supply a breath sample in order to determine compliance with this order; and  (xi) attend and participate in any personal counselling including psychological or psychiatric treatment as directed by the Probation Officer.","HELD: The accused was granted a curative discharge.
The court found that the accused had met the required onus of this type of application in accordance with R. v. Ahenakew.
The accused’s conduct over the past 18 months satisfied the court on the balance of probabilities that hers was an exceptional case and that a curative discharge would not be contrary to the public interest.
The court imposed numerous conditions on her, including that she could not have or consume alcohol and should report to a probation officer, receive addiction counselling, participate in AA meetings and provide proof of her attendance to her probation officer.
Her driver’s license was cancelled and she was prohibited from driving for two years."
1045,"After the death of the mother, the grandmother’s home has continued to be the primary residence for the children with the father commencing visits with the children in May 2015. The oldest child, Arty, had been at that school before when the mother and two children were living with the grandmother after the mother’s separation from the father.","HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent.
They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends.
The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support."
1046,"718 of the Criminal Code, including, in particular, denunciation and deterrence, both the aggravating and mitigating factors associated with this tragic occurrence, the principles of parity and totality and the voices of all of the victims involved in this matter, I sentence you with regard to Count No. 1, namely, dangerous driving causing the death of Justin Gaja, to a term of imprisonment of three years to be served in a federal institution.","The accused was found guilty of three counts of dangerous driving causing death, contrary to s. 249(4) of the Criminal Code, and one count of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, contrary to s. 249(3) of the Code.
During his employment as professional truck driver, the accused had driven into construction zone on highway and hit another vehicle that had been stopped.
The three teenage occupants of the vehicle were killed and flag person was severely injured as result of the collision.
The accused was sure that he had not been asleep at the time of the accident but felt that he had not been paying attention.
He had not noticed any of the signs posted at 100-metre intervals after the start of the construction zone 1.6 km south of the accident.
The accused was 41 years of age.
He had obtained his A-1 driver’s licence in 2009 and had clean driving abstract.
He was married and had three children.
He had recently been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea.
He expressed remorse to the victim’s families and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.|
HELD: The accused was sentenced to three years in imprisonment on the first count and three years concurrent for the second and third counts, and one year concurrent to the other counts on the fourth count.
He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment.
The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person.
The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families.
The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone.
The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse.
He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record.
The accused was at low risk to re-offend."
1047,"(2) Subject to section 22, where, having regard to the matters mentioned in subsection (3), the court is satisfied that it would be unfair and inequitable to make an equal distribution of family property or its value, the court may: (a) refuse to order any distribution; (b) order that all the family property or its value be vested in one spouse; or (c) make any other order that it considers fair and equitable (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the court shall have regard to the following: (a) any written agreement between the spouses or between one or both spouses and third party; (b) the length of time that the spouses have cohabited; (c) the duration of the period during which the spouses have lived separate and apart; (d) the date when the family property was acquired; (e) the contribution, whether financial or in some other form, made directly or indirectly by third party on behalf of spouse to the acquisition, disposition, operation, management or use of the family property; (f) any direct or indirect contribution made by one spouse to the career or career potential of the other spouse; (g) the extent to which the financial means and earning capacity of each spouse have been affected by the responsibilities and other circumstances of the spousal relationship; (h) the fact that spouse has made: (i) substantial gift of property to third party; or (ii) transfer of property to third party other than bona fide purchaser for value; (i) previous distribution of family property between the spouses by gift or agreement or pursuant to an order of any court of competent jurisdiction made before or after the coming into force of this Act or The Miscellaneous Statutes (Domestic Relations) Amendment Act, 2001 (No. 2); (j) tax liability that may be incurred by spouse as result of the transfer or sale of family property or any order made by the court; (k) the fact that spouse has dissipated family property; (l) subject to subsection 30(3), any benefit received or receivable by the surviving spouse as result of the death of his or her spouse; (m) any maintenance payments payable for the support of child; (n) interests of third parties in the family property; (o) any debts or liabilities of spouse, including debts paid during the course of the spousal relationship; (p) the value of family property situated outside Saskatchewan; (q) any other relevant fact or circumstance.","HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband.
The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father.
It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other.
The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him.
There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse.
Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy.
2) The husband had professional corporation.
His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received.
His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings.
Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability.
The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses.
It was not appropriate to impute income to her.
She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada.
Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order.
There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support.
3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon.
The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife.
Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names.
The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations.
The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home.
4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support.
The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career.
The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support.
However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines.
Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate.
The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support.
5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period."
1048,"[21] According to Cst. Howell’s testimony, the warrant was originally sought to obtain the internet search history of this accused with respect to specific website called Plenty of Fish and also websites generally dealing with massage pornography. Rather, it appears, from the weight of all of the evidence that what they intended to do, in the case of both Sgt. Kuan and Cst. Logan, was to search for and obtain, if available, evidence of the accused’s computer having on it child pornography.","HELD: The application was allowed in part and the balance of images found on the computer were excluded from the evidence at trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.
The court found that the evidence found through temporary Internet sites was admissible.
The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer.
The police had no authority to search the computer generally.
They were only authorized to look at the Internet history.
The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right.
The temporary files created as a result of the visits on the Internet was evidence of Internet history, and because of this connection, this evidence was not excluded."
