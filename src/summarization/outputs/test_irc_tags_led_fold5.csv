He used his position of authority as police chief to commit the crimes. The offender did not have a criminal record. The offences were premeditated, and directed against trusting and well-intentioned organizations. Sentencing the offender to four months consecutive imprisonment on each count, for a total of twenty months, and ordering restitution to the victims,  that the sentence must serve as a message of deterrence to all individuals who hold positions of trust and authority. This message is particularly important to police officers, whose integrity must be beyond reproach.","The accused, 43 years of age, and a former Chief of Police for the Town of Kentville, pleaded guilty to five theft related charges. The total amount of money involved for all five counts exceeds $64,000. He was sentenced to four months consecutive on each count for a total of twenty months incarceration in a provincial institution. restitution was ordered for the five victims in the amounts as detailed in Exhibit 3. The accused was 43 years old and a police officer. He used his position of authority as police chief to commit theft against a fund for a worthy cause. In addition, he was a former member of the Kentville Police force and had a lengthy criminal record. He had no criminal record and had been industrious throughout his lifetime. His plea had saved the administration of justice an incredible amount of time, effort and money. His sentence must serve as a message of deterrence to all individuals holding positions of authority."
b_2014skqb81.txt,"Limitation of Actions – Mortgage – Saskatchewan Farmland SecurityHELD: When s. 12 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act was enacted it was the legislature’s intention that a mortgagee, to whom The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act applied, could suspend the limitation period clock from running and after serving a notice of intention to enforce its security, provided that within three years of such service the mortgagee made application to the court for an order under s. 11 permitting it to commence an enforcement action. If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again. The notice of extension in this case expired in 2009 and the limitation clock began to run again. The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce the respondent’s mortgage has expired and the registration of the mortgage is ordered discharged.","The applicant asks that the registration of mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired. The respondent says the limitation time has not expired because The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, S.S. 1988-89, c. S-17.1 (the “Farm Security Act”) provides for a suspension of limitation time running while certain proceedings are underway pursuant to that Act. HELD: 1) The notice of extension having expired on February 28, 2009, the limitation clock began to run again. Given the time period has substantially expired before the service of the initial notice of intention, once the clock began running again it expired within the day. 2) The registration of the mortgage must be ordered discharged as requested. 3) The Registrar be directed to discharge Interest Register No. 106597705 from title to the property legally described as follows: Surface Parcel #131038905 Reference Land Description: SW Sec 36, Twp 43, Rge 08, W3 Extension As described on Certificate of Title 77B11021; and 4) The applicant shall have the taxable costs of her application against the respondent."
3_1997canlii15044.txt,"The applicant sought approval of the Court for a settlement reached on behalf of the infant plaintiff, who had been injured in an automobile accident. Part of the order sought provided for the payment of solicitor fees by way of a contingency fee agreement negotiated with the applicant. The contingency fee agreement was never filed with the prothonotary. Granting the order relating to the settlement amount, but setting aside the contingency fee agreement, that Civil Procedure Rule 63.19(1) requires that all contingency fee agreements be filed with the prothonotary. As this was not done, the applicant's solicitor is only entitled to compensation as would have been payable in the absence of the contingency agreement.","An infant was waiting for a school bus to pick him up outside the school. The bus pulled away suddenly causing some of the children to lose their balance. The infant fell to the ground and immediately felt the bus run over the lower half of his right leg. No surgery was required and the infant was advised to return to pre-accident activities. The wording in Civil Procedure 63.19(1) requires that the filing of the Agreement with the Prothonotary is mandatory because of the use of the word'shall'. This was not done in this case. As the Agreement does not comply with the rules, the solicitor is only entitled to compensation 'as would have been payable in the absence of any contingency arrangement and without regard to the contingency.' This means the Contingency Fee Agreement is out."
9_2014skqb386.txt,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction, arguing that the roadside demand had not been made forthwith and that whether or not the accused had consumed beer within fifteen minutes of taking the roadside test was pure speculation. The trial judge found that the appellant rebutted the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) that the person who occupies the driver’s seat is deemed to have care or control of the vehicle. He found that even if he was wrong in concluding that the accused did not provide evidence to the contrary so as to rebut the presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused."
d_2001nsca44.txt,"The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol. The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial. Finally, there were no errors by the judge on any of the other grounds advanced for appeal.","Following a trial in the Supreme Court, before Justice Simon MacDonald and a jury, the appellant was convicted of four offences arising out of her operation of a motor vehicle. The appellant appeals her conviction and raises numerous grounds of appeal. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The appellant's conviction is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 2) The Court found that the appellant's right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter, had been violated. 3) There was no medical reason to keep the appellant at the hospital."
5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.","The students' union applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act pursuant to s. 222(d) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The students' Union sought to overturn that order. The Chambers judge dismissed the application and found that the president of the Students' Union had no standing to bring his application and made errors in his approach to the application. HELD: The appeals were dismissed with costs. 1)The president was not a proper person to bring the application as per s. 225 of the Act. He attended the University from the fall of 2000 to the spring of 2006 and served term as member-at-large on the Student Union's Student Affairs Board. He was involved in the referendum campaign and a leading voice against joining the Federation. 2)The Chambers judge made no recommendations as to the reasons for his decision. 3)It is not necessary to work through the merits of these arguments because, regardless of how they might play out, the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by Mr. Mowat and others about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. The reality is that over 44% of the students who had opposed joining the federation voted against joining it."
c_2005skqb166.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). An initial question was whether the trial judge's decision quoted above reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for impaired driving. HELD: The entry of a judicial stay on the.08 charge was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue. The judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. Volume of consumption falls within the provisions of s. 253(b). The mechanism for doing so is the entering of judicial stays on the charge that is less serious when convicting of the more serious. The trial judge concluded however that the erratic driving pattern, his unsteadiness and fumbling, coupled with his admissions and the odour of alcohol were matters which, if accepted by a properly instructed finder of facts, could have resulted in conviction. An error in law could result in an acquittal."
4_1996canlii6841.txt,"The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","Husky Oil appealed a decision of the Revenue and Financial Services Board which upheld the assessment of sales tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision reversed. 1)The Board found that the purchase of the drawings was an independent transaction and was exempt from tax by virtue of s. 8(1)(f) of the Act. 2)The issue raised by Husky on the appeal was the interpretation adopted by the Board of the word 'published' as used in s. 5(1(b) of Reg. 1 when defining the word ""books"". If, as the Board found, the purchase did not pay tax on what is referred to asDocumentation charges, was it exempt from taxing by virtue thereof? 3)The evidence before the Board on this matter was evidence which could support either interpretation of the Board's definition. There was not an absence of evidence such that the Board could not reasonably reach the conclusion which it did. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly."
2011skca19.txt,"The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown appealed the conviction of assaulting the complainant with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The judge of the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan found the complainant guilty of assault and granted him a conditional discharge with a probation period of 9 months. The Crown appealed. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1) The trial judge did not fall into the trap of preferring the evidence of one over the other, but rather drew conclusions regarding what happened based on the whole of the evidence. The Court granted leave and allowed the appeal in judgment from the bench. 2) The Court reviewed the trial judgment and found that the trial judge erred in both ways. The appellant's reasons do not reflect an inconsistency. 3) With respect to the first issue, the appeal judge found that even if Cst. Lariviere's mistake of fact had been reasonable, he would have rejected the defence of self-defence on the basis that the use of pepper spray was not proportionate response. 4) There was no inconsistency in the appellant's statement that the finger incident occurred twice, which formed the basis for him to find that the instruction to leave the yard also occurred twice. 5) The appellant did not err in his reasons. He engaged in classical alternative reasoning. He did not address the complainant's assessment of the options available to him in the context of what he was facing. Instead, he focused on the fact there were two officers present. 6) The appeal judge concluded that the appellant had been operating under a reasonable error of fact and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. 7) The Appeal judge reviewed the evidence on a whole and found it did not appear to be inconsistent with the Crown's reasons."
e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","This is an appeal by the City of Regina and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 from a decision dated October 10, 2003, of Roger J. LePage, sitting as a Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The City and CUPE have met their duty to accommodate with respect to Mr. Kivela as an employee of the City. The fact that the City has had number of truck driver positions over the years, usually referred to in the Collective Bargaining Agreement as an Operator II, has resulted in an increase in the number of temporary positions available to the applicant. 2) The applicant was a casual employee for 16 years and remained casual throughout his 16 years with the city. He was denied permanent employment and was kept on casual status for 15 years, which was highly unusual for him. The applicant received 4% less in wages than other comparable City employees because of his disability. The requirement of building up seniority as a Labourer presented an insurmountable barrier for the applicant because he was only guaranteed the right to drive a truck while actually at work. The City was responsible for harassment against the applicant for the 16 years he was employed with the City and was awarded the amount of $8,902.00. 3) The court found that the applicant had reasonable grounds to believe the City discriminated against him in regard to employment because he had a Cerebral Palsy. His efforts to convince the City to give him a permanent position were endless. He accessed work opportunities that were not available to him because the entry-level position was something he could not do because of the entry level position. For example, for the first three or four years was paid $5.00 less per hour than others doing the same job, even though people who started after him moved on to permanent positions. There was no evidence that he turned down work other than truck driving at a time when there was no truck driving for him because he did not want to or was otherwise unavailable. There is no evidence to support this conclusion. 4) The evidence from the applicant and the City is clear that the appellant has a reasonably accurate understanding of the circumstances of his employment and the reasons for his resignation from his employment as a truck driver."

2003skqb550.txt,"The respondent seeks an order prohibiting the petitioner from removing her son from Saskatchewan until she obtains a Court order allowing her to do so. The child is the petitioner's son from a prior relationship. The petitioner plans to have the child live with his biological father in Edmonton so that he can get the specialized medical care that he requires. When the petitioner and the respondent separated, they consented to a judgment, which granted the petitioner custody of the child and gave access rights to the respondent. The consent judgment provided that the petitioner was to provide the respondent with 90 days notice of any proposed change in the child's residence. Notice of the upcoming move was provided to the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. The consent judgment does not require the petitioner to get an order before changing the child's residence.

The order provided that when the husband retired, the wife would receive, as her vested share of his pension, 40% of his benefit. The order also provided that the parties could apply for further directions as necessary. After the husband's retirement, the wife sought to receive her share of the pension from the employer as a lump sum. The husband objected, claiming that he was entitled to any remaining benefit from her share in the event she should predecease him. The wife applied for directions.

She is also entitled to leave her interest in the pension to a named beneficiary, without reference to or the consent of the husband.","The parties married in 1952 and were divorced in 1984. The matrimonial property was settled by the parties in 1985.

(c) on her death the plan would be converted to lump sum payment or continues as monthly payments. Whether this is converted to monthly payments is exclusively the concern of the university and the applicant; and (d) the 40% share, having vested in the applicant, was a share she may deal with without reference to,or the consent of, the university.

Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's application was an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her current circumstances. The proper remedy would be for the applicant to apply for a termination of the order under s. 48 of the Children and Family Services Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of a judge of the Family Court declining to rescind an order in 1993 for permanent care and custody of the appellant's granddaughter. The basis on which the application was made was that the appellant consented to or agreed with the 1993 order on the faith of the agency's then plan of care which envisaged that an adoption plan would be initiated by the appellant. Unfortunately, the agency lost confidence in the child's parenting skills and by June 1995 was hospitalized. The appellant's husband reported the problem to the agency it sought intervention because he alone could not care for the child. He sought rescission of the order in question on the authority of Civil Procedure Rules 15.07 and 15.08. The procedure adopted by the respondent was an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of the past circumstances of [the child] rather than an assessment of her present circumstances.

Expert evidence was given based on blood samples taken after the accident that the accused was impaired; this opinion was based on two assumptions, namely, that the accused had not consumed alcohol within half an hour of the accident, nor after the accident. The Crown did not offer any evidence to prove these assumptions and, in fact, there was a three hour period prior to the accident where there was no evidence of what the accused, who did not testify, was doing. Acquitting the accused, that the expert evidence cannot be tendered by the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had been impaired. The remainder of the evidence against the accused was insufficient to prove the accused's doubt beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with criminal negligence causing death contrary to s.220 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of both counts. 1)The Court held that the proof of impairment consists of observations of conduct in most cases and where the conduct is slight departure from normal behaviour, it would be unsafe to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the pattern of alcohol intake is a slight impairment of one's ability to operate a motor vehicle. 2)The accused's condition contributed to the smallest degree to the death of the victim. 3)The evidence of impairment was so frail as to leave the trial judge with no probative value."
3_1999skqb140.txt,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","At issue was whether the defendant had an obligation to the plaintiff, either in contract or equity for the lease payments on the vehicles and for the repairs to them for the period from September 1993 until February 11, 1994. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The facts did not satisfy the court on a balance of probabilities that this was an appropriate circumstance for an award in favour of the plaintiff based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.  2)The plaintiff's claim with respect to the unpaid repairs against the defendant, Hyndman, has not been proven and that portion of the claim is also dismissed. 3)There was no evidence of any breach of contract between the parties. The plaintiff's evidence did not establish that the defendant was aware of the risk to the arrangement because of Standard's insolvency and that Redhead might not be paid on the leases. It is clear from Cox's notes and Duda's evidence that he did not know how the repairs were authorized."

The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff. In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs. There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict. The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct. The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal. The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause. HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed. The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct. There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance. The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract. Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed. Although the plaintiff had been treated unfairly, the plaintiff had not shown that the employer was guilty of harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious conduct.",HELD: The plaintiff was awarded damages for wrongful dismissal.

e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","HELD: The court found that the holding of trial was a more efficient and cheaper method of coming to a conclusion regarding the issue of maintenance than ongoing negotiation or pre-trial. The court ordered that the respondent father be responsible for 56 percent of s. expenses, which, by agreement of the parties, consist of non-subsidized childcare and any health and medical costs in excess of $100 per annum. The Court ordered that if the respondent had overpaid child maintenance to this date, he may offset the overpayment against future maintenance payments but only to the extent of $50 per month so that the maintenance actually paid will not drop below $518.00 per month."

An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention. Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs. It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","FIAT. The defendant was in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for trust funds.

It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction.

These remedies were available only through the Federal Court.","The applicants brought an application for writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, seeking unconditional release from the Riverbend Minimum Institution due to a threat to their respective liberties claiming that the Correctional Service of Canada has violated their rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in not allowing them to reside in a common housing unit so that they can participate in their long-standing, same-sex relationship outside of the public domain. HELD: The application was granted. The remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process and are not for the Court to determine the reasonableness of the administrative decisions made by the correctional service of Canada within the confines of its jurisdiction. Habeas corpus cannot be used to review the decision of the Correctional Services of Canada declining a housing reassignment request or the policy that all inmates found in housing unit other than their own will be subject to disciplinary charges. These remedies fall outside the exclusive territory of the federal court through a review process. The Court's jurisdiction to grant remedies against federal institutions and decision-makers is narrow. It is not for this court to determine whether the reasons for the agency's decisions are within its confines.HELD: 1) The applicants are seeking to challenge administrative decisions which do not impact their residual liberty. While the applicants have framed their application under the pretence of habas corpus, the true character of the remedies being sought by them is a writ of certioraris, prohibition or mandamus, which is a declaration of jurisdiction in the jurisdiction of Queen's Bench Rule 2-34 of the Queen’s Bench Rules requiring that party with a disability be represented by a lawyer. 2) The Court had concluded that it must decline its jurisdiction in granting a remedy on the application guised as a habea corpus application. 3) The court was not in a position to determine if the reasonsableness were within its jurisdiction, as the applicants had not followed the Offender Complaint and Grievance System and neither had filed a first-level grievance. The court assumes that neither of the applicants’ situations have changed for the purpose of rendering this decision."
d_1991canlii4237.txt,"In this divorce action the petitioner sought to have a separation agreement entered into by the parties incorporated into the corollary relief judgment. The respondent sought to have the separation agreement set aside on the grounds of duress, undue influence or unconscionsability. The couple had a traditional marriage. The petitioner earned $48,000 per year. The wife did not work outside the home and suffered from severe arthritis. For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","The parties entered into a separation agreement which provided for the maintenance of their matrimonial home. The agreement stipulated that the husband would be solely responsible for the overdraft and loan of $5,000 and that the wife would be responsible for any other debts, including the charge accounts at the Bay, Sears and Eatons. The court found that there were no factors that had been established under s. 13 of the Matrimonial Property Act to warrant an order varying the terms of the contract or agreement as the court saw fit.

This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found. 4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages. A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues. 5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case.","This was an application by the defendants for an order pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction severing the issues of liability and damages.

The Court held that no jury, after discharge, could be reconstituted some time later to carry on with the second part of the trial. This would require, an examination of the injuries and how they sustained. Such an examination would be necessary to establish the origin of the accident and the causation of the damages. It would also require the plaintiffs to establish their causal origin and causation. 1)The Court reviewed the medical evidence filed by the solicitors for the plaintiffs as result of the order of Goldenberg J. 2) and held that the issue of liability in favour of the defendants was irrelevant to the plaintiffs' application to sever the issues. 3)No jury could be brought back to assess damages. 4)If the issues were severed, it was at least arguable that the plaintiffs may well be disowned from their rights to have their medical opinion be replicated in a court of law."

Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue.

The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.","The accused was charged with seven counts related to his conviction under s. 13(1) of the Fisheries Act for exceeding the angling limit. At the close of the Crown's case, defence brought a Charter application challenging the constitutionality of s. 35 of The Fisheries Act, 1994, alleging it breaches s. 11(d) and the Canadian Charter of Rights.

Nor was he served by registered mail, in which case it would take effect on the delivery date or on the date the signed post office receipt was returned to the sender. 2)The accused did possess a fishing licence, valid on its face.

It purports to revoke the accused's licence and prohibit him from applying for or obtaining a licence because of a specific conviction.

The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary an order for maintenance for her daughters. She also applied for determination that the father was in arrears of maintenance and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Even if the circumstances as a whole were construed as a unilateral withdrawal by the daughters, the high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been found to be clearly wrong. 2) The court found that the trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in determining that the girls were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The quality of the parent/child relationship by itself rarely determines the matter. The Court found that it would not be just and equitable to require the father to pay the $26,730.54."
d_2018skpc6.txt,"HELD: On the basis of the evidence presented by the parties’ experts and in absence of an express term in the contract, the court read in an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price and awarded the plaintiff such portion of the amount sought as was fair and reasonable. The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work.","The plaintiff entered into an oral agreement with the defendant in which it agreed to provide, on a 'call out' basis, repair services for the defendant's fleet of trucks and associated equipment. When required, it would also provide shop supplies and parts to effect those services. During the relationship, the defendant paid the plaintiff's invoices as they were presented, but ceased to pay as they became due. Eventually, the plaintiff demanded payment of its outstanding invoice and the defendant offered a much smaller sum of money in satisfaction of accounts. HELD: A fair and reasonable price to be paid for the goods and services provided by the plaintiff to the defendant for the period of time for which the plaintiff went unpaid equates to $10,902.32. The plaintiff argued that there was no express term in the contract which stipulated a price for goods, or services, or an implied term to the effect that the parties agreed to charge, and pay a fair price for those goods and/or services. The court found no convincing evidence of detriment reliance on the part of the plaintiff that the defendant had not complied with its obligation to pay in accordance with these terms."
c_1996canlii5370.txt,"This was an application by the defendants to set aside a default judgment entered against them by the plaintiff. Although a statement of claim was served on the defendant, it's insurer was advised by the plaintiff's counsel that she would not proceed to judgment except on 10 days written notice. More than six months later plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to the defendant's insurer giving 10 days notice. This letter was not seen by him although he was in the process of putting together material for a solicitor to file a defence. The defendant had always advised the plaintiff that it intended to defend. No Notice of Intention, required for default judgment if six or more months had elapsed since the last step in the proceeding, was ever given to the defendant before the filing of the default judgment. Allowing the application and setting aside the default judgment, that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse on the part of the defendant for not filing the defence. Sending a letter to the insurer does not satisfy the requirement of filing a Notice of Intention to proceed. The fact that the prothonotary did not object to the request for default judgment without the Notice is immaterial.","This was an application pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06 for an order setting aside the default judgment entered against the Town of Mahone Bay on February 7, 1996.

Dismissing the application, that a default judgment is a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse for not filing the defence.

e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.",HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The chambers judge did not make a palpable and overriding error nor did he err in law and his conclusion was supported by the evidence before him. There was no basis to interfere with the decision of the chambers judge.
c_2002skqb508.txt,"A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of food services at the University of Saskatchewan. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties failed. The employer advised the Board that it was not prepared to make the agreement retroactive. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)The employer sought an order setting aside the orders of the Board upon the grounds that their decisions are patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and further because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. 2)The two year contract had expired, the business had been sold and to elevate the issue to the point where a rehearing would seem counter productive. 3)The retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions and arguments and would seem to be contrary to curial deference and to reason.

d_2012skca52.txt,"The accused was convicted of four counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown had proceeded by indictment and the accused was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 8 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year Sexual Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) compliance order. At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3). Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who committed multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or altogether.","The Crown's appeal from the sentencing judge's order under s.490.012(1) of the Criminal Code, which directed the appellant to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) for 20 years, is allowed. The appellant was convicted on each of four charges of sexual assault. As the Crown proceeded by indictment, he was subject to imprisonment for term not exceeding ten years on each conviction. He was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 4 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a ten-year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20 year SOIRA compliance order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)If Parliament had intended the narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who commits multiple designated offences, regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or all together. 2)The Court unanimously found that Parliament erred in law in its interpretation of s490.013. The order must be set aside and replaced with a lifetime SOIra compliance order; 3)The Crown clearly intended to use s.485.013 to apply wider to the appellant. It clearly intended that s.491.013 would apply to him. 4)The appellant had been convicted of more than one 'designated offence'. Where an offender is convicted of a designated offence, the sentence is concomitantly pronounced for multiple “designated offences” and the offender’s criminal record discloses no prior convictions for a “Designated offence”. The duration of the sentence was determined by reference to s.476.013 of the Code. An order made under subsection 490.012 (1) ends 20 years after it was made if the maximum term of imprisonment for the offence is 10 or 14 years; and (2) Duration of the order applies for life if the offender who commit multiple designated offence will be subject to a lifetime S.485(2)(b). The meaning of the section is plain: the lifetime duration of an order rests on the offender being sentenced separately for each offence. Sexual assault is a 'designation offence' under s 490.011(a). Where a designated offense, s.502.012 requires the sentencing Judge to order the offender to comply."
8_2006skqb274.txt,"DIGEST The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000. HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit. 3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","The appellants were convicted by a provincial court judge of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act, S.C. 1990, c.21 (the 'Act'), and the health of animals Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the judge was a fine of $69,000, allocated amongst the fifteen counts. The appellants appealed the sentence on the basis that the fines were too harsh and the consecutive sentences exceeded the overall capability of the offender to pay. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s.734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed. 2)The sentence was clearly unfit and the fines must be sufficient to deter the offender from committing these offences. 3)The Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to continue this appeal. It was advised that Alsager had been previously convicted of transporting wildlife without prescribed documents and was fined $700.

b_2004skqb156.txt,"The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle. There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3) Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.

6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","This is a divorce proceeding between Jodie and Allan. The parties began cohabitating in 2001 and separated less than one year later. They have a child, Ella, born April 2004. The parenting and support issues concerning Ella have been resolved.

4_2010skqb193.txt,"The litigation revolved around a claim by the plaintiffs for damages that resulted from a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006. In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery. HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence. Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery. In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery. The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars.","FIAT: The plaintiffs were operating a tractor unit bearing Manitoba licence plates and pulling semi-trailer bearing an Alberta licence plate. The tractor was owned by an Alberta company and the plaintiffs, presumably husband and wife, were residents of the Province of Alberta. On the 22nd day of August 2004, the plaintiffs were involved in a head on collision on a stretch of highway in Saskatchewan. The plaintiffs sustained a right leg injury, lacerations, back injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. The defendant auto insurers of each of the three provinces are named defendants. Saskatchewan, at all material times, was governed by a no-fault insurance regime. The plaintiff's statement of claim accords with Rule 139 and goes, perhaps as far in particularity as the state of health of the plaintiff, who is still under treatment for her injuries and special damages for same as such are not now fully ascertainable. The defendants must know with more particularly, garnered from the passage of time and therapeutic treatment and healing of the plaintiffs and the extent of her injuries, whether there will be a chronic disability and whether she will be chronic disability. Rule 164 enables a party, after delivery of the initial pleadings of the opponent, to demand better particulars and disclosure of documents. This Rule contains at least two major purposes: first, to assess the merits of settlement discussions; and secondly, to properly prepare for discovery. In this particular case, both the first and second reasons just stated have merit. Rule 139 states that 'every pleading shall contain and contain only a statement in summary form of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim or defence, but not the evidence by which the facts are to be proved. pleading shall be as brief as the nature of the case will permit.' Rule 164 has a different, but similar, scope. Unlike Rule 139, which has as its main purpose the provision of sufficient particulars to enable a defendant to comprehend the nature and extent of a plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence, Rule 164 allows a party to demand a party's own medical examinations of this plaintiff by request to the plaintiff or court. HELD: 1) Rule 164 provides to the defendants right to deliver notice in writing to the plaintiffs requiring the plaintiffs to provide, 'a further and better statement of their claim... and, better particulars of any matter of which particulars should properly be given and such notices shall clearly state the particulars required. 2) The defendants are entitled to this information at a minimum before discovery."
5_2002skqb378.txt,"All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old.

The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.","The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that [J.C.M.] provide to the petitioners copies of his tax returns for 1999, 2000 and 2001 and his notices of assessment for 2001 and 2002. The parties have been unable to reach an agreement with respect to child support and accordingly have proceeded to trial. Retroactive child support should be fixed at $1,500.

The Court ordered that the petitioner pay 59% of the costs of [N.G.K.B.]s 2002 music program expense. 2)The Court ordered retroactive support of $293 per month. 3)The respondent's contribution to the petitioner's s. 7(f) expenses did not meet the requirements set out in the Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The child care expenses incurred in this case do not meet such a qualification. 4)A $20 expense for pre-school and kindergarten could not meet this qualification. 5)The child support awarded retroactive to August of 2000. 6)The court found that retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted."

The receiver manager of the registered owner (the numbered company) under the Bankruptcy Act and the instrument appointed receiver on behalf of the secured creditor and mortgagee (HSBC Bank) applied for a vesting order. The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year. HELD: The vesting order was granted. 1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so. In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87. 2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor. The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment.","FIAT. The applicant applied for a vesting order under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, 1985, c. B-3 and an instrument appointed receiver of the registered owner on behalf of the HSBC Bank, a secured creditor and mortgagee of certain real property of the Registered Owner applies for a conditional order with respect to a sale of the real property. The vesting orders applied for would register title in favour of the proposed purchaser of the property obtained as a result of a year long effort by the applicant trustee to sell it. No subsequent encumbrancers, competing creditors nor the Registered owner's rights respecting redemption or preservation of equity (there is none) were adversely affected if the order was granted. HELD: Application granted. 1) The jurisdiction formerly granted to the court by s. 87 of The Land Titles Act, s. 1978, cL-5 not brought forward in the new Land Title Act, 2000, S.S. 2000 combined with ss. 12 and 65 of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998, SS. 1998, and in particular Regulation 6.5 dealing with vesting power was reintroduced by the Land Titling Facilitation Regulations, R.R.S., c. L-5.1, Reg. 2, and Regulation 6(5). 2) The court raised with counsel for the applicant the court's jurisdiction to issue the vesting ordered applied for in these circumstances. Neither HSBC nor the trustee proceeded with foreclosure proceedings against the property in question. Counsel requested the opportunity to address the concerns raised and to make supplementary submission in support of its application. 3) The application for the vests order applied for is granted. The materials filed represent and satisfy the court that there are no other interests that will be adversely affected by the order granted. There are no subsequent encumsbrancers or competing creditors. No other interests respecting redemption, preservation of property or redemption of equity are adversely affected. 4) Under no circumstances should vesting an order be made unless or until the rights of all interested parties have either been relinquished or have been extinguished by due process. The application was granted and the form of the draft order filed with the applicant solicitor's subsequent submissions dated February 13, 2003 may issue."
2_1999canlii12455.txt,"The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support. Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The primary issue between the parties is custody of their four children. Ancillary to and dependent upon determination of the custody issue is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party. Matrimonial property owned by the parties at the time of separation has largely been divided between them to their mutual satisfaction, with the exception of few items to be dealt with by way of court order. The uncontradicted evidence indicated that the most important consideration for these children now is stability. That stability is found in their father's home. HELD: In making an order for custody pursuant to s. 8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act, I must take into consideration only the best interests of the children as determined by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of those children. The children have the most stability and where they receive the most structure and support in their educational endeavours."
c_2016skqb269.txt,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of the following: 1) The mass of material emphasized the dangers, and the importance of following the safety procedures, rather than burying them; 2) The accused failed to exercise due care and diligence to avoid the contravention of s. 124 of the Canada Labour Code; and 3) The Court did not accept the Crown's position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proves the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The court found that there were many photos, drawings and words in the material. The evidence did not establish that the information was not understandable, however, and it did not necessarily mean that the worker would not be able to learn and retain what he had learned."
c_2011nssc20.txt,"The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson. They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","The plaintiffs were injured in a single vehicle accident while passengers in a vehicle driven by the other plaintiff. Both Steven and Jody were paid damages for the injuries they sustained. The amount paid to each of the plaintiffs was acknowledged in writing and they each signed a release acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. HELD: The motion for summary judgment was granted and the claims of both the plaintiffs were dismissed. 1)There are no genuine issues of material fact requiring a trial. What facts are in dispute only pertain to the claim made by Maria Johansson and the GMCL has passed the initial hurdle leaving it to the other two plaintiffs to establish, on the facts that are not in dispute, that their claim has a real chance of success. 2)Both “Fraser River” conditions are satisfied and GMCL should be entitled to use the Releases to defend against the two plaintiffs who have already been compensated for their injuries by Citadel. To allow their action to proceed would be an abuse of this Court’s process."
1999skqb29.txt,"In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","FIAT. The applicants sought an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development, including the subject bylaw, and from further considering an application for a discretionary use permit by Kathy and Gary Palidwar for a private hotel development connected with the community facility known as the Evergreen Centre. HELD: The application was granted in part. 1)The respondent had not met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. 2)The applicant's proceedings were not in the public interest and further, that the council acted unreasonably and arbitrarily and without the degree of fairness, openness, and impartiality required of municipal government. 3)The applicants were hoteliers who operate five of the six hotels and motels within the community and who have joined together in an informal association. The proposal was not disclosed for two weeks. During that time no action was taken by the Council, although the members may have given thought to the proposal, something which they were entitled to do.  4)Two of the other shareholders were mayor of the Town and an alderman on Council. 5)The proposed hotel would be connected to the community's recreation and sports centre. The applicant's proposal appeared to elicit some support, but the council took certain steps to bring the proposal to fruition. When the proposal came up for discussion, the applicants were invited to stay for the rest of the meeting."
2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","The appellant sought a declaration to strike the appellant's claim under s. 36 of the Constitution Act, 1982, alleging that the Government of Nova Scotia had breached its commitment to the appellant. The appellant brought an application under Nova Scotia Civil Procedure Rule (1972) 14.25, which struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. HELD: Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. 1)The Court found that the appellant had not breached its constitutional obligation to the respondent. 2)The appellant's pleading did not raise a reasonable cause for action. The Court held that, in the context of this appeal, the Court must stick to the 'plain and obvious' test set out in Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., [1972] 13.03. 3)The issue for the appellant was whether the respondent's proposed interpretation of s.36 represented an actionable commitment for the benefit of the appellant and whether the Chambers judge committed an appealable error. 4)The respondent's application was brought under the Nova Scotia civil procedure rule (1972), which held that the province receives equalization funds from Ottawa for this very purpose. 5)The court found that, without a challenge to legislation, the appellant’s statement of claim could only succeed in the clearest of cases, where it was plain and obvious or beyond reasonable doubt that there was no reasonable basis for it to be struck. The court concluded that the respondent had not committed an error. 6)The appeal was dismissed."
6_2001nssc105.txt,"The plaintiff and defendant entered into an oral contract for the development and sale of land. The plaintiff brought an action to recover its commission on the contract. Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done. Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable. An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties.","This was an action by the plaintiffs for damages for breach of contract or in the alternative claim for unjust enrichment and/or quantum meruit. HELD: 1) There was an oral agreement for payment of a fixed commission between the parties. There were definite terms and an award of unjust enrichment was made to compensate for work done. There was no evidence that the oral agreement was enforceable. In the absence of an enforceable agreement, the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the Defendants based upon quantum meruits or unjust enrichment. 2) There is no evidence to support the plaintiff's claim that there was any discussion of the commission structure. 3) The plaintiff carries on business as a licensed real estate broker with an office in Lunenburg. He is retired heart surgeon and resides with his wife at Halifax. 4) The plaintiffs have a number of properties on the property which are essentially ready to market. The plaintiff commenced his real estate business as seasonal resident in 1973. He acquired many parcels of land in an area known as Hell Point or Hell Point. The transactions were negotiated privately between the plaintiff and various owners of the lots. The parties had substantial number of sheep on the land and had a serious problem with coyotes. It was at this meeting that the plaintiff decided to terminate his contract with the plaintiff. The court was left with questions as to the nature of the contract and the extent to which the agreement could be broken down. 5) The Court was left to determine the appropriate amount of costs. 6) The court found that the defendant's commission was 10% inclusive of the project management. The commission structure was negotiable. The Court found that if the defendant ever got involved in a sub-division, his fee would be 10% of the total sales when the sales took place. 7) The defendant was entitled to a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the properties. 8) Although the plaintiff had not made a final decision on the marketing of the property, the Court found the defendant to be entitled to some form of compensation for the work he had done in the past. 9) It is important to note that the Court was not satisfied with the terms of the agreement. 10) The Commission is not enforceable and the Court is left with the discretion of the parties to decide how the Commission should be structured. The Commission structure is negotable. If the Court finds that the Commission is enforceable the Court will withdraw the project."
e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court granted the respondent interim primary residence and an equal division of family home and property. The Court found the petitioner's Federal Child Support Guidelines income to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal support of $5,250.00 per month."

HELD: 1) There may be merit to the defendant's claim, but it cannot be dealt with in this application. While several affidavits were filed, none of them speak to the circumstances wherein the impugned remarks were made.

The statement of claim speaks of the remarks being made to board members. However, that phrase may only be descriptive of the persons. It does not establish that the persons were carrying out some board function at the relevant time. 3) The statements of claim alleges malice. The affidavits filed do not say anything about the circumstances of the statements made or the dates on which the statements were made thus depriving the plaintiff of the ability to address the applicable limitation period. 4) There is no evidence that the words spoken or written were published on a lawful occasion, that is one 'fairly warranted by some reasonable occasion or exigency'. The defendant failed to plead any facts as to the date on which these statements were supposed to have been made, and deprives the Plaintiff of the opportunity to address that limitation period in any event. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to sue the defendant for defamation for breach of contract and breach of her employment agreement. 6) The defendant can claim qualified privilege under the Law of Defamation In Canada. While a number of affidavits ( affidavits) were filed in support of the application, no evidence was made available to the court as to when, and locations where, such statements were supposedly made. The defendant must establish a fairly warranted basis or a'reciprocity of interest or duty' for the statements to be made. Reciprocal of interest is essential.

7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the defendant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the defendant held a security interest. The defendant denies permission to remove the building unless the credit union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Gari’s claims in this regard must fail. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)It is common ground that the defendant was seeking security for possible damage caused by removal of the building but was not seeking rent and reimbursement for taxes paid. 2)It would have been improper for Gari to deny permission to leave the Building unless the Credit union paid its amount. 3)The Court reviewed the relevant provisions of the PPSA and concluded that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between the defendant and the land owner.

During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence. HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case. The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects.",The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of impaired driving on the basis that two breath samples taken after the arrest of him were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The Crown did not set forth any grounds for setting aside the conviction on the impaired driving charge and the issue was not pursued at the hearing of this appeal. The trial judge relied on irrelevant evidence and failed to consider other more relevant evidence. The Court found that the learned trial judge erred in law in excluding two breath sample samples taken post-accident. The accused was found to have consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his speech was slurred at times; he had an odour of alcohol on his breath; and he was confused as indicated by his inability to orient himself.
d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","The accused was found guilty of conspiring with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 465(1) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46, and trafficking in steroids only. He was sentenced to 7.5 years in custody and prohibited from applying for parole before the expiry of three years. During the course of the trial, Crown counsel disclosed the existence of approximately 1,900 documents. The accused applied to adjourn the trial to allow the trial judge to review them. The trial judge granted the adjournment and ordered a new trial. The Court reviewed the documents and found that there were 27 additional documents not previously disclosed in the combined forces database that could have affected the accused’s right to make a full answer and defence. HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of breach of s. 11(d) and found new trial warranted. There was no direct evidence linking the accused to trafficking in cocaine, including the information pertaining to two upcoming witnesses."
d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.","At the time of the motor vehicle accident, the plaintiffs were living in common law relationship and they had spent the evening visiting various bars and pubs in celebration of birthdays of relatives. The defendant motor vehicle was involved in an accident which involved a Royal Canadian Mounted Police vehicle. The plaintiffs claimed the accident occurred as a result of the negligence of the defendant in the operation of the police vehicle referred to herein as the 'police vehicle'. HELD: The plaintiffs claim the defendant was not qualified to express an opinion and that the plaintiff is contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. The plaintiff was driving directly through the intersection on a green light. Up to that point the headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle and they were not in operation when it was struck.  1) When the plaintiffs moved for the destruction of the exhibits, the defendant argued that the exhibits were not properly destroyed. 2) The evidence was not presented to establish that the officer was capable of expressing an opinion. The Court found that up to that time the plaintiff was not aware of the intersection and that she was blinded by the lights of the vehicle as she left the parking lot. 3) There was no evidence of the officer's wearing of a seat belt. The evidence from the officer convinced the Court that he was in the field in which it is sought to have the witness’ opinion. 4) The Court was not satisfied that the evidence was admissible."
2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","HELD: There was a judgment in favour of the petitioner for $1,945. The petitioner had some assets which could be shared but her share would only be $2,000.00 or so as he was quick to claim exemption for his own house, which they never lived in, and all of the assets which he had before the marriage. Five of the children lived with the petitioner in the home. The court applied a 30% deduction to their value leaving $6,690. The Court noted that the children were employed by the public school system and had a permanent job. He had the prospect of an inheritance from his mother, a good pension, his own home with no mortgage and in short no financial problems. He was even better off if he were to award the $25,000 against the matrimonial home."
b_1990canlii4176.txt,"This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff had worked for 28 years for the defendant as a driver making deliveries to customers. The defendant dismissed the plaintiff for 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The plaintiff had taken longer coffee and lunch breaks than were allowed, and had taken unauthorized breaks for which he had then been paid overtime by the defendant. For the defendant, that the dismissal was justified. The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules.","The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as a driver and driver's helper. He was dismissed from his employment without notice. The plaintiff contended that his hours of work were 7:15 a.m. to 3:45 p.m., that he was under surveillance and that he took longer than authorized breaks, consumed alcohol during the work day and submitted claims for overtime which were unjustified and basically dishonest. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant was justified in dismissing the plaintiff for his failure to abide by the company's overtime policy. 2)The court found that the defendant had satisfied the onus on the defendant to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that there was just cause for the dismissal of the plaintiff."
5_2011nssc53.txt,"A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","The father sought party and party costs against his son. The central issue in the father's application was not about the meaning of his mother's will but about the failure of the representatives of the Hand's estate to provide an accounting. The father sought to have his solicitor and client costs paid out of the estate. Alternatively, he sought party costs. Allowing the application and ordering costs in favour of the father, those three parties will bear their own costs. In light of the present position of Dr. Hand and his daughter, and my determination not to order costs in favor of Mr. Hand, the courts have ordered the parties' costs to be paid out."
b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","The plaintiff claims his personal and professional reputation has been seriously damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. HELD: The plaintiff has proven that he was defamed. However, the defendants' defence of qualified privilege is accepted. 1) The plaintiff was the director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) and was an active participant in the harassment himself. 2) The court found that the plaintiff had not been defamed but was guilty of malicious pre-judgmental action. 3) The Court accepted the defendants’ defence that the words in the grievance referred to the plaintiff and not to him. The Court found that there was no basis for jurisdictional defence."
8_1998canlii13830.txt,"An appeal of conviction on a charge of dangerous driving on the grounds the trial judge erred in holding that statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in the criminal proceedings; and in holding the statements could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police and therefore were voluntary and admissible. The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal. Objections to the admissiblilty of the accused's statements based upon the Charter raise a different issue and considerations from the application of common law principles and a different conclusion may have been reached.","The appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. 1)Had the Charter issues been raised and argued before the learned trial judge, a conclusion different from the one reached (based solely upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness) may well have resulted. 2)Had there been a determination that the statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in criminal proceedings against him, neither the conviction nor the conviction could have resulted in a conviction.

9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.",The accused was 19 years old at the time of the accident and lived in the city. He was charged with dangerous driving causing death. The Crown argued that a sentence in the lower end of the range is one which should be imposed and that such a sentence should be a conditional sentence to be served in the community rather than in a corrections facility. HELD: The accused was sentenced to 90 days in the Provincial Correctional Centre. 1)The accused had consumed significant quantity of alcohol and was in no shape to drive vehicle. His actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his failure to pay attention to the situation resulted in the death of his passenger. 2)The Court of Appeal rejected alternatives to incarceration as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from commencing dangerous driving offences. 3)The Crown sought a period of imprisonment for 90 days and an 18 month sentence for 18 months. 4)A troubling factor in this instance arises from the fact that the accused was convicted for two speeding offences. The accused had been drinking and fell asleep at the wheel. The accident occurred when he was attempting to pass vehicles on the right shoulder of a main highway at peak traffic speeds at high speeds. The pedestrian was thrown from the vehicle and was hospitalized for 24 hours.
9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The defendants applied for an order severing the plaintiffs' claim between liability and damages. The plaintiffs alleged that Wolff, along with Sparks, set up a competing business through their corporation to compete against the plaintiffs in the business of SR&ED consulting. The defendants alleged Wolff was bound by a confidentiality and non-competition agreement with the defendants and had breached that agreement and his contract of employment. The documents seized under the Anton Piller order had provided full disclosure to the plaintiffs of the defendants' work product. They sought injunctions against the defendants, return of property taken, and damages for breach of contract and disgorgement of all profits gained through the breaches of fiduciary obligations. HELD: The application to strike portions of the claim was dismissed. 1)The plaintiffs' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the plaintiffs’ obligation to maintain their position.  2)The court reviewed the Queen’s Bench Rules and found that the issues of liability and the issue of damages were properly pled. 3)The defendants’ application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only had merit. The joint venture required confidentiality and disclosure. The disclosure of these documents would seriously prejudice the plaintiffs. 4)The Court reviewed the factors summarized in Chaban, supra. The Court found that there was a clear severability between the threshold of liability between the liability and consequential issue and that the plaintiffs had no assurance that the defendants were not pursuing their clients. 5)Costs were to be determined by the court. 6)Although the court has the inherent jurisdiction to order severance of the claims in the first instance, the Court has the discretion only if there is severe prejudice to the moving party as opposed to ordinary prejudice."
d_2016skpc19.txt,"HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.","HELD: The Court found that the accused had in his possession child pornography. The accused was a member of the Internet Child Exploitation Unit (ICE) Unit. The ICE unit was involved in the investigation of the accused. The search warrant authorized the search of a duplex located within the RCMP campground. During the course of the investigation, the accused was summoned to the detachment by the ICE unit and arrested. The first two files being flagged by the RCMP were all from the same client and the same physical address. The second file was from a different client and was found later. The third file was a laptop computer with the operating system encrypted so that it could not be accessed without password. The fourth file was found to be from a third client. The Court was not satisfied with the conclusion that the third party, who was a user of the third client, had downloaded the third file and was using it to access a third party's third party file. The court found that both the third and fourth hard drives were completely encrypted and were not accessible to police. Therefore, the Court found the accused guilty of accessing third party files."
7_2013skqb67.txt,"The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","The petitioner attended a settlement meeting and reached an agreement on seven issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit of October 16, 2012. The petitioner did not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and suggested it should terminate June 27, 2013. HELD: 1) The respondent was to pay child support of $1,213 per month commencing September 1, 2012 and payable on the first of each month thereafter. The court reviewed the contents of the document and indicated it would not be appropriate to set monthly payment on account of any arrears which might exist as of the date of this order and indicated would not do so until ruled on its admissibility. 2) The parties have three children. They now have a shared parenting arrangement. 3) The petitioner cohabitates with a woman who is employed full-time but assume for present purposes that she is not at this time a common law partner for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. (5th Supp.) as they have not cohabitated in the conjugal relationship for twelve consecutive months. 4) The Court reviewed the policy considerations which underly settlement privilege and as identified in Tucker-Lester require that unless all of the issues have been resolved, privilege continues to extend to those issues where there may have been a consensus unless there is a clear understanding and agreement that once one of these issues is resolved it is off the table and considered to be settled irrespective of what may happen with respect to other issues that may exist as between the parties. 5) The court struck the last three sentences of para. 4 and Exhibit A of Exhibit A. The Court noted that in the circumstances at hand, so long as the respondent continued to receive the full child tax benefit, the SSAG calculation would range from low of $36 per month to high of $527.00 per month. While that may be the present scenario, it may change. Other factors in the future can change the economic consequences of the tax system and it could have bearing on the ability to claim the AED tax credit. In the event they cannot agree, an application may be made in chambers."
a_1995canlii4000.txt,"The Appellant/Defendant, Bennett appealed a judgment resulting from a jury trial. At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings. The Respondent/Plaintiff cross-appealed on the issue of whether the trial judge should have directed the jury to deduct sick leave benefits from her past loss of income. Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","Following a jury trial of this action for damages for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile collision, a judgment was pronounced awarding damages of $409,251.18 to the respondent. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in law in failing to caution the jury regarding the weight to be given evidence of Douglas Kalesnikoff. HELD: The appellant's first ground of appeal was dismissed. 1)Although the appellant made the calculations in P-16, we cannot characterize his testimony as 'expert opinion' evidence in this case. Since liability was admitted by the defendant the trial was limited to assessment of damages by the jury. Accordingly, the tabulation could have been made in much the same way as in Seip, supra. 2)The appellant limits her challenge to the 'future loss of earnings' component in the amount of $337,130.00. 3)There is no clear medical evidence that the appellant has diminished ability to earn income in the future, as the need of the jury for assistance in that area has not been demonstrated. 4)Computer programs for calculating future loss of future earnings are available. 5)The Court rejected the appellant's application to deduct sick leave benefits which were used in consequence of her injuries from the past loss of income."

Dismissing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that if the appellant's sister and girlfriend was accepted, then the inducement offered by the Crown was clearly established, and the Crown would not have failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that his statements were voluntary."
e_2001nssc162.txt,"The defendant made an addition to single family residence. Following a dispute between the parties as to whether the defendant's use of the property now complied with the plaintiff's land-use bylaw for a single family residence, a consent order was issued dealing with the structure of the property and how it would be used. The plaintiff sought a finding that the defendant was in contempt of the consent order, seeking enforcement of the provisions of the consent order and an order that the defendant pay a fine. Defendant found in contempt of consent order; fine ordered in the amount of $10,000; if defendant has not complied with the terms of the consent order by January 31, 2002, the Sheriff is ordered to enter the property and receive the rents, profits and income thereof until the defendant clears his contempt; the door and hardware between the original structure and the addition is be removed; any references to separate apartments are to be removed from the property; the second power meter is to be removed from the property and the second cable television connection and associated billing provisions are to be eliminated; the defendant is to provide within 15 days the names of all tenants and if and when there are changes in any of the tenants, he must provide the plaintiff with the particulars of the new and remaining tenants; all tenants must be notified in writing prior to entry of occupation that the entire structure and building is only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit; copies of any written leases are to be provided to the plaintiff within 15 days of their execution; the plaintiff can enter the premises for the purposes of random inspection on a bi-monthly basis until the plaintiff is satisfied that this Order has been complied with and thereafter, the plaintiff is entitled to inspect the premises at random once a month while the defendant remains the owner of the property; the fine will not be crystallized into a judgment and execution if the defendant complies fully with all the requirements of this order on or before January 1, 2002. The plaintiff is entitled to solicitor-client costs.",HELD: The court found that the respondent was in contempt of court for failing to comply with a Consent Order issued in January 2001. The respondent was ordered to provide a copy of the lease within fifteen days of the order being made and to advise any and all tenants in writing that the entire structure and building was only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit. The second power meter must be removed from the premises and the second cable television connection and associated billing provisions were to be eliminated. The fine was not crystalized into a Judgment and Execution but rather a fine was payable forthwith.
2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to clause 15.10 of the lease quashed. The lease contained an arbitration clause. The tenant argued that the arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and that all disputes between the parties were to be settled by arbitration, but only disputes involving the clauses of a lease. The arbitrator was not correct in concluding that he had authority to award damages. He was incorrect in assuming jurisdiction to apply the principle of estoppel against the Tenants. HELD: The award of $318,252.00 for repairs and $59,130.34 for loss of rental opportunity was not subject to judicial review. The arbitration clause under the lease is a limited one. That is beyond the scope of the Arbitration clause because it is not a dispute about the clauses or provisions of the contract. There is no jurisdiction to resolve a claim such as this which arises from the Landlord/Tenant relationship itself and not the clauses and provisions of this lease.  1)The arbitrator is not limited to interpreting the words in the lease but could deal with the issues of insurance coverage and whether insurance should cover the damage. 2)The court concluded that the standard of review is correctness with respect to the interpretation of the clause. It was not patently unreasonable. 3)It was not necessary for the court to consider parol evidence. 4)The Court concluded that it was appropriate to intervene if there was a genuine excess of jurisdiction."
c_1999canlii12484.txt,"In issue was whether the law firm was in a conflict of interest with respect to two matrimonial files and whether the firm could remain as counsel for the spouses. HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux. The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm. At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes. She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses. 2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case. There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening. Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her. The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet. The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter. The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.","This was an application for a determination as to whether the law firm of Olive, Waller, Zinkhan & Waller was in a position of conflict of interest with respect to the matrimonial files of Magnes v. Magnes and D.A.L. and whether the firm may remain as counsel for the plaintiffs in those proceedings. HELD: The screen was sufficient in the circumstances of this case. There was no risk of real mischief. The law firm had put in place many of the screening measures suggested by the Guidelines in the Code. While there was a general presumption that such confidential information passes between lawyer and client by virtue of the solicitor and client relationship, there must be independently verifiable procedures which have been taken to ensure there is no disclosure to any member of the former client's confidential information. The screening measures were done so quickly that they may have not actually occurred by the time Ms. Fitzsimmons commenced employment. There is no real risk to the plaintiffs."
e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to ss. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with operating while his blood alcohol content exceeded.08 contrary to s. 253(2) and with driving while impaired by.08 with a blood alcohol concentration in excess.08. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: 1) There was no breach of s. 8 or s. 9 of the Charter and the Certificate of Analysis was therefore admissible. 2) The driving irregularities and the physical symptoms of the accused painted a virtual stereotypic portrait of a motorist impaired by impairment. The absence of the smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption of beverage alcohol did not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia considered in their totality. 3) The Court found that the accused's belief was honestly held and subjectively valid. The Court concluded that the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 4) It is the view of the Court that there was no evidence that the officer reasonably could have only a mere suspicion the accused had alcohol in his body. 5) In the face of the manner of driving demonstrated by the accused and the very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest the officer could have had only a simple suspicion. 6) There is no evidence to suggest there was any impairment of the ability to drive by alcohol. The officer did list a number of indicia which person reasonably could conclude were the result of the ingestion of alcohol. If there were insufficient grounds, the certificate of analysis should not be excluded given the reasoning of R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32 (CanLII), [2011 SCC32), [2012 SKQB 451) and [2011 SKQB 554)]. The Court held that it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious cause was impairment by alcohol but there may be instances where the evidence in question is reliable and was obtained in a non-invasive manner. 7) In this case, there is no dispute that the police officer was entitled to draw inferences and conclusions based on experience. The only question is whether, in the absence of any smell of or admission of alcohol, his belief can be verified objectively."
4_1998canlii13643.txt,"The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the decision of an adjudicator made following a hearing pursuant to s. 62.1 and 62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts, as he found that Cajon, as the appellant's employer, had an obligation to attempt to resolve a matter of work difficulties that had prevented her from reporting to work. 2)Cajon acted well within its jurisdiction when determining what the terms of Ms. Kovach's employment contract were and that the employer had not failed to fulfill its obligations thereunder. The adjudicator did not examine his company's lease (which was not produced at the hearing) in order to determine whether the adjudicator erred in law by ruling that the employment contract was not frustrated by the appellant. The appeal based on the submission that the appellant had not frustrated or fundamentally broken her employment contract did not succeed. 3)There was insufficient evidence to show that the respondent was incapable of performing its employment contract obligations.  4)It was not patently unreasonable to conclude that an employer acted reasonably in determining what terms of a saloon employee’s employment contract (i.e. permitting her to return to work) were not in breach of the contract. 5)Although not all of the facts presented to the Court were known to this Court, his decision outlines some evidence upon which he could have arrived at his conclusions. The doctrine of frustration cannot be applied to this case."
6_2002nsca46.txt,"The plaintiff appealed an interlocutory decision in which the chambers judge held that a non-party medical doctor who had provided emergency treatment to the plaintiff did not have to answer certain interrogatories on the basis that they required an opinion. The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial. Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given. Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided. However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided. Interrogatories cannot be used to usurp the Rules surrounding the use of expert evidence.","The appellant applied for leave to appeal and, if granted, to appeal the interlocutory order refusing to appoint Dr. Miller a court expert and refusing to order him to answer certain interrogatories, the majority of which call for his opinion concerning the medical services provided by the respondent, another physician, to the appellant. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed in part as well as the appeal for costs. 1)The detail required by this Rule ensures the factual basis of the expert's opinion is clear to the trier of fact who will have to assess the weight to give the opinion taking into account and ensures adequate notice to the parties of experts opinions to avoid surprise and help them discover the truth. This rule also provides specifically for discoveries of experts and their reimbursement. 2)To allow interrogatories to usurp this function, without the presence of such safeguards for the parties, the experts and the court, would not be in accordance with the orderly and fair trial practice and procedure that the Civil Procedure Rules promote.  3)The issue of opinion is whether the opinions sought by the interrogatories in this case are opinions which CPR 19 requires be provided. The chambers judge considered these interrogatories and determined they were not relevant. He did not err in his determination. The appellant is entitled to have these answered, even if this requires the doctor to disclose the opinions that went into the formation of his judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant during this period of time.  4)The chambers judge erred by overstating the basis upon which a non-party witness may object to answer an interrogatory calling for an opinion, when he stated that the doctor cannot be compelled to provide opinion evidence simply because he was a subsequently treating physician to Mr. Madore even though he may possess an expertise in the area of treatment."
2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The appellants appealed their summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal right to hunt for food and, as already indicated, laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. 2)The legislation in issue did not affect the appellants' aboriginal right of hunt. 3)It was not necessary to apply the test established by Sparrow and expanded in the subsequent authorities. The trial judge did not go on to consider infringement and justification pursuant to Sparrow. 4)The issue on this appeal was whether the appellant appellants were Indians within the meaning of s. 91(24) of The Constitution Act, 1867. The objective was primarally safety, both from the words used in the legislation and the evidence introduced. The word 'Indian' as contained in s. 12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement (NRTA) never was part of any aboriginal hunting right and even if there was an infringement of aboriginal rights, it was justified pursuant to the Sparrow test. 5)The court reviewed the relevant authorities when considering interjurisdictional immunity. It found that the Saskatchewan regulations were not unreasonable safety legislation and that they did not touch the core of Indianness. The appellants had succeeded in challenging the limitation of night hunting with artificial lights. 6)The test for prima facie infringement was not tested in Sparrow. The court found that it was an error in law to consider safety as a factor in determining whether the legislation infringed aboriginal rights and, if so, whether it was justifiable. 7)The appeal was set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. If so, it must meet the Sparrow justification test. 8)The objective of the legislation is primarality safety. If Metis people are Indians, they enjoy an aboriginal right that is protected by s. 35(1)of the Constitution Act. The Aboriginal group has been consulted. 9)The question of whether the appellant are Indians (Metis) is a valid issue. 10)The evidence supports the conclusion that the legislation has not infringed their aboriginal right. 11)"

2_2008nssm4.txt,"The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined. The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","This is an appeal from an order of the Director dated December 13, 2007. That order allowed the Tenant the sum of $787.50 against the Landlord as compensation arising from what the Director found to be a breach of the statutory condition to provide a premises suitable for habitation. The Landlord did not attend the hearing before the Director. It appears that she missed it inadvertently. The Tenant appeals to this Court against the findings. HELD: 1) The Court found that the Director was essentially correct and her discounting of the value of the rug and clothing went a little too far, in my opinion.  2) The damages were a little higher. The Court assessed the damages at $862.50. It would allow $712.50 for the furniture, $50.00 for the area rug and $100 for the clothing for a total of $863.50, but would not allow the damages for furniture and $75 for clothing. The damages are assessed on a de novo basis. The Director discounted the property damage claims on the basis that the furniture's value should be discounted, and because of the lack of evidence of the other items. She allowed the furniture and clothing to be valued at $75 and $80 for the rug."
9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.",The deceased's widow received a death benefit for herself and two children. She took issue with the calculation of the death benefit as provided by the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. She appealed the decision to the Court of Queen's Bench. HELD: 1)The death benefit is 50% of the deceased's actual gross yearly employment income. The 'income replacement benefit' referred to in Division 5 of the Act is a different statutory creature than the income replacement benefit in Division 4. The ordinary meaning of this is that the payment is made to the surviving spouse on a weekly basis. 2)The IRB as calculated in s. 146(1) is the same as the IRB for her as a surviving spouse and for her two dependent children in accordance with the directions of this court.

It was not known at the time that the plaintiff made arrangements to hire an experienced subcontractor. The consultant hired to advise the defendant on the technical aspects of the project used reliable independent sources for his information about the operational viability of the planes. He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.  3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","The Government of Saskatchewan tendered a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. Four companies submitted tenders in response to the defendant's invitation to tender. The plaintiff, West Central Air Ltd., submitted the lowest tender. HELD: The contract was awarded to Nielsen Ashdown. An implied term of the contract was that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenderers fairly and not give any of them an unfair advantage over the others. 1)An implied term such as fairness and the privilege clause are compatible and can co-exist together. While costs usually follow the result, this was an appropriate case in which to exercise my discretion to disallow costs to the successful party. 2)The tender package contained the usual privilege clause: The lowest, or any tender need not be accepted by the defendant; which clause has the effect of relieving the defendant from accepting the lowest bid for the project; but such a clause does not entitle the defendant to disregard its obligation to treat the plaintiff fairly. 3)The defendant conducted its investigation in a fair and impartial manner and in accordance with common industry practice."
d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","HELD: The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. Although the mother was the father of the children, the father was not. Both children were the subject of a consent order for six months on October 2, 2007 and were in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requested a 6 month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother supported the position of the father who asked that the children be returned to him in his care. The father proposed that he will continue living with the mother and the children while the mother first attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he proposes to address his own addiction problems. HELD: 1) The mother was not seeking a return to the children to her directly but supports the position that the father is seeking to have the children returned in his custody.  2) The father was seeking to continue living in the mother's residence and take anger management and parenting classes. His youth offences were primarily property crimes, motor vehicle offences, and failures to comply with recognizance and probation orders. His previous convictions were for failing to provide a sample of the sample for a substance abuse treatment program. He was apprehended at birth as was H.H. and D.S. Both of whom were in the care of the Ministry for the past 6 months. Both were in need of long-term placement plans. 3) The Ministry was requesting a six-month order with the proviso the Ministry be allowed to make a long term placement plan for both the children.  4) H. H. was the mother of two children, N.O.S., who was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both had been in care since the time they were first brought into the Ministry. The son was born in 2005 and is nearly four years old. The wife was apprehended in 2006 and is now residing in the Ministry's care and will soon be two years old; the father has a substantial criminal record which was tendered as Exhibit P-3 by the Minister. The Minister filed a book of documents marked Exhibit P1 with each document tabbed therein. References to tabs refer to this exhibit."
6_2014skpc40.txt,"Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","The accused is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance. The Crown now applies for third recognizances. HELD: 1) The accused is now assessed as a high risk to re-offend sexually and required to complete high intensity sex offender programming. He has never availed himself of such programming either during the almost 4 years he served in prison, nor afterwards in the almost four years since his release from prison. This takes the appropriate threshold notch above simple demonstration that defendant is more likely than not to commit an offence. While both impose restrictions upon an individual’s freedoms, such restrictions are only those as are necessary to assist the individual from committing future offences or misconduct. The fear to be established is that the defendant will commit a personal injury offence. The accused has demonstrated a history of abuse, neglect and violence against women and youth. He is also at high risk for re-occurrence of sexual assault. 2) There is a subjective and objective component to his belief that R.N.S. will commit either serious personal injury or sexual assault involving someone under the age of 16 years. There is both subjective and an objective component that must be established by the Crown (i.e. that an objective person armed with the same knowledge as the defendant would agree that his fears are reasonable). There is an objective element to his beliefs that he will commit such a serious offence. 3) The evidence that he only met with Ms. Woytiuk less than four times indicates that he was always resistant to taking the programming. The Court found that the accused had demonstrated a reasonably grounded fear of serious and imminent danger and that he remains high at risk to repeat the offences he committed. 4) There are common underlying principles applicable to both of these issues. The first is that there is no triggering event that can be taken very seriously. The second is that, based upon his history in the federal prison system, there is a component of imminency. It is not enough to address the underlying risk factors of substance abuse, domestic violence and sexual assault in the context of his unique circumstances."

HELD: The appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed. The judge made no error in ruling that all of the evidence from the prospective witnesses and transcripts was irrelevant as being unrelated to the charges and too remote in time. The appellant's state of mind was adequately established by his own evidence and the summation to the jury. The defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it. The sentence appeal was moot since it was limited to time served while awaiting trial.

9_1996canlii6809.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff brought an action against five defendants claiming fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a skin rash were the result of silicone implants. One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning. Ten years later she received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. The plaintiff now suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a persistent immune mediated skin rash on her chest. HELD: 1)The statement of claim does not disclose wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant, the Dow Chemical Company, although there is a causal connection between that conduct and the alleged damages suffered by the plaintiff. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages both in contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(1)(f) and following what was stated in the Moran case, this Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary, although any uncertainty or doubt is to be resolved in favour of the Defendant. 3)The plaintiffs plea that the corporate entity, DowCorning Corporation, was created for a specific task by the defendant and that in the carrying-out of that task they were in reality one and the same entity.  4)The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. The defendant is a publicly held corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware having its principal offices at the Dow Centre in Midland, Michigan. The statements of claim do not disclose an actionable wrong. However, they are alleged to be directly attributable to the defendant. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to a third party, but it attaches because of the relationship such as an employee-employee, or principal agent. If fault is found to be directly attributable to The Dow Chemical, then there is causal connection. The second situation is that the defendant breached its duty to disclose the risk inherent to the breast implants. This is largely repetition of what is stated earlier in the Statement of Claim, but also there is an allegation which suggests link between the alleged failure to disclose and the plaintiff's injuries. The Court must then move on to determine whether there is statutory jurisdiction."

The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term.

In the course of checking licences, registration, insurance policy and mechanical condition police are justified in making observations to detect drinking drivers; the right to counsel under s. 10(b) is suspended during this period.","The accused was convicted of driving with an illegal blood alcohol level after being pulled over by a police officer. His summary conviction appeal was allowed on the basis that he had been arbitrarily detained contrary to s. 9 of the Charter and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) was infringed. The Crown appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that although the stop was an arbitrary detention and the exclusion of evidence of the breathalyzer result, that was merely one of the options resulting from the same legislation and subject to the same rationale that were relevant in Bernshaw. The Court held that s. 189a(1) of the Highway Traffic Act on the right not to be arbitrarily detained is a reasonable one that is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. It is also clear from the decided cases that when the execution of these general duties involves interference with a person's liberty or property, the powers of the police officer are not unlimited."
b_2013skqb151.txt,"The applicant, the Government of Saskatchewan Victim Services Branch requested an order permitting a live audio broadcast of the trial of the accused from a courtroom in Saskatoon to a courtroom in Toronto for the exclusive benefit of the family of the deceased victim. The accused took no position. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. Making an order for video-conferencing for non- participating persons was not permitted because the Court had no control over the policing of the courtroom in Ontario. It would set a dangerous precedent that could result in multiple applications being made in future trials by numerous interested parties in different jurisdictions over which the Court had no control.","The applicant Government of Saskatchewan, Victim Services Branch, brought a motion before myself as trial judge for an order permitting a live audio/video broadcast of the trial set to proceed from a Court of Queen's Bench courtroom in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, to a courtroom in a court house in the Greater Toronto area, Ontario, for the exclusive benefit of the family of the deceased. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)Although this Court certainly has inherent jurisdiction to govern its own process within its own court within Saskatchewan, this Court has no jurisdiction to make any orders involving facilities and personnel in the Province of Ontario. It is being suggested that only approximately 12 family members would be allowed in the courtroom in Ontario and that the Ontario Victim Services personnel would be policing those requirements. 2)Although that trial originally was set for a three week jury trial, in all likelihood the trial will not take that long as Mr. Ottertail re-elected to be tried by Queen’s Bench judge alone on April 18, 2013. 3)While the Court has great sympathy for the family and understanding of their plight in not being able to observe the trial for personal reasons, it has concluded that it must dismiss this application due to the serious concerns it has in granting the order being requested."

The accused had previously applied to a Provincial Court judge, who had declined the accused's application. The issue was whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused's application for judicial interim release. HELD: The jurisdiction for determination of interim judicial release of a young person charged with murder under the Youth Criminal Justice Act rests solely with the superior court of criminal jurisdiction, which is the Court of Queen's Bench in Saskatchewan.","The accused was charged with second degree murder. The hearing on his interim judicial release was held before the Provincial Court judge. The Provincial Court declined the accused's application for judicial interim release on the grounds that his presence in the community awaiting trial would erode the public's confidence in the administration of justice. The Crown applied for a determination of two preliminary issues: 1)Whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused’s application for interim custody; and b)Whether this honourable court has jurisdiction to conduct review of the Youth Criminal Justice Act decision. The issue then becomes for young person charged with an offence set out in s. 522 of the Criminal Code. The jurisdiction for determination of interim custody on an offence of this nature is limited exclusively to the superior court unless another act of the parliament of Canada was to limit that jurisdiction. 2)Whether a youth court judge in a Provincial Court or Youth Court Judge in a Youth Court has jurisdiction in the province in which the accused is charged with the charge of murder. HELD: The matter of jurisdiction under the old Young Offender's Act rests solely with the provincial court in the Province of Saskatchewan is the Court of Queen's Bench. 3)Whether any other court, judge or justice, may release the young person from custody under that section. 4)Whether an Honourable Court could conduct a review of this decision. 5)The issue then arises whether the youth justice court judge under s. 13(2) was not a Youth Justice Court judge for an offence as set out by s.469 of the Code.  5) The Crown has asked for the determination of a preliminary issue: whether the Youth court judge had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 8(8) of the Young Offenders Act, s. 469 of that Act, or whether this Honourable court could conduct an independent review of that decision. 6)The jurisdiction for the decision of judicial interim detention of a youth charged with a murder under the youth criminal justice act rests exclusively with the Superior Court of Canada.

9_2011skpc15.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused is charged with mischief under $5,000 and aggravated assault. The major issue for determination is whether the accused can be convicted of both charges. HELD: The accused is guilty of mischief. 1)The mens rea required for s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code, is objective foresight of bodily harm. It is not necessary that there be an intent to wound or maim or disfigure. This is simply not believable. The accused was qualified in her denial of that. 2)With respect to the charge of aggravated assault, the inescapable conclusion is that the accused struck Mr. Cwynar in the facial area with the candle holder. The evidence is that only Ms. Fayant was present in the house. There is no suggestion that she gave him a backhand. 3)The evidence falls short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 4)The accused was very qualified in denying that she struck him. 5)The Crown has not proven the requisite intent to sustain convictions under s. 267 or s.268 of the Code. The Crown has established that the victim must be convicted. 6)The court reviewed the case of R. v. Creighton, [1993] S.C.R. 3. The Court concluded that when an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result.

b_2000skqb539.txt,"An application for a judicial review of a decision by the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Commission which held that the veering to the left by the two horses was within the tolerance of interference at the gate for two year olds. The Commission overturned the decision of the stewards and restored the horse declared to be in first place. In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed. The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence. The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual. 5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions. The decision of the Commission to refuse to give the applicants notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable. Their rights were affected by the decision. Bibeault was distinguishable. 6)The applicants were awarded costs.","This was an application by the applicants for judicial review of a decision of one of the respondents, The Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Licensing Commission. The applicants were the owners of two horses which were involved in the race.

HELD: The application was allowed and the matter was remitted back to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The applicants' rights were clearly affected by the decision and they were also irrelevant to the questions before the Court on judicial review. 2)The Commission did not give notice of the hearing and the decisions of the Stewards from other jurisdictions were inadmissible as hearsay.

He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The learned judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1) of the Code.

The sentence imposed did not properly reflect the gravity of the offence. This was a serious fraud accomplished by virtue of what the judge called 'a rather intricate kiting system.' A conditional discharge would do little to discourage others in Mr. Roberts' situation from undertaking similar sorts of criminal activity. 2)The sentence imposed was not properly reflected the gravity and gravity of his offence.  3)The conditional discharge was not appropriate for the circumstances. 4)Leave to appeal was granted and the Crown's appeal should be allowed.

The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had. HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest.

3_2003skqb532.txt,"The plaintiff employer sought injunctive relief and sought to enforce certain restrictive covenants and to restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any dealings with customers of the plaintiff or pertaining to equipment sold or leased to customers by the plaintiff. HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired. The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","HELD: The injunctive relief sought was granted on a quia timet basis and to enforce certain restrictive covenants, obligations of confidentiality and fiduciary duty binding on the respondents. The respondent failed to demonstrate a prima facie case or even a serious issue to be tried that it was in law entitled to more than two weeks notice or that the respondents were in breach of any right which accrued to Danka. The court found that Danka accepted the resignations without protest or comment and that the submission by Danka that despite its ejection of the employees from its premises they remained employees, the notice given was truncated by the respondents' request that the resigning employee leave the premises. The Court found that the injunctions were not enforceable on the part of the respondents and that there was no evidence of competition or solicitation nor any imminent danger or threat of such by one or more of the respondent employees so as to support the quia tari rationale for injunction relief. It was also found that, in furtherance of its expansion plan, the respondent purchased operations in Yorkton and Saskatoon in 2003 and retained Garry Huntington as its CEO in September 2003 once his non-competition agreement with Danka had expired. The respondents placed advertisements in Saskatoon and Regina newspapers to recruit personnel to fill the ranks of the applicant's expanding operation. In result, some 30 employees, primarily salesman and service technicians, took up employment with the respondent. HELD: 1) The injunctions are ordered on a quasi- timet basis. There is no factual foundation to provide credence for Danka's fear that wrongs will be done extraordinary relief by way of injunction will not be granted.  2) The affidavits of Danka employees Kohuch and Lazarowich, who were hired by Brennan Office Plus after the date of this Court's order from soliciting, directly or indirectly, the customers of the company and from performing any service work to equipment that was sold or leased by the company. 3) Injunctive relief until trial is necessary to protect Danka against irreparable damage and loss, mere inconvenience not being enough. The evidence is to the contrary in that the respondent put at least some of its former employees on notice of what its expectations were with respect to confidentiality and competition but no reference was made to any deficiency in the notice."
e_2015skqb412.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","FIAT: The applicant applies pursuant to s. 67 of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of all bills for legal services that Brabant and Company Law Office [Brabant] rendered to Cowessess within six years of the date of the application. The application proceeded on March 12, 2015. HELD: The application is dismissed. The information put forward here on which to direct an assessment is much more specific than the request itself and it is not fair. The applicant is a general practitioner who provided legal services over a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. There are a number of affidavits from former Chiefs and Council members confirming that the services seem to represent a large sum and expect the services to thereafter be scrutinized in detail.

8_1990canlii4256.txt,"Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.","The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. The evidence of the complainant was so consistent as to be relevant to her credibility. The Crown also called a social worker trained in counselling families and children. The social worker testified that she interviewed the complainant and others involved in the case and concluded that the child exhibited many of the symptoms often found in children who have been sexually abused, such as depression, attempts to block out recollection of events, low self-esteem, lack of trust in others and an inability to be specific as to details. The trial judge found that over the time period covered by the information he was left 'in little doubt that this was the case.' The admission of the hearsay evidence did not constitute an error so grave as to call for a quashing of the conviction. After considering the entire record, it concluded that it did not."
c_1996canlii5615.txt,"The appellant appealed his sentence of five months in prison to be followed by 18 months probation following his plea of guilty to the theft of his grandmother's car.

9_1999canlii12597.txt,"The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action. The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act (the “Act”) which: 1) restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the petitioner or his solicitors, in relation to the respondent’s claim in Queen”s Bench Action No. Q.B.G. No. 2270/97, J.C. Regina; and 2)rests the respondent from disposing of any of the monies that he has received or may have received or otherwise failed to use to support his family. The only requirement is that the disposition or wasting of the asset would impair or defeat the claim under the Act. The respondent argued that upon success in his Action the respondent would not voluntarily ensure that any claim under The Act is satisfied, because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. The court was prepared to arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000.00 will likely be sufficient security for the Act and lifted as against the Attorney general of Canada."

6_2015skqb138.txt,"Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","FIAT: The applicant seeks an order directing a trial to prove the 2013 will in solemn form. The grounds asserted by the applicant are that the defendant did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied that the applicant has not made out a genuine issue for trial. Accordingly, the application must be dismissed.  2) The court reviewed the specific evidence contained in the several affidavits filed in respect of this application. The court found that there was no evidence of irregularity or evidence on the peripheral points which will lead a Chambers judge to conclude that there is a sufficient issue for proof in solemn fashion.  3) The threshold for the challenge is reasonably low. The Court found that the application was reasonably low in that it was not necessary for challengers of will to present evidence that will convince the court as to the merits of their case. Rather, it was necessary only to satisfy the court that there a genuine issues to be tried with respect to the grounds on which the challenge was based, such as lack of testamentary ability or the presence of undue influence. 4) There was no question that the respondent did not possess the requisite testamentaries to carry out the required banking arrangements. 5) The test in Quaintance is, as is the general statement of the issue to be determined in Dieno, based in the context of jurisprudence respecting the wishes of the testator and the validity of the will. If there are suspicious circumstances that cast a measure of doubt on one or more of these legal requirements, such circumstances will affect the ability of the respondent to rely on the presumption. 6) There is no evidence that there has been an issue for the test in Ritchie. The evidence is brief but clear. It is not every suggestion that irregularity, evidence on peripheral points, such that the Court can summarize the admissible and relevant evidence from them. 7) It is important to note that the court was not provided with information as to when the meeting took place. 8) The respondent was not the only respondent to the challenge to the Will. The respondent had been friend of the deceased for several years, helping her out with chores and giving her rides when she needed them. When the deceased's health deteriorated, the respondent was unable to deal with the situation. 9) There were no questions as to whether the respondent knew the contents of the Will, freely approved of those contents and possessed the necessary"
2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.",This was an application under Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order in the nature of mandamus compelling the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The respondent had been a long term recipient of income assistance from the Department of Community Services. His assistance was terminated in May 2006 due to failure to disclose requested information. He re-applied for income assistance in 2007. His application was again denied based on failure to provide requested information and the respondent continued to refuse to reinstate eligibility from June 27 to September 7 as period covered by the order. HELD: The application was granted. The Court found that the respondent had the right to ignore decisions of the Appeal Board and its function would be meaningless if it did not comply with the Board's decision. The applicant shall have costs of $750 exclusive of disbursements.

The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial. The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access.

The paragraphs of the amended statement of claim at issue deal with the fact that the plaintiff alleges he was assaulted by the defendant and sustained bodily harm. The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings. HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings. In the civil proceeding, the plaintiff is in a position to control the presentation of his case and must prove his case on a balance of probabilities. The onus of proving self-defence is on the defendant.

The Court found that the defendant was entitled to proceed independently in subsequent civil proceedings against the same defendant. The defendant had no control of the proceedings and was required to answer the questions of crown counsel in direct examination and to respond to the questions posed to him. 6) There are different parties in civil proceedings from criminal and of course, a different burden of proof. In the criminal proceedings brought by the defendant, Mr. Windrem did not have control of his proceedings. He was simply witness for the Crown in unsuccessful criminal proceedings. As in all criminal cases, he was simply asked to answer questions of the crown counsel.

The applicant was given written notice of the substance of both allegations according to the disciplinary procedure set out in the regulations made pursuant to the Police Act, but in the space provided for the citation the notice cited only the regulation which dealt with the offense of being discourteous. A hearing before an inspector of the Police Department resulted in the applicant being found guilty of the offense of lying. She initiated a review by the Police Review Board which concluded that the section reference in the charge did not have to be accurate. The applicant brought this proceeding for judicial review and submitted that the Board's jurisdiction was limited by the citation of a particular regulation and to finding her guilty of the behaviour described in the regulation cited. Dismissing the application, that the failure to cite what the Board considered the proper offense in no way materially affected the procedural fairness of the hearings or limited the Board's jurisdiction. The applicant had complete notice of the nature of the allegations against her and was represented by counsel at the Board hearing. Certiorari will not issue for mere technical or trivial oversights and there was nothing patently unreasonable about the decision such as would warrant judicial intervention. On appeal","At issue was whether a police officer may overturn a decision made against her by the Police Review Board for the reason that the Regulation number by which she was charged did not precisely correspond to the number for which she had been found guilty. The officer argued that the section reference in the charge did not necessarily have to be accurate. Dismissing the application, that the officer had ample and continuous notice of the nature of the allegations against her and that she was represented by counsel. The failure to refer to what the Review Board considered the 'proper' offense in the original complaint was a technical defect only and in no way materially affected the procedural fairness of these proceedings."

After two years, the relationship between the Respondents and the Mother broke down and she left their home. The Respondents sought and were granted custody of the child. The Mother appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Respondents had sufficient interest under s.6 of The Children's Law Act to seek custody of the child. 2)The trial judge correctly determined that the only issue was the child's best interests, even in a contest between a parent and a stranger, although the parent/child relationship was one factor to be considered. 3)The findings of the trial judge were strongly supported by the evidence, the law was correctly applied, and therefore his decision ought not be overturned. 4)The matter was returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access.","The appellant, who is mentally handicapped, appeals the entrusting of custody of her 5 year old son to the respondents. The child and his mother were placed with the appellant and the respondents pursuant to Family Support Services Contract whereby the Harrises were to'spend individual time with' the appellant in supervising and teaching her to properly care for the child and provide for his needs. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Court's role is not to determine broad social issues but instead, to determine what custodial arrangement is in the child's best interest. This rule prevails even in contests between a natural parent and a stranger. The parental tie between mother and child is, of course, not to be ignored in such a contest. It is taken into account by the judge when considering the factors outlined in paragraph (i) of s.8. The trial judge's error as to the categorization of the appellant as needing level care when in fact the level is funding level and not a care level is not material as there exists other strong evidence, including that of the court appointed psychologist as to concerns about the mother's ability to care for her child and the risk to the child if he is left unsupervised for extended periods of time. Simply put, the trial judge was correct in his statement of the law that his duty was to determine custodial arrangements was in the best interest of the child."

The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","HELD: The court granted interim relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, and The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The court ordered an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favor of the petitioner.  1) The petitioner had established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children and that she was entitled to interim spousal support. 2) Given the short-term relationship and to add impetus to having the issues resolved sooner rather than later, the court ordered that these payments be paid for a total period of eight months. 3) There was no dispute that the petitioner and the respondent cohabited as spouses for in excess of 2 years. The fact that one is not the biological parent of a child does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide financial support for that child. However, given the short time relationship, a modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem. 4) The respondent was in a position to pay some monies at this time.

b_2000skqb106.txt,"SGI paid $47,427, the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, to the guardian of the three infant children of the deceased single mother. The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident. Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854. The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs. Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero. Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5).","The deceased single mother, who was unemployed and had no income, appealed the decision of Saskatchewan Government Insurance that the children were not entitled to any additional dependant child care benefits.

By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action. In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609.

As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs.

HELD: 1) The plaintiff and the defendants were entitled, with the consent of the defendants and the board of directors, to the initiation of derivative action by the plaintiff. The matter proceeded by conference call and written submissions. 2) As a corporation may only litigate with legal representation, there is a unity of interest between the plaintiff and 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. The nature of the action is such that Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of the 609. He was appointed for that purpose and is obligated to so instruct 609's counsel. Whether that counsel is Mr. Brehon, another member of his firm or someone from outside that firm is entirely matter for Henry. Such counsel is entitled to access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the actions, including preparation of a statement as to documents and following the modified discovery process set out in my earlier fiat. 3) It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations."

Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","An application for an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant.

An earlier Information, sworn on April 21, 2005 had been a basis for a prior warrant issued that day. The information contained incomplete and misleading information and the learned Justice of the Peace erred in concluding that the necessary grounds existed for the search.

4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine at Rocanville, Saskatchewan. HELD: The only remaining issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. The law is well settled that an employee is under an implied obligation not to compete with an employer during the term of his or her employment. An employee who submitted a bid for a food services contract in competition to her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of her employment contract. The plaintiff was entitled to no more than nominal damages. The court awarded $500.00. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred in characterizing the employee's actions as mere preparation. The employee competed with her employer for business which had been the employer's; her placing of the bid went beyond preparation. Although the plaintiff had telephoned the union hall and was told there were no members available for him to hire, he did not consider that to be confidential information or a trade secret."
8_2011skca35.txt,"The applicants applied for leave to appeal from a Chambers decision denying their application to dismiss the respondent's claim against them for want of prosecution. The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan. The building was substantially completed in 1970. In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building. In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss. In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief. In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer. The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997. Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held. In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant. Secondly, the issue of delays in litigation is important and the case will present an opportunity for the Court to clarify the legal framework pertaining to such matters.","The applicants are defendants in an action commenced by the Respondent, University of Saskatchewan. They applied to have the claim against them dismissed for want of prosecution but were unsuccessful. They now seek leave to appeal that decision. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted. 1) The Court found that the Court's decision to strike the claims against all of the defendants but the Applicants was not in the interests of justice.  2) There was enough merit in their position to warrant granting leave."
c_2013skpc37.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08. The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer. He did not receive a call back from his wife. The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available. The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid. After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call. The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape. The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio. The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action. There was no obligation on the part of the RCMP to provide the accused with a Prosper warning. The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer. The officer was justified in assuming that the accused was satisfied with the legal advice he had received. The Crown stayed the impaired driving count prior to the conclusion of the trial. The videotape evidence was not relevant to the .08 offence because all observations were made at roadside. The video would not have shown anything of relevance to the charge. There is no breach of the accused's rights under s. 7.

She had been involved in previous accidents and also suffered from osteoporosis and hypertension. She displayed some symptoms of mental illness, including paranoid delusions. HELD: The Plaintiff's evidence as to her condition was not accepted. Based upon the opinion of her doctor, the court found partial disability of 3 months, and that her symptoms were fully resolved within 1 year. The court awarded general damages of $18,000.00.  The court refused to award damages for loss of housekeeping capacity, given the Plaintiff's disability prior to the accident.","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident. Liability was not in issue. The plaintiff was 72 years old at the time of the accident and suffered from diabetes, osteoporosis and hypertension. Her injury was a whiplash injury which was substantially resolved over a period of about one year following the accident. The trial concerned the level of disability to which the plaintiff was entitled. The Court found that the proper level was at that time. The proper amount was $18,000. The court did not accept any evidence tendered in respect of the plaintiff's loss of housekeeping capacity as it would appear that she was substantially disabled prior to the accident, and such inconvenience as was suffered during the year after the accident was adequately compensated by the non-pecuniary damage award."

The respondent seeks an order that his child support obligations for their child ended July 2004 because their child ceased to be a person within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from his mother's charge. HELD: 1) The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February. He returned to high school in the fall of 2004. He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother. Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media. He is still under his mother's charge. She provides him with room and board. He is only 19 years old. He has been pursuing his education. The fact that he changed his course of study does not disentitle him to consideration for support. He is a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act. This will continue until March 2006 when he has completed his current course of study. 2) The respondent's income fluctuates. It is appropriate to take an average of the last 3 years to determine his income.  3) Some attention must be paid to the financial ability of each parent to contribute. After deducting the table amount, the respondent would have a gross annual income of $19,781.52. On that basis the court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall for the child, to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts. The guideline amount is the appropriate amount to be paid until the end of this year's study.","HELD: The Court found that the respondent was a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997 and that he had had that status on a continuing basis to the present time.

The father was to be reimbursed for any payments made subsequent to that date. The respondent was to remain under the mother's charge as he continued to live with her rent free and provided some additional assistance in the form of high speed internet access in order for him to continue with his studies.

The defendant and three others had set out to check a tuna pen. The boat was owned by a fourth individual, who was not present at the time. One of the men, despite having no experience diving with scuba equipment and being advised against it by the others, insisted on diving to check the pen. He died of drowning due to inexperienced scuba diving. Defendant not guilty of the offence charged; the defendant was not the deceased's employer. All four individuals thought of themselves as self-employed fishermen and had a profit-sharing agreement; the evidence did not establish that the defendant was acting as skipper or captain in the owner's absence; the defendant was not operating the vessel and the evidence did not show that the defendant had any kind of authority over the other fishers. The deceased was dependant on the boat's owner for the boat and part of the gear, for another individual for the licence and on the defendant for the balance of the gear; the relationship was closer to that of independent contractor than that of employer-employee.","The defendant was charged under s.13(1)(a) of the Nova Scotia Occupational Health and Safety Act with failing to take reasonable precautions to ensure the health and safety of persons at a workplace. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty of the offence charged. 1)The defendants thought themselves self-employed fishermen. They had a profit-sharing agreement pursuant to which 10% of gross was paid to the defendant, 10% to Harnish as boat share, 26% to Murphy and 26% for the defendant. The net profits would be divided equally among the four. 2)The evidence did not establish that the defendant was acting as skipper or second in command. It was Richard Heisler who was operating the boat. The defendant owned another tuna pen. Tuna could only be killed when Brian Coolen was aboard as he owned the tuna licence under which the four were fishing.  3)The Crown took the position that both the defendant and the plaintiff were employers for the purposes of the Act, but as the plaintiff was not present on the day of the accident, the Crown was to hold the defendant or any other of his co-fishers responsible for his health, safety and well-being. 4)The Court found that the defendants thought of themselves as self employed fishermen. All four thought themselves as'self-employed' fishermen. The evidence simply failed to establish that they were in any sense acting as the defendant's lieutenant or second-in-command. The Court found the defendant in any event acting in the manner prescribed by the profit sharing agreement. 5)If the legislature means to include fishers as employers or employees under this Act, it should do so specifically and inform the industry in advance of that change in policy. 6)The court found that fishers are not simply 'employees' in the normal use of that term. If the Crown is to make its case under s3(j) it will have to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Chad Zinck was economically dependent on the defendant; he was required to perform duties mainly for him and was in relationship with him that more closely resembled an employee relationship than that of independent contractor. The Crown's argument that he was acting 'dependent on someone else for his livelihood would be to arrogate to them degree of control they simply did not possess. 7)The defendant thought of himself as 'dependent contractor' under the Canada Labour Code, R.S.C. 1985, c.L-2 which found it necessary to provide specific reference to"
c_2002skqb155.txt,"The wife sought distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property. The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm. The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt.","The petitioner sought a distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. HELD: 1) The respondent sold his tractor and the proceeds were used to purchase the acreage. He now claims an exemption in that amount. 2) The farm machinery comprises a major portion of the family property. The respondent continues to live there. An appraisal of it and the out buildings was done and the report filed. Absent any evidence to the contrary, the petitioner accepted the valuation and found the tractor to be worth $43,000. 3) There appears to be an RRSP registered in the name of the respondent. However, as best I can make out, it was acquired prior to the marriage. Accordingly, the respondent should be paid $2,400 for the automobile and boat resulting in a total of $33,257.31. 4) In the circumstances, the farm machinery should be divided equally.  5) The petitioner had an automobile valued at $1,400.00 and a boat of value of $800.00. 6) An automobile was valued at approximately $500. The boat was valued between $100 and $200. 7) An auto was exempt. 8) The home was purchased in 1990. The petitioner received no benefit from these expenses. She received no income from the farm since the separation. 9) There was a claim for $16,500.00 which was said to be owing to the respondent for the Versatile 160 tractor. In the past the respondent owned a Case 800 tractor and a J.D. 400 mix mill. These were on-going expenses and related to the farm. The legislation does not permit such in respect to the family home in the circumstances of this case. 10) There were several debts and expenses which the respondent submitted to the court. He submitted to three appraisals; one which was done at the behest of the petitioner and two which were done at his behest. He was not convinced this was actually owing and therefore rejected the suggestion. 11) The tractor was purchased from an uncle's estate and was purchased many years ago. He did not contest either and confirmed the latter. He should bear no responsibility for the payments made and the equipment was subject to distribution. The Court declined to take them into account. The debts submitted by the respondent are statute barred and the Court did not take into account the value of the tractor."

That stay is in place until the hearing of the appeal.

This is so because Ms. Rees's means are very limited and thus there is a real possibility she would not be able to repay any 'overpayment' of support. 3)The appellant is paying ongoing support (spousal and child) of $12,726 per month and has taken $25,000 from the line of credit since October 2015.

After a decree nisi of foreclosure had issued but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners (the former husband) applied for judicial sale of the matrimonial home. The joint owners separated in 1999 and are involved in an acrimonious family law court action. The wife has exclusive possession of the property. The Credit Union as first mortgagee opposed the application. The co-owner did not participate. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)This is not the proper forum to attempt to affect a family property settlement. The husband was not entitled in these proceedings to a possession order. The wife prevented every attempt to show the property to prospective owners. There was no reason to assume she will be any more cooperative with a court appointed realtor. The Credit Union did not request immediate possession. 2)The court's entitlement to order a judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The court reviewed the history of the statutory authority for a judicial sale in a mortgage foreclosure proceedings. The 1852 Chancery Procedure Amendment Act was repealed in 1881 and replaced by Ordinance 51, Rule 1, which became law in the NWT by virtue of the Judicature Ordinance No.6 of 1893. It is now found in s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act in its modified form. Deciding whether it is 'necessary or expedient' within the meaning of s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act is, however, a judicial exercise.","After a decree nisi of foreclosure had been issued, one of the defendant registered owners applied for judicial sale of the mortgaged property, being the matrimonial home.

The court's entitlement to order judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The property was listed for sale by the applicant in February 2002 and subject to this application Border Credit Union is entitled to apply for a final order of foreclosure. This is not the proper forum to attempt to effect a family property settlement. The applicant is not entitled, in these proceedings, to a possession order.

The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and was sentenced to nine months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck used to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and deliver them. The truck was ordered forfeited. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the court was all of the view the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range but there was no basis for interfering with the sentence. A more significant issue was the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the vehicle used to transport the drugs. The sentence judge failed to consider the definition in the Act.  1) It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence and the Crown put street value on the drugs at between $2000 and $3000 with the respondent valuing them at slightly under $2000. 2) The truck had value of approximately $20,000. It was owned by the respondent and paid for through loan from his parents. The trial judge found that the truck was not 'integral' to the offence and he found the respondent was low risk to reoffend and of no real danger to society. He found the venture to be commercial one, albeit of small-time nature. He noted the respondent's depressed and remorseful nature. 3) There is no reference to proportionality in respect to personal property and it is only in regard to forfeiture of real property that the judge can take into account the impact of an order of forfeiture and whether it is proportionate to the nature and gravity of the offence, the circumstances surrounding the commission and the criminal record of the person charged or convicted. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.  4) The Court was all in agreement that the sentence was too low in relation to the operation of some 280 pills, a first-time offender with no previous criminal record, that the Truck was integral to this particular operation, aside from transporting him to various places across the country and if the member is innocent of any complicity in the offence or of any collusion with the offence (s. 19.1(4))."
2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The respondent Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) appealed its decision denying the worker's claim for recognition because his stress injury was not personal injury by accident (PECA) but rather a result of workplace events and stressors. WCAT concluded that there had been work related events or stressors in the workplace that were unusual and excessive, that is, in comparison to those experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The Policy clearly states that the workplace events are to be examined objectively in the sense required under the Policy and that such an approach was the correct one, both under Policy 1.3.6 and under the general law applying to GECA claims in Nova Scotia. 2) WCAT correctly decided that there were no stressors on which claim for work-related stress could be based. The Policy sets out the better view of the law and should be taken as declaratory of the principles to be applied in this regard to all stress claims under GECA. 3) The Court reviewed the history of the tribunal and found that the policy is consistent with the principles set out in the Supreme Court of Canada in Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC (CanLII). 4) The appeal turned on one main question: in deciding the worker’s gradual onset stress claim under the Government Employees Compensation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. G-5 (GECA), was the Workers’ Compensation Appeals tribunal wrong to assess the nature of the workplace stressors from an objective point of view? WCAT found that this reflects the law which was in place before the Policy came into effect in July 2005. At the heart of the appeal is whether WCAT was wrong to take this approach and if not, whether the policy applied it unreasonably to the worker. 5) The court reviewed the record to bring clarity to these issues. The policy provides that both gradual onset and traumatic event stressors are compensable under the GECA and set out the conditions under which each type of stress is compensable. The Court concluded that whether the Policy applied or not made no difference in this case. The decision of the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal in Rees, supra, reversed on other grounds sub-judgmental. The court found that WCAT did not err by considering whether there were workplace events (such as the employer's failure to accommodate him with respect to parking when he returned to work in 1999 following a back injury"

d_2007nspc68.txt,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams in one hundred milliliters of blood. HELD: The accused was not guilty of either offence. The Court found that the accused's acts involved the use of the car's equipment to turn the key in the ignition to the accessories position and to play music on the stereo. There was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or becoming a danger to the public."
4_2006skca76.txt,"The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","This was an appeal from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the order set aside. The court found that Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even direction of the trial of an issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.

No cross-appeal was filed by the City but the Board increased the assessment. The City then appealed to the Saskatchewan Municipal Board Assessment Appeals Committee to ask for a further increase. There was no-cross appeal by the owner. The Committee concluded the Board erred, having no jurisdiction to make an increase, and restored the original value. Leave to appeal was granted with respect to whether the Committee erred in making an order respecting issues not raised by the notice of intention to appeal; in ruling the assessed value cannot be increased where the board orders correction of errors in the assessment; if not, whether the Committee erred in jurisdiction in failing to apply s.263.2 of the Urban Municipality Act.

No cross-appeal was filed by the City, but the Board increased the assessment. The City appealed to the Saskatchewan Municipal Board Assessment Appeals Committee (SMBAC) to ask for further increase. The SMBAC refused. The land owner appealed the assessment to the Board of Revision of the city, alleging it to be too high, alleging the Board had erred, having no jurisdiction, as the matter had unfolded, to make an increase, and it restored the original value. The assessor appealed, claiming the Board erred in making an order where the board orders correction of errors in the assessment, which the Board did not do.

It then, as an appellate entity, was asked to affirm what was, in essence, a nullity. This it could do. While its procedure was flawed to some extent, it did not specifically raise the vires issue so as permit the City to make argument on it, its conclusion was correct. The issue of vires in the body below was open to it and indeed necessary to it to consider its conclusion. 2) Did the Committee err in law in ruling that the assessed value cannot be increased where the Board orders a correction of error in the Assessment? If not, then did the Committee er in jurisdiction in failing to have regard to and to apply s. 263.2 of The Urban Municipality Act, 1984 to order an adjustment in the assess to reflect the corrections?

The officer may not have drawn the presence of a telephone book to the accused's attention. The officer dialed the number for Legal Aid duty counsel for the accused and the accused spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel prior to providing breath samples of 190 milligrams and 180 milligrams. The accused never indicated that he wished to contact other counsel. HELD: Following a voir dire, the accused's application to exclude evidence was dismissed. The accused had not succeeded in establishing on a balance of probabilities that the accused's right to consult counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been violated. The accused was entirely disinterested in consulting with counsel as was his right and was clear and unequivocal in his waiver of rights to counsel. Alternatively, the accused failed to indicate a desire to exercise his right to counsel.","The accused was charged with impaired operation of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. He had alleged in that regard, a breach of his rights to counsel of choice under s. 10(b) and s. s. 24 of the Charter. HELD: The accused was released from custody on a voir dire basis. The evidence was applied to the trial proper. The accused abandoned his Charter application under ss. and thereof. The Court reviewed the evidence and concluded that the accused had not waived his right to counsel.

e_2000canlii19619.txt,"Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified. The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases. Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence. The Charter application for a stay of proceedings alleging a breach of fundamental justice is denied.","The accused was charged with 3 counts in relation to one incident occurring March 20, 1999 at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan: impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(b) and driving while disqualified. The Crown had met the necessary burden of proof with respect to the issue of identity and may not rely on the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all three counts. 1)The Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's driving was impaired by alcohol having regard to the test in R. v. Stellato. The impugned conduct affects only the weight to be given to the evidence of the Crown witnesses over that of the accused. In any event, the Court found that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that should compel the Crown to enter a stay of proceedings. 2)There was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of police witnesses with civilian witnesses during the trial. 3)The accused's behaviour was so reprehensible that it must be denounced regardless of the effect on the testimony at trial. The conversation complained of was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges before it. There was no bad intent on the part of the officers nor did there find tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the conversation."

Application for summary judgment granted. The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant.","Pricewaterhouse retained Allan Henderson as a contractual agent to value and liquidate the assets in favour of the creditors of Alternative Sports Limited pursuant to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and when he attended at the premises he found that the inventory was being loaded into a van and he was unable to gain possession of the assets. HELD: A summary judgment was granted and the plaintiff was entitled to receive reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements directly associated with removal and its liquidation, with detailed inventory and results of the liquidation to be filed with the court. 1)The facts based on the evidence by County Realty Limited, Muller very clearly was only intended to be a guarantor and the lease prepared by county Realty along with the evidence of Snow and the statement of legal fees strongly advances the plaintiff's position that he was only acting for the purpose of establishing a lease. 2)The mere statement by the defendant, that particular relationship exists does not constitute meeting the onus on the defendant to bring forth sufficient facts upon which the court could conclude that an arguable issue exists which ought to be tried. There are no facts advanced of agreement as to the term, none as to agreement on when the lease would commence, no consensus on the terms of any lease arrangement. 3)Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 states that summary judgment is granted to the plaintiff if he can prove his claim clearly and if the defendant is unable to set up a bona fide defence or raise an issue against the claim which is tried."
b_2010skca58.txt,"The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident. He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.",The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.

c_1997canlii1639.txt,"This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months. During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff. The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended. She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause. She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice. Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice, that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice. This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause.","This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal where the plaintiff contends that she was constructively dismissed without notice by her employer, the defendant. HELD: The Court found that an appropriate and proper period of notice was 8 months. The Court also found that the plaintiff had failed to militage on the basis of the employer's unilateral changes in the terms of her employment. The court found that if there was constructive dismissal, at what point did the plaintiff have notice of the changes which constituted constructive dismissal? 1)It was found that there was no evidence of the plaintiff's inability to find employment. 2)The Court awarded damages to the plaintiff based on eight months salary at the rate she was receiving at the time of her last employment with the defendant plus vacation pay at six percent per annum. 3)The court found no evidence that the defendant put forth a 'take it or leave it' proposition to her and it was one that she obviously could not accept. 4)It is important to note that the notice period is eight months. It is not unreasonable to expect that notice will vary with the circumstances for any particular case."
6_2012skqb275.txt,"The parties agree that joint custody is appropriate, but the petitioner mother asked that the principal residence of the two boys be varied and awarded to her. The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well. The children have been primarily residing with the father. The father has been in three motor vehicle accidents within three years and is facing criminal charges as a result of the most recent one. The father works long hours as a maintenance man. The mother has four other children from previous relationships. The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home. The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education. One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines.","The parents of two young boys, nine and 11, require a framework for parenting. Joint custody is not opposed. The father has had primary residence by interim order but that arrangement has been fraught with difficulty for reasons which will be explored. The mother, Sherri, asks that the boys' principal residence be varied and awarded to her. HELD: 1) The father is not entitled to the child tax credit. He abdicated a significant chunk of his care-giving role to his mother and sisters. His unfortunate injuries in the past two years have made him non-ambulatory and heavily dependent on others. There is no reason why this should be the case. 2) The court has regard only for the best interests of the child and for that purpose shall take into account: (i) the quality of the relationship that the child has with the person who is seeking custody and any other person who may have close connection with the child; (ii) the personality, character and emotional needs of the children; (iii) his ongoing benefits have been reduced from $1,600 to $500; (iv) the capacity of the mother to act as legal custodian of the boys; and (v) the extent to which the children are left with their mother, or their sisters. When the father was unable to care for the children, they were left with his sisters, or his stepbrother, who was having difficulty in school. 3) The parties met in 2000 when the mother was working in a bar in Eatonia. The parties lived together for six months and had three bedrooms in the basement one for Damion, one for Seth and one for Johnny. The boys did not bathe daily, sometimes only two times week. There were no boarders at the time of the accident. 4) The mother was not utilized as the caregiver of first resort by the father. She was not consulted by the mother as to her role as the mother's role in the children's relationship with the mother. 5) There are few rules in place. The only other outcome of the pre-trial conference was an agreement to pursue mediation. Mediation never occurred, purportedly because the father had been unable to afford it. There are red flags."

The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office.

The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","HELD: The court found that the respondent had the ability to pay child support and spousal support but that he had failed in his onus for the years 2005 through to 2012. The arrears from 2013 to date will be adjusted to reflect the income as found in the original order. When dealing with a request to vary, the court must accept the original court order was correct at the time it was made and allow the payor to escape his obligations if enough time elapses. 1)When dealing with an application to vary (see: s. 14 of the Guidelines), the Court must accept that the original decision was correct and that it was reasonable to have it expunged as a result of the lower income which is said to have been earned by the respondent. It must also determine whether material change has occurred requiring review of the order. 2)The respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made 10 years ago. The respondent has failed to establish that the imputed income has prejudiced him in some material way. The Court must also consider whether the respondent's onus is to justify the need for change."

At issue was were whether the arbitrator applied the correct measure of damages and whether there was any evidence to support the findings of fact. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed. The respondent's application for enforcement of the award was granted without costs. 1)The issues were questions of fact not law. The errors complained of were the same questions referred to the arbitrator for determination. Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law.

The contract provided that either party can refer any dispute respecting their contractual obligations to arbitration. The dispute arose between the parties respecting the performance of the contract and both parties agreed to resolution of the dispute by arbitration. They each retained legal counsel, agreed on an arbitrator, and defined the issues to be resolved. The arbitrator heard two days of viva voce evidence, admitted several documents as exhibits, received written legal briefs from counsel, and subsequently rendered a written decision that dealt with all the issues before him. The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed. The respondent's application for costs on a party and party basis was also denied. HELD: 1)The findings of the arbitrator with which the appellant takes issue are not questions of law but rather questions of fact. The appellant's submission refers extensively to the evidence presented. It constitutes in effect an invitation to the court to retry the case that was heard and determined by the arbitration judge. The scope of review of the award is limited to question of law. 2)The arbitrator's findings of fact do not involve 'questions of law' but rather involve 'question of fact.'

The mother was entitled to make a claim for support whenever she believed his contribution was inadequate, whether or not she perceived herself separated from him. 2)The primary purpose of a support order is not to compensate for past failure but to satisfy present need.

There was not a false statement in the proof of loss. 2)On the facts of this case the respondent's silence in the face of her uncertainty whether or not her brother had anything to do with the fire is not fraud. On the facts Mrs. J.'L. did not breach the duty of an insured to act in good faith even if that duty extends to the claim stage. The failure of the appellant to advise her sister of the possibility that the Nicholsons arranged the fire did not amount to fraud. 3)There is no evidence that there was an extortion when there was no evidence before him on which he could make this finding.
7_2010nssc146.txt,"The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","The accused brought an application for relief under s.24(1) of the Charter alleging that the Crown's intention to adduce the newly discovered evidence compromises her s. and 11(d) Charter rights. HELD: A mistrial was ordered following the hearing of a voir dire and a day and one-half of evidence in the trial proper. The accused gave up her right to challenge its admissibility, based on decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy. The Crown argued that the disclosure of evidence by the Crown can affect the accused's election with respect to mode of trial or to the plea. To that end, through her counsel, she agreed to have the video taped statement go in without contest. The trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the accused and would not be in society's interests generally because cases should be decided on all relevant and admissible evidence. The 'truth seeking' function of the court would be compromised if the court were to grant an order excluding evidence which the parties clearly recognize as important."
c_2002skca74.txt,"The appellant was unsuccessful in Queen's Bench in having his suspension and probation as a medical resident rescinded or to prohibit the Investigation Committee, which met on approximately seven occasions and interviewed seven witnesses, from taking further action. The Chambers judge refused to grant relief, finding the issues to be academic in nature and within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University, but ruled his supervisor should be removed from the Committee because of an apprehension of bias. The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure. He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. 1)The material did not meet the test for the admission of fresh evidence. It simply restated what was at issue and found to have had no effect. 2)There was no tenable basis for interfering. The remedies are discretionary. 3)The Court was not prepared to grant the relief in any event, given the long delay in seeking recourse. The initial concern was bias and jurisdiction. The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below. 4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations. Proceedings should not be allowed to be fragmented and should be allowed to run their course so the court has a complete record from the tribunals below.

It simply re-states what was already in issue below and found to have had no effect. The appellant's application is premature. 2)Given the long delay, including the delay in seeking recourse, and given the delay, it was not the committee's decision to ultimately dismiss the appellant if the recommendations were unfavourable."

The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation. The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal. There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which were subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act.

Specifically that they did not meet the requirements set out in s. 28(2)(b) of The Farm Land security Act. HELD: The application for relief was dismissed. 1)The defendant counterclaimed against the plaintiffs for rent owing from the plaintiffs as 'over holding tenants' 2)The wording of the defendant's offer to the plaintiffs was that both refer to a letter of commitment to finance; - not a 'letter of credit binding' the financial institution to advance money in any event. This was beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances, for the simple reason that banks do not issue letters of credit unless they are already secured or satisfied that the person on whose letter is to be issued is good for the money on an unsecured basis. 3)The plaintiff counterclaimed that the defendant had waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation by offering a different requirement for the exercise of the right to first refusal in its offer enclosed with the cover letter dated March 24, 1997. 4)The defendants counterclaim was dismissed with costs."

4_1994canlii4365.txt,"This was a petition for divorce with an application for settlement of corollary matters, especially custody and access. The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions. The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue. The mother sought sole custody with generous access. The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say. Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues. As the parties lacked flexibility, a detailed access plan was incorporated.","The parties separated in June 1992. They have two children, Conor and Braden. The parties have been married for eight and half years and have two adult children, ages 7 and 12. The father seeks equal parental control and responsibility by an order for joint custody under s16(4) of the Divorce Act. The mother proposes sole or joint custody, allowing him to be the final decision maker in matters relating to the children's welfare, growth and development while being prepared to promote maximum contact between the children and their father to the extent that this is consistent with the best interests of the children. The Corollary Relief order shall reflect the parties' agreement for each parent to hold in trust and administer one-half the investments; specific access; and quantum of child maintenance. HELD: 1) The Court found that the present joint custody arrangement was not working on a day-to-day decision making basis. The Court ordered that both parents continue to share equal rights and responsibilities for major matters affecting the children, specifically in the areas of formal education, religion and major health issues, while ordering the mother to have sole responsibility and decision making authority for the day to day physical and mental care and control of each child and the father generous access.  2) The court found that there was no pressing or immediate difference of philosophy or opinion between the parties in these major areas. It ordered that the parties continue to have equal access and responsibility for all matters affecting their children, including parenting, education, social and emotional development, and the effect upon the children of exposure to on-going custody litigation."

He was treated at the emergency department of the Victoria General Hospital for an hour. He did not inform the doctors as to the length of time he had been impaled. Upon his release he was advised to watch for any infection. He was not issued antibiotics. The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg. He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence. Dismissing the action, that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way. While the defendants underestimated the nature and extent of the injury, they provided a recognized method of treatment based upon the knowledge they had. The real fault lies with the plaintiff who failed to reveal fully what had happened to him.","The plaintiff alleged negligence by the two defendants medical doctors and claims damages arising from the negligence. HELD: The plaintiff's case was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendants and each of them did not fall below the standard of care required of them in their treatment of the plaintiff. Further the plaintiff's loss is not attributable to any of the acts of the defendants but rather is the direct result of the injury he suffered. 2)On the totality of evidence, it is clear that the injury was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way.

Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower. The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D & S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. It is alleged that the defendant failed to perform as agreed and in consequence the plaintiff seeks damages. The defendant resists the claim and by way of a counterclaim seeks judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) The construction was completed four months late. There was a discussion about round pillars and it was intended that they would be a part of the contract. The plaintiff adopted the suggestion and the construction was done. 2) The boiler room was not part of a contract but was clearly an extra ordered. The contract contemplated that there would be extras but it did not speak to their cost. 3) The plaintiff was liable to pay for the work. He was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost and he in fact did so. 4) The Steam Room was completed 4 months late and the plaintiff was awarded one-half of that loss or $1,400.00.  5) Costs of Performance were to be valued on the basis of cost of performance (of bringing the system up to standard originally intended) and not in the diminution in value of the building (the difference between the commercial value of a plant as built and as it ought to have been built). 6) The cost of $5,900 was to be recovered from the defendant. 7) Although there was disagreement as to what was the cause of the delay, it was attributable to both parties equally.  8) The Court was satisfied that the plaintiff and the defendant discussed building a steam room in the master bedroom. The contractor suggested that this be done and he estimated that the cost would be about $3,000.  9) The defendant did not press on as he might have. He did not ensure the program of construction was clearly defined and adhered to. Only an estimate was provided and some tolerance should be allowed. The amount of $6,097.82 was the actual cost of the house. 10) The delay postponed the completion of the project by four months. Costs of performance are to be preferred as the measure of damages, but reasonableness may require a different approach including diminution of value.  11) The Costs of Exercising Extras The plaintiff paid $4,000 for the boiler room and $41,007.83 for the steam room.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence. Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence. The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.  2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838). However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba). A properly instructed jury could have arrived at the same inference on the facts as found.","The accused was convicted of driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs contrary to s. 255 and 253 of the Criminal Code.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge's findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment by alcohol are supported by the evidence. The inference made by the trial judge is one that a properly instructed jury could have arrived at on the facts in the instant case and therefore should not be interfered with. 2)The judge made no palpable or overriding error in her assessment of the evidence, her interpretation of the law or her application of the applicable law to the evidence and the fact that the accused was in care or control of the motor vehicle at the time he was in the driver's seat."

Subject to the parties reaching a different agreement, there shall be an order that the child continue in kindergarten in North Battleford up to and including December 2004. Commencing in January 2005, the child shall attend a new school in the community where the parents reside. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs on double Col. 5. 1) The Court has signalled its reluctance to interfere with the discretion of a chambers judge when dealing with matters of this nature. Only if the chambers judge abused his discretion by acting on some wrong principle, by disregarding some material matter of fact, or by failing to act judicially is the Court of Appeal at liberty to interfere. 2) It is not our function to fine tune orders such as this one particularly when they are of such short duration. We have reviewed the voluminous affidavit evidence in the record and find no misuse of judicial discretion. The order under attack is considered an attempt to manage the situation for a short period of time."
d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The petitioner sought an order under The Dependents' Relief Act (DRI) varying child maintenance from $150 per child to $1,245 per month for the two children.

8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan on December 1, 1993. At trial, counsel for the respondents advanced standard criminal law defences to the charges, and also a constitutional defence that the respondents as Metis had an aboriginal right to fish for food. The trial judge found the accused not guilty on counts 1, 2 and 6, supra, based on the standard defence of aboriginal rights. He found he would have convicted the accused on counts 3, 4 and 5 but for the constitutional defence which he had found to be established. The acquittals were the subject of a Crownappeal. HELD: 1)The Crown's case includes an allegation of commercial fishing, since if it does not, several of the accused's arguments may not be necessary. 2)The Court found that the Crown intended not by word or action to make commercial fishing the constitutional issue at least prior to their brief which gave rise to this motion. 3)It is the Crown's position that commercial fishing is not an issue in this case. It is the proper characterization of the aboriginal right one of fishing for commercial purposes because the offences with which the accused were charged did not relate to commercial fishing but applied whether the fishing was for domestic consumption or for a commercial purposes. 4)The accused was found not guilty of all charges."

1990canlii4096.txt,"This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","This was an application by the applicant for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against him in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (I.D.A.). The application for certiorari was joined with an application for an order restraining the Bar Society from ordering disciplinary action against McFetridge in the event that he was found guilty of professional misconduct. HELD: Application for interim injunction granted. 1)The test of an injunction is not applicable and that the court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very special circumstances. 2)The circumstances that Mr. Ripley was found to be in did not meet the test. 3)The application for interim injunctive relief was granted without costs.  4)The applicant had established that there was a serious question to be tried before an inferior tribunal where those proceedings were 'abusive or vexacious'.  5)If the American Cyanamid test were to be applied, the applicant would have satisfied the requirements for a interim injunction."

When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and cocaine for the use of trafficking both under s.5(2) and with trafficking of property obtained by crime. The accused had a knapsack with him and a backpack which he placed at his feet in the front passenger seat. The police officers seized the backpack and at subsequent search at the police station it was found to contain: an unopened bottle of Olands Export Ale, 232 grams of cannabis marihuana, 63 grams of cocaine, bundles of cash containing $3000 in total, a digital scale, a black wallet, a toothbrush and deodorant. HELD: The accused was guilty of all three charges before the Court. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from all of the evidence was not only that the knapsacks were in the personal possession of the defendant but that, because the cocaine the defendant handed to Hyslop came from the same bag as large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and all the circumstances establish that the possession was for the purposes of trafficking. The Crown did not call evidence but argued that the circumstances leading to an inference of possession vary so widely, each case turns on its own facts and other cases are useful for illustrative purposes at best; thus, although reviewed the cases supplied by the defence, find no need to refer to them directly. In proving constructive possession, the Crown must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had knowledge of the presence of the item in question, consented to its presence and had some measure of control over it. The fact that the backpack was not secured by lock even though a small lock was attached to the front of the backpack made it a reasonable inference that these rolls of cash were proceeds of drug trafficking. Hence, the accused had them in his possession knowing that they were obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment."

His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed.

The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met. The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them. Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional. Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future.","HELD: The Court found that the children were in need of protective services and that they were the offspring of three (3) or four (4) fathers.

The Agency was to provide transport and money to secure O.D.'s diaper rash lotion as well as product to deal with the children's infestation of head lice. The Children's Aid had made a referral to Children’s Aid when the Agency was expecting its second child, S.M., who had some form of special needs or developmental delay.

The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision.

The lengthy delay between the plaintiff's awareness of the symptoms in 1976 and her suit in 1993 could not simply be due to lack of a medical-legal report; (b) there were a number of limitations issues, some of which were common and others that were individual to the class members; and (c) the Crown had breached its fiduciary duty and trust obligations that it owed to the plaintiffs and other Indians who served in the Armed Forces by systematically discriminating against Indian war veterans and their dependants by improperly administering benefits and in failing to properly carry out the obligation placed on the Crown to protect the rights of Indians. (d) The plaintiffs were persons whose same sex partner had died before January 1, 1998 and after the enactment of the Charter in 1985; (e) there was nothing before the court to indicate that they were not properly informed of their right to apply for veteran's benefits; (f) the court should be reluctant to deny plaintiff his or her day in court; (g) the test in Canada governing the application of provisions like Rule 19(24)(a) of the British Columbia Rules of Court is the same as the one that governs an application under R.S.C.

d_2005skca149.txt,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his youth sentence when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Justice Court for review under s. 103 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The Crown appealed her decision and argued that, on a proper reading of the YCJA, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. The Youth Court judge held that the sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The court accepted the Crown's argument and found that the youth court judge erred in her interpretation of s. 107(1)(b). For the reasons which follow, that the Youth Court decision is subject to appeal.  2) The purpose of the youth justice court is to ensure that young people are able to escape community supervision without consequence.  3) There is no reference to s. 102(2)(b) in the Youth Code. Section 103(2) is the word 'apprehension' in the context of breach of community supervision orders. It is included in s. 106(1) in order to give the reader a sense of what s.107 is about without requiring him or her to actually turn to the section. There is an obvious modification of s102(2), which ""the circumstances require"" when, as per s102, it applies in the Context of a Breach of Community supervision Order. Section 102(3) includes the word “Apprehension” in the opening marginal note to s107 and the substitution in their place of reference is to s102. In this case, the youth was apprehended and, until the young person is apprehended, he or she is deemed to be unfit to serve the youth sentence the youth person is serving.  4) The youth was found not guilty of an offence for which the punishment provided by the Criminal Code or any other Act of Parliament is imprisonment for life, three years from the date of this order.  5) The Youth court judge focused unduly on the provincial director's lack of authority to'suspend' community supervision under s102 and the contrast in this regard with the power of"

The parties agreed that it was in the best interests of the child that the Father and the child continue to have contact and access with each other, regardless of the marriage of the Father or the Mother to, or the adoption of a child by, someone other than the Father. HELD: 1)The weekly telephone access shall continue each month for a period of four hours and two days for two days in the months of March or April 1998 for the same number of hours and 2 days in June 1998 for two weeks in the summer of 1998 at the father's parents' farm residence including overnight access. 2)The father was to be reintroduced to his daughter in a gradual and consistent fashion. 3)Weekly telephone access was to continue one day every two weeks for two months in March and April/May 1998 for a total of two weeks. 4)The parties could not agree upon ongoing access. They once again appeared on February 25th, last. The father argued that he should be granted access every second weekend, every second Christmas and Easter and 2 weeks in summer, all unsupervised. He admitted that he could only exercise any access rights two or three times per year. In his opinion, David Wolbaum's generous and far-reaching requests are not reasonable at this time given his lengthy record of non-contact with his daughter. It is important that he be introduced to her daughter in gradualand consistent fashion in order to prevent her activities from interfering with his activities."
e_1984canlii199.txt,"The Plaintiff contracted to provide market survey to the Defendant. Before its completion, the contract was replaced by second contract for Fund Development Officer. Each party had a different understanding of the duties of the Fund Development Officer which misunderstanding the Judge classified as a mutual mistake. The failure of performance by plaintiff entitled defendant to repudiate the contract. Defendant's counterclaim for rescission of first agreement, and repayment of monies paid under second agreement, failed where it accepted plaintiff's performance and paid consideration therefore.","This was an action brought by Fossil Fuel Development Ltd. against Tudex Petroleums Ltd. (Tudex) for breach of contract claiming damages. In its counterclaim, Fossil seeks rescission of the contract and agreement relating to the market study. The dismissal of Fossil's action effectively releases Tudex from any further obligation under the contract of June 2, 1981. The repudiation of contract by Tudex is legitimized. So an order for rescission is not necessary. The defendant, having accepted the performance by the plaintiff on the marketing study and paid the consideration therefor, there is no basis for rescissions of the agreement pertaining thereto."
b_2012skqb443.txt,The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their children. The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.,"FIAT: The application at bar is another salvo in a bitter custody and access dispute. HELD: 1) Settlement negotiations are protected by settlement privilege. This privilege is fundamental to the policy interest of promoting settlement discussions as means to avoiding trial. It should only be set aside if there is a very compelling, competing policy warranting such a proposal. As settlement communications are almost always irrelevant to the issues that are properly considered by the Court, it is rare that there will be any competing policy or, indeed, any reason to reference them at all. A party cannot unilaterally waive privilege even on the proposal he made because it is not his to waive. It is a jointly held privilege. 2) The respondent exhibited a letter to his counsel that was from his counsel to the petitioner's counsel. The letter was marked 'Without Prejudice' and began with: 'My proposal is reasonable so must be good, reasonable parent; by failing to accept that reasonable proposal, she must be unreasonable and, therefore, not as good parent.' The letter goes on to set out a detailed offer of settlement."
b_2005nssf21.txt,"The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the irproperty. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","HELD: The parties agreed that a Joint Custody Order would be issued and that primary care would remain with the mother. The parties did not seek periodic or lump sum support but rather a lump sum payment to cover her tuition at the Atlantic School of Theology. The court considered s. 18 of the Matrimonial Property Act and found that the children's best interests were served by remaining in the matrimonial home with their mother.  1) The court reviewed the economic circumstances of the marriage and concluded that it was a 'patrimonial asset' and must be divided equally. 2) The piano lessons and musical instruments were extraordinary expenses for extracurricular activities and were necessary and reasonable. 3) There was no evidence that the father had any interest in the property since marriage. The couple considered it to be a business asset and valued it accordingly. 4) The Court considered the position of both parties on value and the reasonableness of the expense, having regard to the means of the spouses, and those of the child, and to the family's spending pattern prior to the separation. The Court found that there was no basis for an unequal division as listed in s. 13 of the Act. 5) The children were awarded joint custody of the three (3) children. Day-to-day primary care was with the father and the mother was to have access on specific terms. The father was to pay basic guideline support for the children in the amount of $650 per month. 6) The father's access to the children every second weekend was to include Sunday until 6:00 p.m.  7) The mother's access was to be in the father's name only. 8) The parents were to have regular access for the balance of the Christmas school break. 9) The son was to give notice of the activity and the cost of the tuition. 10) The wife was to provide notice of her contribution to the mortgage and the monthly spousal support. 11) The parties were to share joint custody with the children."
8_2007skpc1.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy was a stay of proceedings. HELD: The Court found the accused suffered actual prejudice because the outstanding charge has affected her ability to apply for higher-paying job opportunities, and has caused her stress and frustration. The passage of time makes it more difficult to properly defend against the charges. The accused did not contribute to the remaining delay. There were some delays attributable to the accused in time until she was ready to enter pleas, and later until her ready to have the matter rescheduled for trial, delays which were deducted from the time she appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charges set for trial."
3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of his cattle getting into the plaintiff's canola field in late July, 1999. The plaintiff admits that his cattle were in the Plaintiff's crop on one occasion. The defendant says that there is no evidence that his cows were in that crop on any other occasion, and that such loss as was caused by his cattle is minimal. HELD: Judgment in the amount of $2,533.45 was granted. Under both the present s.27 and the pre-1977 statutes, the cattle owner is strictly liable for damage caused by the straying cattle. The current s.28 (1) has been in the Act since 1977, when the Act was substantially re-written, apparently in response to the increasing urbanization of the province. The legal situation was the same -- the cattle owners are strictly liable."

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action. The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution.","The bankrupt sought an order of disbursement of $1,750.00 from the Revenue Canada for a failed agreement and lease of his former business Red Bull Enterprises Ltd. He contended that the failure was caused by a protracted dispute with the Department of Highways over the right of Red Bull to occupy land owned by Highways. The bankrupt contended that s.173(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act prohibited the disclosure of this information. HELD: 1)There was no evidence that the principle and exemption contained in s.295(5)(a of the Excise Tax Act would allow disclosure of the bankrupt's personal tax returns. 2)The bankrupt's evidence was that it was their own fault he stopped making payments because they didn't do what he wanted them to do. 3)The court reviewed the possible orders that may be granted under s.172 of the Act indicating that the decision need not necessarily be of final nature. 4)The first preliminary objection raised by the bankrupt relates to certain paragraphs of the affidavit of the common law spouse being based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge. 5)Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules requires affidavit evidence must be based upon personal knowledge and disclosure is improper for these proceedings. 6)The Court was not convinced that the objections to the discharge were final in nature."

Defendant sentenced to fine of $25,000, from which the sum of $15,000 shall be paid to the Canadian Farmers' Disability Registry; defendant ordered to perform 160 hours of community service with respect to farm safety. The defendant was an individual and not a huge corporation, had been conscientious about safety issues prior to this incident and had endeavored to improve safety at his farm after the incident; the deceased had also failed in his responsibilities under the Act and was working with a significant blood alcohol content.","The defendant farmer, who owned and operated a family dairy farm, pleaded guilty to an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act for failing to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons at the workplace. The defendant's guilty plea relates to the fact that on August 13, 2006, one of his employees, Gary Boake, died in a manure pit. The farmer's responsibility to safeguard employees from risks associated with that manure pit arises under s. 13(1) of the Act. The facts establish that the defendant was conscientious about safety issues before August 2006 and had endeavored to address and improve safety at his farm since the tragedy of Boake's death. He was in no condition to be operating equipment, which he needed to do to remove manure to the manure pit, and placed himself at risk. He had made substantial changes to the farm since his death, including building a new dairy barn. These plans were in the works before the tragedy but were informed by this tragedy. The farming community was informed by the tragedy and the farmer's knowledge of addressing farm safety issues can assist in preventing the loss of another life, which at least will mean that he will not have died in vain. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to a total penalty of $25,000. 1)It is material to me as well that the evidence in Exhibit 1, containing diagrams and photographs of the defendant's farm, and the submissions of Mr. Yuill indicate clearly that Mr. Sutherland was conscientious in his safety concerns before and after the tragedy. His blood alcohol concentration was significantly over the legal limit for operating any kind of vehicle. 2)The penalty is a significant penalty for failure to take reasonable precautions to address the problem of the damaged barricade having been removed. 3)The defendant's failure was in not arranging for an alternative to use the pit, alternatives that did exist on the farm at the time."

The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.  Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father. The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay. The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77. Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs.","The parties litigated the apportionment of custody and access rights and the quantification of child support and special expenses for their two children. The respondent, the successful party, sought costs of $3,000 based on an application of Scale of Tariff “A” of the Costs and Fees Act, supra. The tariff is reproduced following Rule 77.18. The court imputed an income level to Mr. Williams that Ms. Pellicer was prepared to accept prior to the commencement of the hearing ($25,000) and assigned an additional one half day of Court time to this aspect of the case. On the important parenting issue, the evidence established that the Applicant was the appropriate primary care parent. The assessment of the child support was a central issue. Income was imputed to the respondent by the Court. He did not persuade the Court to reduce his child support obligation. The matter required court time on two days and additional chambers time when the Court was required to resolve disagreements between the parties. The Applicant was awarded costs in the amount of $1,000. Costs were assessed against the respondent with costs to be paid at rate of $150 per month until paid in full, 2012 NSSC 267 (CanLII).

However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received.

d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order requiring the defendant to serve pre-certification notices to all persons who travelled with the plaintiff during the purposed class. The motion was dismissed with costs. HELD: The application for examination was dismissed.  1) It is important to remember that we are in the pre certification stage of this proceeding and this is still an 'action' and not a 'class action'. This is still a 'action'; this is a 'conspicuous' proceeding and the Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when the relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications in some other lawful manner. 2) The court is not prepared to broaden the scope of the court's decision to allow for examination of Ms. Moore. The usual practices and application of the common law regarding civil litigation apply. The practices and the implementation of The Rules of Court in this case were not designed to restrict the application for cross-examination of potential plaintiffs. 3) There is nothing in the Act that could be interpreted as unfair. The actual purpose of examining the plaintiff is not to challenge her version of the circumstances leading up to the signing of the alleged settlement agreements by the Roussys, but rather a more general and broad ranging interrogation of her about other customers who may have booked through her office with Red Seal at the relevant time of this case. The examination may even be more broad ranging than that and could be an attempt via Ms.'s office to get information from Red Seal itself as to its customer data base that Red Seal may have regarding customers that may be booked through Red Seal's office. 4) The Court's usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for plaintiff to demand that defendant produce a proper representative plaintiff. It is not necessary in this situation for the Court to look past the clear wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of the Class Action Act to make the requested order for disclosure of documents. The practice and implementation of the rules of court in this context is still very much in the infancy stage of the class action process. It would be unfair if the Court could only examine the plaintiff within weeks of filing the requested affidavit as opposed to providing their own evidence.  5) It would essentially not make sense for defendant to have to produce a plaintiff.  6) The purpose of the application is to give the plaintiff an opportunity to put forth evidence regarding this alleged settlement and give the plaintiffs a chance to reply."
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year.

Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out.

At the time of the judgment, the respondent had been diagnosed with breast cancer and had had surgery followed up by radiation. She was receiving social assistance in the amount of $14,000 annually. The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining Catherine on the basis that she was over 18 without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) It was incumbent on the respondent on the review application to establish she was unable to become self sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and in fact showed that she had made no effort at all to do so within the year allocated by the Ottenbreit order and prior to the filing of the notice of motion, and little effort between that time and the hearing of the application. 2) The order of Sandomirsky J. is set aside and the respondent is ordered to pay $600 per month. 3) The respondent's application for costs is dismissed."

HELD: 1)Where the Minister has received a request in the proper form and determined, with the approval of the Governor in Council, that it is necessary to lease a school building in order to meet the Province's statutory obligation, the cost is the responsibility of the Province. The lease costs are to the same extent as would be supplied by the building free of costs. It would not include those expenses associated with operating the building. Absent the report, under s. 33(7)(d) and s. 15(1) of the Education Act, there is no obligation on the Province to fund the leasing of buildings for school purposes. 2)Where there is an inequity where it is required, in the order to deliver the basic public school program, to lease buildings from third party, in this case the Church, while other boards are provided buildings free of rental cost. It may be that the Minister may wish to reconsider whether, pending the possible filing of a report by the Province, additional interim funding is warranted in these circumstances to cover the present and future costs of these leases."
7_1996canlii7107.txt,"The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600. The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amount of on-going maintenance of $600 per month for his 2 daughters. An order suspending enforcement of arrears during periods when the respondent is unemployed was granted. HELD: 1)The father was ordered to pay child support of $300 per month during months when his gross monthly income is $2,200 or greater and $150 per month when his adjusted gross income is less than $2200. The father was to pay $200 per month on arrear in addition to the on-go child support obligation. 2)The respondent was to be paid $200.00 per month per child during the years 1995 and 1996/97/98/98. 3)The Court ordered the father to pay monthly child support $300.00 for the two daughters and $200 for each child in the event of a decrease in their gross monthly incomes of $1,200 and $6,257 income tax refund garnisheed for a total of $11,611."
b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that reserve on the matter of costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The applicant argues that the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and that the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: The application for fixed costs is dismissed.  1)The court's discretion to award costs arises out of its inherent equitable jurisdiction and out of Rule 542 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court. Rule 184C of the Queen’s Bench Rules allows the court to take into account offers of settlement that do not meet the requirements of the Act. 2)The applicant was awarded costs in lump sum. The court was faced with two equally untenable positions in determining the costs. The first was that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance for Jade based on the needs-based approach. The respondent argued that the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The second was that there was no evidence before the Court at trial that substantial offers were made by counsel for the parties and that there should be a fixed award of costs in order to avoid taxation. 3)The Court was asked to consider whether the applicant was acting reasonably during negotiations and whether the issue of costs was a genuine one. The Court was awarded fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000, together with disbursements. 4)In fixing costs, the court reviewed the principles in Nalder v. Hawkins (1833), Myl. K. 243; 39 E.R. 937 in Re Champ (1986), [1926] and [1957] W.W. R. 85 (Q.B.A.). 5)Rule 343A contemplates an amendment to the judgment in these circumstances. It contemplates a change in the wording of the order so as to carry out what was intended or to reconsider or withdraw the decision so long as the order has not been perfected."

The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order that determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the respondent's pension plan during negotiations which took place during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with brief written reasons to follow. 1)There was no contract that the judge could enforce. The intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or instalment basis must be clear in order to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but nothing in the evidence indicates such an intention in this case.  2)There were no contract provisions in the Queen's Bench Act."

The applicant applied to determine whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia concerning the Quebec accident and to dismiss the action on the basis that Nova Scotia was a forum non conveniens. Application to dismiss the action dismissed; the forum conveniens is Nova Scotia. The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens. The substantive law governing the proceeding will be the law of the place where the accident occurred and the governing procedural law will be the law of the place of the trial.","The application was for directions as to procedure to govern the future course of conduct of trial pursuant to C.P. Rule 25.01. The sole issue was whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia regarding the motor vehicle accident which occurred in the Province of Quebec. The applicants did not really make any submissions of substance concerning forum non conveniens and at the same time the applicants have not provided a lot of information about the circumstances surrounding the accident such as whether there were any witnesses and where they may be resident; whether any of them were seen by doctors; if so, where they were located and whether they might be called to testify at trial. HELD: The application was amended to include an additional claim for costs. 1)The substantive law which governs will be the law of the place where the injury occurred. 2)Nova Scotia is not forum conveniens. Nova Scotia is a forum non-conceiens. 3)If there is a procedural problem, a problem arising from a procedural law, before or during trial, that problem will undoubtedly be determined in accordance with the procedural law of a place of trial, and that is Nova Scotia. 4)The applicant did not have a prima facie right to select the forum of his choice. This right was subject to the defendants' right to try to establish that the forum chosen is forum non non convenien and that more convenient forum exists elsewhere. 5)If the plaintiff has chosen Nova Scotia, following the next rule, unless the defendant, that is the applicants here, can show that Nova Scotia isn't forum a conveniens, the plaintiff's choice of jurisdiction of forum will govern. In the absence of so many facts about the accident and the witnesses likely to be called on behalf of the defendant and witnesses, that was the focus of the arguments that were raised in those briefs. 6)The court reviewed the contents of both your briefs and concluded that the only question that the plaintiff had to choose was whether Nova Scotia was a forum for conveniens in the alternative to determination of the question of question of law and, secondly, to dismiss the action because Nova Scotia would not be a forum. 7)The Court granted the applicant some costs even though it has been unsuccessful on the issue of forum non"

The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent.

Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along a highway in the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia. At the time his driver's license was revoked, he was driving a prohibited vehicle on the highway under s. 11. The defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2) do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since his 'driver's license' was revoked.

c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge found the accused guilty of dangerous driving and assault. The court found that the accused intentionally drove in a manner which he knew created a danger for others, and drove in such a manner intended to scare the complainant. The evidence was nonetheless reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge's decision. The appeal from the dangerous driving conviction must also be dismissed. 1)The trial judge correctly identified the law in Saskatchewan in relation to the de minimis non curat lex principle and did not substitute its own view of the evidence. 2)The appellant's final argument was that the judge failed to give effect to implied consent and in adopting a zero tolerance approach to domestic violence. The appellant conceded that all elements of an assault offence under s. 266 of the Criminal Code had been made out, but that his conduct was a marked departure from the conduct expected of a reasonably prudent driver and not a momentary lapse."
e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. The Lawless have an English speaking background. They attended an English language school for two years. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children's provisional approval to attend a French language school would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The family applied for an interlocutory injunction, alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. HELD: The application to dismiss the claim was reserved. The court found that it was in the best interests of the children to continue attending the school. The Court found that the CÉF had failed to meet its obligations under s. 42 of The Education Act."
4_2000canlii2523.txt,"The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval. In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","The applicant land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The development officer declared the application incomplete. The applicant sought an order in the nature of certiorari quashing the development officer's decision and declaring the application was in fact complete. HELD: The application for final approval was declared incomplete.  1)The Municipality relied on s. 278 of the Municipal Government Act in its submission that the higher road standards were applicable to this Application. 2)The applicant received a tentative approval before the new road standard was incorporated. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring the same road standards as they existed at the time it received the tentative approval. 3)The application was incomplete. Technically in the case at bar it was not refused. The application was simply declared incomplete and the applicant is entitled to a declaration that the application is complete. 4)The municipality relied upon s. 283 of the municipal Government Act. The Municipality relies upon s278 of the MGI Act. S. 283 represents the legislator's effort to protect developers exactly like the Applicant who received tentative approval under one regime and are to be protected from any subsequent changes.  5)It is significant that the right of appeal is from a refusal to approve a concept plan or a tentative or final plan of subdivision on the grounds that the decision of council or the developer, as the case may be, does not reasonably carry out the intent of the municipality, and conflicts with the provisions of the land-use bylaw or the subdivision bylaw."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff was the successor corporation of an amalgamated corporation which included Sweeney Limited, Yarmouth, Nova Scotia based company involved in catching, processing and marketing of fish and fish products. The defendant entered into a letter agreement whereby the defendant would represent its share of the plaintiff's energy savings, the plaintiff taking the position that such savings were entirely unrelated to any advice from the defendant and were, instead, the result of price reductions offered by its own suppliers of fuel. The plaintiff paid the defendant what the defendant called a service fee of Eight Thousand Dollars and agreed to pay 50% of every energy savings enjoyed for a period of sixty months, provided such savings could be made in Ontario. The default judgment was set aside as of right ex debito justitiae without terms imposed by the court. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff in the amount of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00). 1)There were triable issues between the parties and the defendant's apparent intention to avoid the jurisdiction of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, while simultaneously drawing the plaintiff into litigation in Ontario where it has no presence, was incapable of constituting a reasonable excuse, as contemplated by this court's interpretation of Civil Procedure Rule 12.06 in previous cases. 2)The defendant failed to establish any reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. This was not a mistake or an oversight. 3)Any irregularities which may have prompted the issuance of the Prothonotary's default judgment are not such as to cause me to find that the Order is nullity."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issue of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The issue of access was to be mutually agreed upon between the respondent and the child. HELD: 1) The petitioner was presently employed and the respondent was to pay child support (including the extra costs) of $948.00 per month. 2) The respondent is to pay one-half of the cost of extra-curricular activities as set forth on Exhibits P-9, P-10 and P-ll. 3) The court ordered $300 per month from the natural father of the petitioner to determine the difference between the third and fourth natural children of the marriage. The petitioner spent $400 per week of day care for Breeanna. She also paid $40 per month for play school. The total costs of $440 were to be paid by the respondent in their respective percentage based on the Guidelines. Given the fact that the petitioner's income is unlikely to increase in the near future, the court declined to order any spousal support. 4) There was no evidence as to the value of any of the farm implements. The respondent's land was valued at $176,000 less the sum of $15,580.00. The amount added back for Guideline purposes was $97,575.19.

The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.",The Government of Saskatchewan sought an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and in default of so doing striking the offending portions of the statement of claim.
