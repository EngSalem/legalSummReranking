"The respondent, a justice of the peace, issued a search warrant to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery. The applicants sought an order quashing the warrant on the grounds that the said search warrant was unlawfully and invalidly issued in excess of the jurisdiction of the Respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The sole ground upon which the Information was based was hearsay information from a confidential source and no details were provided in support of the informant's opinion or conclusion that such information is reliable. 2)The respondent acted within her jurisdiction in issuing the search warrant.",Warrant issued to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery. The affidavit in support referred to an unknown informant. Judge applied the test that the justice of the peace `must be satisfied on reasonable grounds.' Substantial compliance found and warrant upheld.
"An unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old girl applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal social assistance. Her application was refused because she was under 19 years of age and was living with and being supported by her mother and stepfather. The Appeal Board quashed the application for certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board which confirmed the denial of the appellant's application for municipal assistance as an expectant mother. Dismissing the appeal without costs, that the Appeal Board erred in interpreting the Halifax Social Services policy 1.2.5 as a discretionary right to assistance. The fact that an unmarried mother, pending the birth of her first child, could qualify for assistance even if she was completely maintaining herself without any family support, was not evidence that she qualified as a person in need under the policy. If the interpretation given to M.S.A. Policy 1.3.5 in particular was correct, the appellant did not qualify within the definition of 'expectant mother' as defined by the earlier provisions of s. 19(e) of the Act and was not the respondent's stepfather who was the head of family and maintaining the household in which she lived.","This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands."
"The first mortgagee to the project, the second mortgagee, had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction which he acknowledged required him to pay the mortgage brokerage and architectural fees from the previous mortgage advance from the mortgagees. The project was financially tight from the very beginning. Some of the suppliers and creditors had become dissatisfied with the handling of the project funds by one of the principals of and was withdrawing its support. In early April, 1987, the project manager, who was retained by the plaintiff to act as general counsel, requested that the funds be disbursed contrary to the letter of direction dated March 9, 1987 and an apparently unacknowledged letter of directions dated March 16, 1987 providing for the payment of mortgage proceeds upon the signature of certain individuals only. The plaintiff's claims were separately argued with regard to negligent misrepresentation and breach of trust. The subsequent issues of knowledge, reliance and causation render it appropriate to consider the various issues in the plaintiffs' claim together. Breach of Trust < 1]  1)The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $133,252.52 as against the defendant for disbursements of mortgage advances of $78,400.00. 2)The defendant was found to be a conscientious solicitor, always attempting to be in strict compliance with the terms of his retainer and endeavouring to avoid any apparent conflicts of interest and to follow the instructions of his clients, subject to any limitations which had been placed upon him through various irrevocables of direction. 3)There was no evidence that the defendant was ever in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs nor was he retained by them or purport in any way to act for them or on their behalf. 4)The plaintiffs did not establish the basis for a claim under breaches of trust and could not succeed on this ground. Any claim under this ground was therefore dismissed.","The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien."
"The accused applied for a review of the terms of his judicial interim release. He and his counsel consented to a judicial interim released order containing certain terms. The accused sought an amendment by adding the phrase'regarding Sgt. Brian Dueck or Carol Bunko-Ruys'. HELD: The application was denied. The picketing prohibition term imposed by the justice with the consent of the accused was reasonably constituted as a condition of his release from custody. But for this condition the justice might well have ordered the accused detained in custody on the ground that there was a substantial likelihood that the accused would commit a criminal offence if he were not prohibited from picketing prior to his trial. The amendment was also supported by the fact that if the accused wished to continue to picket and carry placards pending his trial, he would restrict his picketing to lawful activity.",FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel. The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place. He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.
"FIAT. The plaintiff, her mother and the defendants had destroyed their files 5 years after she attained majority before consulting counsel. The plaintiffs had not explained why she waited 5 years, except to say that she did not believe she could do anything as result of the original advice she and her mother received from the judge. The defendants had also destroyed the plaintiff's files. HELD: The application was dismissed and costs were to be paid to the trial judge. 1)The plaintiff's mother was injured in the accident. 2)The plaintiffs' decision to destroy their files did not recognize the contingent element involved in the situation of an infant plaintiff.",FIAT The Defendants were consulted by the Plaintiff and her mother 11 years earlier with respect to commencing an action for personal injuries arising out of a motor vehicle accident. The Plaintiff was only 12 at the time. No action was commenced with the result that the original action was now statute-barred. She waited 5 years after she attained the age of majority before taking this action against the Defendants. The Defendants applied to stay the action on the basis that they had never been retained. HELD: Application dismissed. Infants with bona fide causes are privileged suitors. An infant 'should not be visited with the sins of the next friends and litigation guardians who preceded him/her in the same action'.
"This was an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed by a Provincial Court judge for a break, enter and theft charge to which the respondent pled guilty. The respondent was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,500 or 50 days in default, plus a victim fine surcharge of $250 and three years probation. The Crown contended the sentence inadequately reflected the element of deterrence and that it was inadequate having regard to the nature of the offence and the circumstances of the respondent. The sentencing judge considered the correct principles of sentencing in this unique case.","The respondent pled guilty in provincial court to a charge of break, enter and theft for breaking into his neighbour's house and removing lingerie from a chest of drawers in the master bedroom.. He was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,500 or 50 days in default, plus a victim fine surcharge of $250 and three years probation. The terms of the probation order included a direction that the respondent pay restitution to the victims in the amount of $300, that he not have contact with the victims and that he continue treatment with his psychiatrist. The Crown appealed the sentence, alleging that it inadequately reflected the element of deterrence. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge considered the correct principles of sentencing . This was a unique case where it was apparent that the respondent did not commit the offence for the usual reasons and that he required psychiatric treatment."
"The plaintiff's radio station reported that a 12 year old girl had been sexually assaulted at a roller rink located close to Carpet World. The defendants claimed that the report was inaccurate and was not a proven reliable source of income. The plaintiff's employees at the station were often frustrated and did not want to be associated with the defendant company. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded costs of the action.  1)The court found that the defendants had published the information that it received from the police, an established reliable source. Nothing was to be found that suggested the sexual assault had occurred at the roller rink. 2)The Court awarded the plaintiff $12,500.00 as general damages and disbursements.  3)The plaintiff did not have a cause of action against the defendants and the action was dismissed with costs.","A radio station reported that a 12 year old girl was dragged and sexually assaulted behind a roller rink or between the rink and a store. The owner of the rink claimed financial compensation for a subsequent decline in his business which he alleged was a direct result of the broadcast. The script and reel had been destroyed and it was impossible to recreate exactly what was aired. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing that the defendant published was false, malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. 2)The station followed the CRTC Regulations and was exonerated entirely by its controlling body. The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source. 3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation. The business was on a down side at the time. The assault occurring where it did was not the fault of either party. If it had a bearing on the immediate attendance figure it was minimal and the plaintiff did no promotion whatsoever to increase attendance."
"The parties were married for seven years and had two children, one of which was in the joint custody of the parties. Upon separation, the appellant moved into the basement of their matrimonial home with the respondent. She claimed that she was suffering from lingering depression and that she entered into an improvident separation agreement to alleviate the effects of the drug Effexor. The respondent opposed the agreement, arguing that it was unconscionable and unduly harsh. Allowing the application to admit fresh evidence, that the appellant had not proven that she had a reasonable excuse for failing to challenge the separation agreement at the time of its execution, and that there was no evidence from the appellant's psychiatrist confirming her state of mind at the relevant time and the probable effect of the medication upon her ability to make rational decisions, nor having established that the proffered evidence could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial, was not an issue raised by counsel.","The parties executed a separation agreement that resolved all matters corollary to their divorce and the Matrimonial Property Act. The respondent husband proceeded with an uncontested divorce. The appellant wife did not oppose the proceeding. She subsequently appealed the corollary relief judgment on the grounds that the underlying separation agreement is unconscionable and unduly harsh. She sought to introduce fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that even with the new evidence, the appellant still failed to demonstrate an adequate excuse for not responding to the divorce proceeding. There was no evidence that the appellant did not understand her legal entitlement at the time the agreements were signed, or that she did not appreciate that a divorce proceeding had been commenced."
"The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.130 of the Land titles Act S.S. c. L-5 and s.56 of The Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act (EMOA) for an order relieving the respondent Estate (the deceased) from payment of a maintenance order by Johnson J.(as he then was) on November 28, 1972. The decree gave the deceased custody of their two children who were then 10 and and child support of $60 per month. The applicant contends she received welfare to support herself and the children until 1981. During these years she had no funds with which to hire a lawyer to enforce the support payments which were due to her. HELD: The application failed. The respondent was not mislead and has not been prejudice.  1)The applicant was nether the executrix named in the Will and received $40 per month in arrears of support. She presented no evidence of the transfer of the land to her, there was no consideration being paid nor was there evidence of what became of the income generated by the land prior to the deceased's death.  2)The respondent was entitled to recover the funds from the respondent and asserted her right to discharge of the order under s. 56 of the EMOA.  3)The question for resolution in whether it would in the words of the section be 'grossly unfair and inequitable' from the applicants perspective to refuse the application and whether such an order can be 'justified' in so far as the respondent is concerned was not relevant. Some of the evidence conflicts with the applicant's claim that she paid overdue mortgage installments to Farm Credit Corporation although she did not state the amount of the arrear.  4)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge.  5)Costs of this application were determine by the trial judge.",The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.130 of the Land Titles Act and s.56 of the Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act for an order relieving the estate from payment of maintenance ordered in 1972. The respondent objected to the application being brought on behalf of the estate as Olson was neither executrix nor a beneficiary under the Will. The Will had not been admitted to probate. The respondent had divorced testator in 1972 and was granted child support of $60 per month and monthly spousal support of $40. The applicant who cohabited with the deceased since 1978 transferred her home to him in 1980 as joint tenants and he transferred his two and one-half quarter sections of farm land to the applicant. The applicant suggested there was an agreement whereby the respondent lived rent free in the matrimonial home in lieu of support. The respondent received welfare to support herself and the children and had had no funds to pursue enforcement of the unpaid support payments. HELD: 1)The style of cause was amended to show Olson as applicant. She was an interested party within the meaning of s.56 of the EMOA and entitled to bring the application on her own behalf. The respondent was not misled and there was no prejudice. 2)The Land Titles Act was of no assistance to the applicant. The application was to be determined upon s.56 of the EMOA and whether it would be grossly unfair and inequitable to refuse the application. 3)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge. There was no evidence presented either of consideration being paid nor of what became of the income generated by the land prior to the deceased's death.  4)A trial of an issue was ordered to determine what if any portion of the arrears should remain a charge upon the lands. Some of the evidence conflicted. Viva voce evidence should be heard.
"This was an application for leave to appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court of Canada dismissing an appeal from the appellant's conviction under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown adduced breathalyzer readings of 110 and 120 milligrams. The expert was asked to relate the readings shown by the tests to the alcohol consumed by the appellant. He stated that the readings were not consistent with the evidence of consumption given by the accused. The trial judge concluded that the appellant had not raised a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the Crown is entitled to rely on the presumption of accuracy.","The appellant was convicted of failing a breathalyzer test. The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity. He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown."
"FIAT. The judge reserved his decision with respect to the hearing of the applicant's motion in conjunction with the proposed trial of the action. The issues raised in the application were complicated and not at all clear in their implications. The jury may be advised of the prior accident, the date of the accident, that proceedings were commenced in this Court and that the accidentultimately was settled, and the action discontinued. The applicant may introduce these records into evidence subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility and the costs of the application. HELD: The terms of the settlement should not be disclosed nor the sum paid to settle the claim. The release completed by her was part and parcel of the agreement. Beyond the issue of privilege, the more critical problem is revisiting the action which is a series of allegations made by the respondent against the prior defendant.","FIAT. At issue was what evidence of a prior action could be put before the jury. The trial was imminent. HELD: 1)The jury may be advised of the prior accident, its date, that proceedings were commenced in this Court and date of those proceedings and that the accident was ultimately settled and the action discontinued. The terms of the settlement and the sum paid were not to be disclosed. Beyond the issue of privilege which was a complete answer to the request, revisiting that action was a more critical problem. The sum paid to settle the first action was not allocated to any head of damages so those issues would have to be transversed as well. 2)The applicant may introduce his prior medical records with respect to the 1985 accident subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility. 3)The statement of claim in that action could not be entered at this trial as it was not evidence.  At best it was a series of allegations made against the prior defendant. The applicant could examine the respondent as to particulars of her claim in the earlier action and refer to material paragraphs. 4)The applicant was restricted to using the respondent's examination for discovery in the prior action for the purpose of cross-examination.  5)Costs were reserved to the trial judge. 6)The previous judge did not intend to reserve his decision with respect to the hearing of this motion and there was no impediment to the matter being reargued and disposed of."
"FIAT. The parties were married for over 25 years and were now senior citizens. The respondent sought an order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home. The court did not specify a date for the respondent to move from the matrononial home as it was hoped that satisfactory alternate arrangements could be made within reasonable time to avoid the potential of the respondent having to make an interim move to satisfy the time limit in a court order when his preferred accommodations might be available shortly thereafter. HELD: The respondent was granted exclusive possession. The matrimonial home was given to him. 1)The issue resolved around the interpretation of two conflicting rules regarding the execution of a judgment or an order of exclusive possession and the possession of matrimony. 2)Rule 15 was not activated nor was the service and filing of notice of appeal stayed. 3)All matters of this Court were directed to be prepared to re-examine the judgment and to make all applications to the Court of Appeal made pursuant to Rule 15 as amended. 4)The Court was also directed to make certain that all applications were directed strictly to the date the respondent had to move out of the home. 5)All applications should be directed to the court of appeal unless otherwise ordered. 6)The application of Rule 15 was never directed to a reapply nor was a notice of an appeal directed at the respondent. 7)The Rule 15 application was never to be re-directed nor was it directed to reapply unless the court had already decided otherwise. 8)All rules respecting the use of admissibility and correctness were to be adhered to. 9)The order for the exclusive possession was not stayed by the notice of appeals. 10)The provision that directions be given by the court in any event could not be interpreted to mean that all directions should be made in any circumstances other than the one made pursuant the judgment. 11)The matter was then scheduled to be heard in June 1998. In the meantime, notice of appealed was filed on behalf of Mike. On June 19, 1998, counsel for Mike took the position that with the filing the notice OF appeal, the court could still proceed to provide the requested directions. The issue resolves around the interpretive application of two subclauses (1) and (4) of Rule15 of the Courtof Appeal.",FIAT. Exclusive possesson and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner in May 1998. At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.
"The applicant requires leave of this Court under s. 7 of The Contributory Negligence Act, R.S.S.; c. C-31, and Rule 107A(c) of the Rules of Court. The proposed third party applies to join the First Nation as a third party to the action brought by the plaintiff against it and Starr; so that it can claim contribution or indemnity from it if the applicant is found liable to the plaintiff. The applicant alleges the applicant, the Attorney General of Canada, as the employer of Starr, was responsible for his conduct. The First Nation applies for join the G[…] First Nation so as to join it and be able to claim contribution and indemnity should the applicant be found liable. While pre-trial proceedings can be inordinate, the low threshold for prejudice has been met by allowing third party proceedings.","The plaintiff alleged he was sexually assaulted and that Attorney General of Canada as employer of the administrator of the residential school was also responsible. The defendant alleged the First Nation was responsible for the administrator's conduct and applied to join the First Nation as a third party so that contribution or indemnity could be claimed. The applicant required leave under s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act and Rule 107A(c) of the Rules of Court. HELD: Leave was granted to file a third party notice. 1)The low threshold for the establishment of a prima facie claim was met. 2)The delay would not be inordinate. The plaintiff's claim dated back to 1984. The parties were not ready for trial. No prejudice was established.  3)The third party's liability, if any, will have to be determined on a case by case basis. Each individual action brought by a former student at the residential school is different in nature. 4)The applicant was granted costs of the application against the plaintiff and the First Nation."
"The accused made an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under s. 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter had been infringed and sought remedy for that infringement. At the trial, Crown counsel called six witnesses to testify and during the course of the evidence of the sixth witness, requested that the Court enter a voir dire. The purpose of the voir net was to hear and determine an application by counsel for the accused for a finding that the rights of the accused under ss. 8 and 9 (a and b) had be infringed. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court held that the initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported 'un-arrest', and continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The accused's continued detention after the purported “de facto” arrest constituted a de facto arrest as described in Latimer.  1) The Court was not in error in that finding. The continued detention on his own initiative constituted a 'de facto' arrest. 2) There was no suggestion in the evidence before the accused that he misunderstood his actual status in any way, or that he was prejudiced by the unjust arrest. In the present case, the accused was not only put in direct contact with counsel but he had the opportunity to consult counsel and the warning. He gave a statement to the police.","The accused is charged with aggravated assault. A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter."
"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a highway in a manner that was dangerous to the public contrary to s.249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The accused voluntarily undertook to drive his vehicle and accelerate to this rate of speed on this stretch of road for a short period of time, in a marked departure from the standard expected for reasonably prudent drivers. The driving must be planned and deliberate. The mens rea is inferred from the driving conduct.",The accused was charged with dangerous driving. The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light. The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.
"The union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1) and to bring an appeal from orders made in 1999 and 1999 that the Union had been joined as an intervener or as an amicus curiae by virtue of Rule 8.02. The Union opposed all of the applications advanced. It argued that the notice of appeal was an attempt by the Union to reach a conclusion that the labor dispute between the respondent and the union was a 'labor-management dispute' within the meaning of s. 44 of the Judicature Act and that the trial judge erred in permitting the Union's proposed application to proceed. The union also argued that there was an arguable issue that the matter put before the Supreme Court in the initial Ex-Parte Interim Application and placed again on the return date of September 30/1999. The Supreme Court had refused to grant the Union the status of intervener pursuant to Rule 62.35. The application to be joined by an interlocutor or as party to an application was dismissed as the Union did not have the status to file an appeal until it was first joined in either of these two capacities. HELD: The leave granted to the union to continue its application was denied. It was not joined by a party to the proceeding or by an intervenor by Rule 8 nor was it joined as a friend of the court in any capacity other than that of a party or as intervener by order of the Court in any of the cases before it. 1)The Court held that it had jurisdiction to hear an application by a non-party to be added to proceeding as defendant, or as Intended Defendant under Rule 5.03. 2)It was convenient to deal with these applications by first considering the union's request to be join as an individual intervener, pursuant to Rules 7.04(1), 3) and 4.04. It is the Rule that should govern the consideration of applications for intervention to this Court by a single judge. 3)The Union's application should only be heard by an application to the Court of Appeal pursuant to rules 3.03, 37.05, and 62.31. 4)There are additional cogent reasons that influence the decision to refuse the relief requested. 5)There have been no reported decisions in this jurisdiction dealing with an application for intervention by non-parties to proceed as defendants. The cases arising under this section are usually concerned","The respondent filed an interlocutory notice, ex parte application, against the intended defendants, seeking an interim injunction. The applicant union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Rule 62.35, or as amicus currie pursuant to Rule 8.02, or alternatively as an intervener pursuant to Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1), and to bring an appeal from orders made by a Supreme Court judge in proceedings brought by the intended plaintiff against the intended defendants. Rejecting the applications, that a Court of Appeal judge sitting in chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status or to join a person as a party to a proceeding. Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal."
"The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000 to which his four daughters were entitled. The plaintiff had four children: Mabel, Brenda, Amanda, Jonathon and Jonathon. Mabel had told her that the money in the bank account was to be held for payment of debts of Mabel's estate, with the balance to be divided between the plaintiff's four children. Mandy had requested that the plaintiff endorse three cheques in blank for the benefit of the four granddaughters. The defendant had then died before Royal Trust Company had completed the instructions by transferring the funds to the credit of the annuity contract of Daisy McIntyre. The incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust and not merely to make a transfer. The purpose of the incomplete voluntary gift was not to convert the $25,000 in the account into an equity in favour of the plaintiff, but rather to create an equity for her benefit. The intended gift was to divide the debts of the deceased's estate and be given to the four grandchildren.","Plaintiff, as litigation guardian for his four daughters, alleged that the defendant, in breach of a trust, wrongfully retained $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled. Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs."
"An appeal from a Provincial Court decision on a Small Claim. The question of whether something affixed to realty is a fixture that passes with title to the realty. The respondents (third parties at trial)acquired title to house property and caused to be affixed bolted by use of anchor bolts in concrete slab poured for that purpose wheelchair lift loaned to the Jabours by the Abilities Council for use of their disabled foster child. The title was transferred to both the plaintiff and the third party. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the Realty notwithstanding how it was affixed thereto. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of that realty and the intention was a prime factor in determining whether something that is affixed is a feature in a realty such as that of the parties. 2)Although it was not a finding of the trial judge that the manner of attaching the wheelchair lift, i.e. only to the concrete slab, arguably showed an intention that it showed an interest that it needed to protect by notice on the title, or risk losing it, at least as against Tania and Kapronczai who had knowledge of the facts according to the judge. 3)In the circumstances, the appeal was dismissed both as it affects the plaintiff/third party and the fourth party.","An appeal from Provincial Court on a Small Claim. The Jabours, the third parties who acquired title to the house, firmly bolted a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Abilities Council by anchor bolts in a concrete slab. The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift. San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land. It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty. The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs giving a claim for damages. The Provincial Court judge dismissed the claim against the third party, the Jabours, on the facts."
"The respondent had pled guilty to 12 counts under the Income Tax Act failing to remit to the Receiver General, money deducted and withheld from salaries, wages or other remuneration paid to the employees of Halifax Regional Protection Services Limited (HMPS). The Crown sought an order of compliance pursuant to the provisions of s. 238(1) of the Income tax Act, ordering him to make payment of the sum of $22,069.23 to the receiver. HELD: A subsection 238(2) compliance order falls within the definition of 'any fine, penalty, restitution order similar in nature to a fine or restitution order imposed by a Court in respect of an offence...' as set out in s. 178(1)(a) and the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. Such matters were unaffected by the order of discharge under that Act. The Crown did not contest the Defence submission that the accountant and investor were officers, directors or shareholders in HMPS. It was not established that either of these individuals held in HRS any information about their financial circumstances or the prospect of recovery from them.","The defendant plead guilty for failing to comply with s. 153(1) of the Income Tax Act for failing to remit to the Receiver General of Canada money deducted and withheld from salaries, wages, or other remuneration paid to its employees. A fine was imposed pursuant to s. 238(1) of the Act. The defendant had filed for bankruptcy and argued that under s.168.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, he is discharged from all debts except matters referred to in subsection 178(1) of that Act.S. 238(1) of the Income Tax Act, falls within the definition of any fines, penalties, and restitution order as set out in s. 178(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.  The Court's jurisdiction to make an order pursuant to s. 238(1) of the Income Tax Act is unaffected by a bankruptcy proceeding."
"The defendant was charged with three counts of fraud contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code relating to his activities as president and principal shareholder of a bankrupt corporation. The defendant brought motions (the Charter Motions) seeking a stay of those charges on the basis his rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated by the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy and the RCMP during investigations of his activities and of the administration of the bankrupt corporation, and by the R.C.M.P. during his tenure as Superintendent. After the Subpoena was quashed, the defendant presented additional testimony from RCMP officers and evidence from a senior officer who was senior official in the Halifax Police Office during Mr. Redling's tenure. Mr. Black now suggests that the evidence which those witnesses gave and the documents to which they referred raise issues which warrant compelling the defendant's attendance. Application is dismissed; the defendant has not met the onus which rests upon him to satisfy the Court on the balance of probabilities that he has relevant or material evidence to give concerning the issues raised by the charter motions. The testimony and documentation presented at the hearings do not provide any basis to compel his attendance. There is no basis to find that the defendant is likely to provide any additional information concerning that issue.","The accused, charged with fraud, brought a motion to stay the proceedings on the basis that his Charter rights had been violated by the RCMP and the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. The accused asked the court to reconsider its decision to quash a subpoena issued to the former Superintendent of Bankruptcy on the basis of testimony presented from other witnesses after the subpoena was quashed. Application dismissed; the accused had not met the onus on the balance of probabilities of establishing that the former Superintendent had relevant or material evidence to offer concerning the issues raised by the Charter motions. The subsequent testimony and documentation did not support the accused's allegations concerning the former Superintendent's motives or conduct."
"Counsel had been unable to agree on costs after a four day trial. The plaintiffs were successful in recovering the base amount claimed but did not succeed in their claims for aggravated and punitive damages. The defendant proposed to fix costs in the amount of $15,000 plus disbursements. Costs should be substantially increased above the usual party and party costs because, as he contended, the defendant ought to have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. Costs awarded on the amount involved under Tariff A. Considering that the trial extended over 4 days and that a good deal of preparation would have been involved, this is not an unreasonable amount for the defendant to charge to his clients. The court found no fault on the part of the defendant in its conduct of the proceeding.","Following a four day trial, the plaintiffs were successful in the recovery of the sum of $29,150 against the defendant. Under the usual tariff, costs would be fixed at $4,725. The plaintiffs sought substantially increased costs on the basis that the defendant should have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. Solicitor and client fees totaled over $21,000. Costs fixed at $10,000 plus disbursements; there was no obligation on the defendant to admit liability but considering the amount of legal fees incurred in relation to the amount recovered, it was appropriate to go outside the tariffs."
"The parties, who were married in 1993 and separated in May 2005, applied to vary the existing child support order to one that provided that the parties would share joint custody of the children, with the respondent to have access every second weekend. The children's school and after school care had been changed to Bridgewater, one hour from Halifax, and their primary residence was in the Halifax municipality. The respondent determined that it was in their best interests to remain in the respondent's care beyond the end of the school year. Pursuant to the interim order, the children's extracurricular activities had been suspended during two weeks of block holiday time and the respondent was to designate for the children to be with him during that time. Changes in circumstances in this case warrant a review of the existing interim order. The parties have made significant changes in the past few months. It is not in the childrens' best interests, now, to be in the primary care of the father.","The court had previously ordered interim joint custody of the child, with the primary residence being with the mother. The mother later unilaterally moved from Bridgewater to Halifax, frustrating the access provisions of the interim order. The father applied for interim custody and the mother replied, seeking sole custody. Children to remain with the mother until the end of the school year, at which point primary care of the children will be granted to the applicant; child support adjusted accordingly. The mother's decision to move was not in the children's best interests and it was done either to frustrate or with a callous indifference to the children's relationship with their father."
"The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused was on duty in a marked police car when he was struck by the vehicle. As he was driving through a parking lot, the accused stopped his vehicle and backed up to assist another officer on a 'non-priority' matter. The second part of the test was whether the Crown had proved that the accused drove careless. The officer's evidence showed that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance (less than one foot) and not at a fast or accelerating speed. The Court was satisfied that the officer exercised due diligence applying an objective test in assessing carelessness and whether the accused has then shown, on a balance of probabilities, that he exercised Due diligence in the context of the circumstances he encountered. The actions of the accused which could be considered careless are, firstly, the speed at which he drove past the stopped vehicle, and secondly, his driving forward into the officer's vehicle.","The accused is charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence."
"The accused was charged with being at large on her undertakings given to Justice or Judge and being bound to comply with conditions including that she abstain from all use, consumption and possession of alcohol and that she was not impaired by alcohol at the time she made the demand. The accused testified that she knew the alcohol would kick in and she wasn't really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of all counts. The certificate of analysis was not admissible because the breathalyzer demand was not made forthwith or as soon as practicable. The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the demand and there was no subjective belief on the part of the officer that the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by Alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s.8 and 9 Charter Rights of the accused, it should be excluded under s.24(2). Its admission would render the trial process unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on part of a officer that she has been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effect of the alcohol at that time. The Court found that the evidence was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot alone prove impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused is charged with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and impaired driving contrary to s. s. 253(b) and 255(1) of the Code. HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving."
"The appellant appeals his conviction of dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the Crown was consistent with Fleury's guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The appeal is allowed, and the conviction is set aside. The appellant argues that, without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove that it was not possible for Fleury to have swerved in such a manner to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.","The appellant appeals his conviction of dangerous driving. The police did not see the appellant driving; they came across his minivan immersed in a slough in excess of 35 feet off the highway. Based on the tire tracks, the appellant was charged with dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described. HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. While no accident reconstructionist was available to check the accident scene after the incident, the Crown could have called an expert to testify whether the defence's theory could hypothetically be rational. However, no expert was called. The appeal is allowed and the conviction set aside."
"The accuseds were found guilty after trial of committing two offences contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code, and with intent to commit an indictable offence, having their faces masked. The accuseds had been in custody since January 31, 2007 and were serving time on remand at the time of their appeal. The Court of Appeal increased the sentence to two years less a day for the date of appeal, taking into account their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued within the city, and the need to deter not only these individuals but also anyone else who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","The two accused were found guilty, after trial, of robbery with violence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code and wearing a mask with the intent to commit an indictable offence contrary to s. 351(2) of the Code. HELD: The accused are sentenced to 40 months imprisonment for the offence of robbery with violence and 4 months consecutive for the offence of having their faces masked. Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months. The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery."
"The claimant claimed damages for a house sale because the sellers did not disclose that the place had flooded in the past. The claimant alleged there was damage to the chimney base, which was under repair and the heavy rain would cause seepage in the furnace room. This was a minor problem and the sellers had not disclosed it to the public. The plaintiff alleged there had been repeated repeated breaches of contract and that the claimants had been induced to purchase the property by negligent misrepresentation. The defendant motion for non-suit was granted. At trial, the judge made a decision not to grant the motion, finding that the claimant did not make out her claim as evidence of the necessary elements to prove the claims were not present. The court reviewed the law on a motion for a nonsuit and found that it was necessary to allow the parties to present all the facts that can be proven in a court of law. The doctrine of caveat emptor was used to determine the sufficiency of the evidence and the test for a successful motion for such a motion was not based on the weight or believability of evidence but rather on the fact that the claims had been advanced over the years and that there was no evidence to support the claim.","The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding.  Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem."
"The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing the death of his passenger and causing bodily harm to the driver. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in sentencing him to five years imprisonment because his prior convictions were not relevant and his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge allowed the appellant to be cross-examined on all of his criminal record even though some of the prior convictions (such as driving over.08 and failing to stop at the scene of an accident) and he was given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. 2)It is clear that the existence of an alcohol related record was raised by the appellant's own counsel and that the extent to which he had an alcohol problem was put in issue. However, the Crown did not object to the questions and the court was not satisfied that they had any effect on the trial. 3)The appellant raised a number of complaints in relation to his cross-examination. He raised questions about previous criminal convictions by the Crown, the evidence of his previous alcohol related offences and the issue of whether he was the driver of the truck at the time of the collision. The defence sought to exclude portions of his record on the basis that their admission was more prejudicial than probative. 4)The Court was unable to conclude that the appellant was prejudiced by the questions.","The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case."
"HELD: The Court found that the defendant was not guilty of the charge under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981. The Court also found that all of the uncontroverted facts in the evidence were consistent with an inescapable inference that the accused was using the searchlight for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The defendant was found not guilty on all of these matters. On all of them, the Court was convinced that the searchlights were used for the purpose of hunting.","Mr. Kenny is charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with use of a searchlight when hunting. Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2) For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The case was decided on the basis of credibility. The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused. The Court stated that, on all the evidence, it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged."
"The parties had both requested an order to seal the contents of their divorce file. They had done so after receiving a request from the media to examine that file. The media request was made according to the provisions of Civil Procedure Rule 59.60. Both parties sought exclusion of the public on the date of the hearing and a publication ban. They recognized that some of the documents in the file may be disclosed if they are entered as evidence during the hearing or referenced in the decision of this court. Allowing the application and sealing the file, that the public has an interest in and expects personal identifier information contained in court documents to be protected in order to prevent identity theft. This is a public interest important to the public and important to society. The salutary effects of a sealing order do outweigh its deleterious effects because the public interest in an open court is not completely circumscribed by this order.","Rule 85.04 – Order for confidentiality The parties moved under Rule 59.60 to have the court seal their file after media asked to view it. They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.  , the file will be sealed. While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does. The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies. A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs. Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough. Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents). Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered. The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation."
"This was an appeal from a decision wherein the trial judge declared a mistrial and set a new date for trial because the Crown had not disclosed a police record that contained the individual weighing of each set of wheels on the accused tandem axle truck. The appellant argued that a declaration of mistrial on a summary conviction charge was an order under s. 813(a)(i) of the Criminal Code, from which the accused can Appeal. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial Judge erred in setting a new trial date, and in failing to find that the appellant's rights had been violated under S. 11(d) and Charter of Rights and Freedoms as a result of non-disclosure.","The appellant appealed a decision of the trial judge declaring a mistrial in his summary offence trial and setting a new date for trial because the Crown had not disclosed a police record.  He argued the judge erred by not ordering a stay of proceedings and/or a dismissal at the beginning of the trial, and by failing to find the non-disclosure violated his rights under s. 11(d) of the Charter. He sought a stay of proceedings in this action. Dismissing the appeal, that a declaration is not an 'order' under s. 813(a)(i) of the Code in that it does not bring a final end to the matter. It is therefore not appealable."
"The appellant appealed the order of Diehl, P.C.J. pursuant to the provisions of s.37(2) of The Child and Family Services Act permanently committing his three children to the care of the Minister responsible for theadministration of the Act. The names and birth dates of the children were recorded as follows: D.W.M. born November 26, 1980; D.A.M., born July 6, 1985; M.A., who was born July 8, 1985, and M.B.M.. who was the foster parent. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. It was an established principle that an appeal court should not interfere with the findings of fact by a trial judge unless the findings are not supported by the evidence or the conclusions reached by the trial judge are clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable. The trial judge did not misdirecthimself on the law or the evidence with respect to the GOverning principles as set out in Saskatchewan (Minister of Social Services) v. E.S.IG; SaskSCC v. R.G.; Saskatchewan (minister of social services), (1993) 108 SaskR. 107; Saskatchewan (MINISTER of Social services) v.(1990) 1990 CanLII 7428 or on the application thereof to the evidence before him.",A Father appealed an order permanently committing his 3 children to the care of the Minister of Social Services. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)It is an established principle that an appeal court should not interfere with the findings of fact by a trial judge unless the findings are not supported by the evidence or the conclusions reached by the trial judge are clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable. 2)The trial judge did not misdirect himself on the law or the evidence with respect to the governing principles applicable to applications of this kind.
FIAT. The applicant applied for an order varying the support provisions of a 1989 judgment. He sought an order requiring a total payment of $570.75 per month for the two children of the marriage. The respondent wife opposed the application and sought an extension of the order. HELD: An order for a trial of the issue. 1)The respondent wife was to have custody of the children. 2)The petitioner husband was to pay the respondent for her support and for the support of the two infant children. 3)The applicant alleged there were agreements to amend the original order as contemplated by the order and that he had complied fully with the original orders and with all amendments thereto. He denied there were any arrears.  4)Costs including travel were reviewed and the appropriate level of maintenance was determined.,"FIAT The Husband alleged that a child support order, originally in the amount of $1,200.00, had been reduced by mutual agreement to $500.00 per month in 1989 when the Wife commenced employment. He applied to vary the order to correspond to the alleged agreement. The Wife denied any agreement to reduce the original order and sought judgment for arrears in the amount of $55,000.00. HELD: On a review of all material filed, the Court concluded that it was not possible to resolve the matter summarily. The Court directed a trial of the issues between the parties."
"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for the child. The child was apprehended at birth and is currently the subject of a child protection hearing. The applicant takes the position that it is not the appropriate party to act as a litigation guardian on behalf of H.B. However that does not fully determine the issue. Pursuant to its statutory authority and to its inherent parens patriae jurisdiction, the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of the child; she requires independent representation to ensure that her rights are protected. HELD: An order was issued pursuant to s. 32 of The Child and Family Services Act and an order was ordered to issue accordingly unless the public trustee, within 10 days from the date of this order, showed cause as to why it was not the proper party to so act. There was no order as to costs.  1)The Minister was right in asserting that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under mentaldisability in cases other than where a property interest is involved. 2)S. 32 is considered in the context of the entire Act. It is intended to authorize the public trustee to protect and administer the property of infants and dependant adults. Nowhere does the Act authorize the PTA toact as a personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. 3)The Public Trustees best fits the criteria enunciated by Wright J. in Szwydky v. Magiera.","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. who was alleged to be of unsound mind. H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing. The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected. If the court failed to intervene H.B. will be left in limbo, a victim of the system."
"In an action for unpaid monies, Turf Masters obtained a subcontract to perform most of the work on a recreational park and sports field for the City of Dartmouth. The consultants for the city had been aware of the material non-disclosure reports made by the city and CBCL, which had been incorporated into the original action. Shortly after commencing the work, the City found that there were significant subsurface problems with the site which made the work more difficult and costly. The plaintiff commenced an action against both the City and the CBCL in quantum meruit pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 14.25 on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. The defendant applied to strike out the plaintiff's statement of claim and dismiss the action. Dismissing the application, that to allow the defendant to now basically relitigate the same action on the same factual basis on a different legal concept would be an abuse of the process. In all the circumstances of this case, the 'wait and see' attitude of the defendant was not justified.","The plaintiff was subcontracted by the City of Dartmouth to build a sports field. The defendant were the project consultants for the City, and were involved throughout the tendering process and construction. Their report indicated a number of significant potential problems. The plaintiff was not made aware of the report when it bid on the project. The plaintiff subsequently became aware of the problems, which made their work more costly. After completing the work, it commenced a claim for the additional work which had to be performed due to the undisclosed site conditions. The defendants were joined by the City as a third party to that action. The plaintiff was successful at trial, but the decision was overturned on appeal. The plaintiff then commenced the present action directly against the defendant, alleging negligent misrepresentation. The defendant applied to strike the action on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. Granting the application, that the present cause of action is the same one litigated in the first action, simply under a different legal concept. To allow the plaintiff to relitigate the same action on the same factual basis would be an abuse of process."
"The court appealed an order which varied a child maintenance order. The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into about a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The court found no reversible error in the judge's decisions, supported by written reasons, that the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s. 9 of the Guidelines; the appellant's income, for the purposes of the guideline, should include the bonuses he received from his employer in 1996 and 1997 and the fact that he did not currently have a business based in the home; and that the judge erred in requiring the appellant to pay a portion of the $230 per month the appellant was ordered to pay in respect of extraordinary expenses for extracurricular activities with the meaning of s. 7(1)(f)of the Guidelines.",An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.
"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over the legal limit contrary to ss.255(b) and ss.253(a). At trial, only one witness was called. The Crown called a peace officer who was on duty in uniform and driving a marked police vehicle. The officer observed the vehicle displayed an out of date sticker on it's license plate in violation of ss.27(5) and 26 of the Highway Traffic Act. The police officer engaged the vehicle for approximately 2 minutes before engaging in a search for open liquor. At the end of the search, the officer asked the accused if he could act because he was within the jurisdiction of the city police. The accused blew 170 and 160 respectively on the breathalyser tests. HELD: 1)The police officer was not responsible for policing when there was an agreement between the province and the federal government. It would not be appropriate for the legislature to limit the opportunity for policing of community by making sure fewer police officers are able to act in any particular setting within the province. The Police Act must be read in a context as providing a manner of funding policing not as taking away jurisdiction granted to R.C.M.P. officers by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act. 2)There was no good public policy reason for the police officer to be excluded from operating in any specific geographic area. 3)The stopping of the vehicle was a routine check conducted to ensure that the accused's papers were in order and he had valid driver's licence. 4)The officers were authorized to search the vehicle and conducted their duties within the meaning of s. 27(5). The police Act requires that all police officers must perform their duties in the lawful execution of their duties. In this case the officer was acting within his jurisdiction and had jurisdiction to make the demand. 5)The Court concluded that the stopping was a random stop and that the Crown's intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country was clear, broad and unambiguous. The words 'are assigned' refer to the three distinct objects and not to specific areas of jurisdiction. The purpose of the words “are assigned” to refer to something specific, rather than a particular geographic area, was not to determine what the law was and what the scope of his duties and responsibilities were. 6)Costs in the amount of $10,000 were awarded to the","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1). The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles. The R. v. Emke decision is outdated. 3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty. There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter."
"The petitioner seeks an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. The parties married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in December 26, 1997. Each has significant assets at the time of the marriage which have increased in value since that date. They agreed in their wills that after their deaths their entire estates would be left to their respective children. They each completed new wills shortly after the marriage to this effect. HELD: 1) The petitioner is entitled to judgment for half of the value of the assets acquired after marriage being: one-half of the Value of the Melville residence owned prior to the marriage $42,000.00; One-half each of the furniture, vehicle and camper are held in trust pending the outcome of this proceeding.  2) There is no 'extraordinary circumstance' as provided in s. 22(1) of the Act which would prevent the values of the family home from being divided equally between the parties. 3) This is an appropriate situation to apply s. 40 of The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, c. F-6.3 which provides as follows: 40 The court may, in any proceeding pursuant to this Act, may conclude that a verbal agreement made at the marriage that each would maintain their own assets separately and not make claim on the assets of the other leads to a reasonable consideration of the present value of each spouse's assets. In this case the petitioner is not entitled to any such consideration.","The wife sought an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. They married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in 1997. Each had significant assets at the time of the marriage, which had increased in value. They agreed at the time of the marriage to keep their assets separate and to not make a claim on the assets of the other and that their entire estates would be left to their respective children.  The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths. HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000. 1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention. This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home. The Melville residence owned by the wife at the time of the marriage was exempt in accordance with their agreement. It had not increased in value and the wife solely paid its maintenance. 3)No costs."
"The applicant vendor applied for an order pursuant to the Vendors and Purchasers Act for an ordered declaring that the objection raised by the defendant is without merit. The applicant entered into an agreement with the purchaser that allowed the closing of the transaction on November 14, 2002. The agreement provided for the closing date on November 15, 2002 and that the application was not made during the pendency of the contract. The purchaser agreed to extend the closing Date to November 15. The application was dismissed. The closing date will not automatically extended by reason of the application.","The vendor's application for an order declaring that the purchaser's objection was without merit was commenced 13 days after the closing date.

"A tenant appealed the rental home's Rentalsman's decision. The tenant had claimed damages for rent loss, cleaning costs, damages to the premises and utilities which were not paid. At the appeal hearing, the tenant took the position that the notice he received of the cleaning claim as set out on the hearing notice was inadequate and, when he attended for the hearing before the Rentalsmansman he was not prepared to refute the amount of the clean claim. Further, he argued he could not ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The Rentalsmann's decision was patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the facts. He reached a decision based on all the evidence and came to a conclusion that was not unreasonable given that evidence. 2)The appeal of Mr. Maley was not denied natural justice and due process in this matter.","FIAT. After the tenant vacated the home, the landlord, pursuant to Residential Tenancies Act s.47, sought $3,746.76 for rent loss, cleaning, damage to the premises and unpaid utilities. The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01. The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence. The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting. The Rentalsman's decision, made after reviewing pictures, repair bills and the statements of house cleaners, who indicated the hours worked and their hourly rate, was not patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the evidence."
"The applicant company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by it to its creditor (the 'W.R.T. Proposal'), pursuant to Part III of Division I of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The proposed amended para. 9.1 of the Proposal was consistent with the provisions of ss. 50(13) and ss.50(13). The applicant opposed the court's approval of the applicant's proposal on the basis that members of the employee pension plan who have been classified unsecured creditors (by virtue of the Company's indebtedness for the unfunded portion of their pension plans) should beclassified in some other category of creditor. The Trustee made an application to the Registrar in Bankrupty for court approval. Notice of Objection to this application was filed on behalf of a former 28-year employee of the company, which was bound by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement applicable to certain of its production employees including Mr. Tilk. At the December meeting of creditors, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims and 1 opposed the proposal. HELD: The proposal was granted and the draft order filed by the Trustee was issue. The court ordered that the amendments be consistent with ss. 48(13)(a) and (b) of the BIA. Taking into account all of the interests the court concluded that the proposal presented by the trustee did meet the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the court. Absent the application of the provisions in the provisions under the Bia to an employer it is clear that an employer's indebtednesses to an employee pension plans does give the pensioners preferred creditor status by virtue of s. 43(3) of The Pension Benefits Act, 1992. With the intervention of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and proceedings under that Act, including the presentation of a Proposal, the court was satisfied that the proposed legislation did not have the same legal status as the applicant proposal. The applicant company and its employees found themselves in the same position.","The company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by its creditor pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide. He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status. HELD: The Proposal was accepted.  1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA. The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation. Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.  3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing."
"The appellant wife appeals the decision of the chambers judge varying the amount of child support and reducing the arrears in the absence of evidence that there was a change in the conditions, means and needs of the respondent or the children as contemplated by s. 17(4) of the Divorce Act. The chambers judge erred in varying the order for maintenance and reduction of arrear in absence of an evidence that he has failed to satisfactorily explain his unemployment or reduced employment over the last four years. There is evidence that his change in income is due to his own voluntary action and, as a result, he failed to establish the threshold 'change in circumstances' which could result in a variation of the order. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the decision by the Chambers judge is set aside. The child support is varied to $510 per month in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines. The respondent is to pay the sum of $200 per month. There was evidence from which the Court could impute income to the respondent in the amounts of $27,000, and the child support shall be varied to the $510.00 per month as of February 1, 2004. The amount of $1,926.78 currently held by the Maintenance Enforcement Office shall be applied to the Arrears. The sum of money of $960.78 held by Maintenance Enforcement Offers to the Respondent. The Respondent shall pay $200.","Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] The appellant wife appeals the decision of the chambers judge varying the amount of child support and reducing the amount of arrears. She contends that the chambers judge erred in varying the order for maintenance and reducing the amount of arrears in the absence of evidence that there was a change in the conditions, means and needs of the respondent or the children as contemplated by s. 17(4) of the Divorce Act.[FOOTNOTE 1][2] The respondent contends that the amount of child support should be reduced by reason of his reduced income caused by his unemployment or reduced employment over the last four years. The appellant argues that the respondent has failed to satisfactorily explain his unemployment. There is evidence that his change in income is due to his own voluntary action and, as a result, he has failed to establish the threshold 'change in circumstances' which could result in a variation of the order.

There is evidence from which this Court can impute income to the respondent in the amount of $27,000, and the child support shall be varied to $510.00 per month as of February 1, 2004 in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines.

"FIAT. The respondent applied to vary the support and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 judgment. The 1995 judgment provided for the divorce of the petitioner and distribution of matrimonial property estate to the couple as well as custody, access and support for the child of the marriage. At issue was whether there should be a variation of the custody order. HELD: The respondent's application was dismissed. The court found that the respondent had not shown a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The fact that the petitioner was 15 years old at the time of the 1995 judgment did not disqualify him from the application for variation. There was also no evidence that he bore the onus to prove there was a change in circumstance sufficient to warrant variation in child support. The petitioner was, as of August 2003, 10 months in arrears of child support and ordered to reapply for variation in the order of custody. Child Support and Arrears: 1)The respondent had been in the custody of his mother for the past six years. His principal residence was with her and was closely located to her collegiate and circle of friends. It was clear that his best interests required that the status quo be continued. 2)The petitioner was not a candidate for joint custody and shared parenting. Both parents were in fact candidates to be the custodians of the child. 3)The mere passage of time in this instance would constitute material change of circumstance relevant to the custody application. The 35 year old petitioner should not be made to feel obligated to spend more time with her parents. Nor should the natural growth of the 15-year old child toward independence be misconstrued as sign of disaffection. 4)The applicant was awarded the costs of the application.","FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs."
"The accused, who had previously entered guilty pleas to eight counts contained in an indictment, now plead guilty to three counts of breaking and entering. The charge of being a party to unlawfully causing bodily harm was originally a charge of aggravated assault but the accused pleaded guilty to one count of break and enter. The accused had a Grade X education and had a sporadic employment over his adult years at his employment as a labourer. HELD: The appropriate sentence is a term of four years and six months in a federal institution, followed by a period of six years incarceration. The aggravating circumstances of the break and enters and the fact that the accused was driving a vehicle that went off the road and upset the vehicle did not help matters. A further reduction of one and one-half years would be justified.","The 23 year old defendant pled guilty to two counts of breaking and entering a dwelling house and one count of breaking and entering a shed. He cooperated with the police and provided evidence against his co-accused. He had a previous criminal record, which included convictions for mischief, theft, break and enter, breach of an undertaking and possession of stolen goods. Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment; in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused."
"The accused was charged with robbery. The defence applied to exclude the letter on the basis that it was obtained by an unreasonable search or seizure and thereby violated the accused's right under s.8 of the Charter of Rights. HELD: The accused was found guilty of robbery. 1)The letter was not an alibi. It was an honest admission by the accused that he was not at the Eureka Club at the time of the robbery. 2)The accused's failure to identify the accused at the preliminary, preliminary and trial (eight months after the robbery) was a reason to suspect or reject his evidence that he identified the accused in the photo ID line-up three and one-half months later. 3)The defence had no reasonable doubt that the motorcyclist on the second occasion, the person reported to the police at the station and the person identified by the picture in the gallery were the same person the accused. 4)The adverse inference was drawn against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate alibi by perjury. 5)There was no other explanation in evidence for the request for the false evidence to be given.","The accused is on trial for armed robbery and the central issue is identity. The Court admitted a letter into evidence in which the accused attempts to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi for him. HELD: Accused found guilty. The accused was correctly identified. The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by. The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry. The letter is direct evidence of where the accused was not at the time of the robbery and is corroboration for the identification evidence of the Crown witness."
The proposed appellants applied to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal of a Queen's Bench trial judge order awarding costs to the respondent jointly and personally. They propose to appeal on the basis the award was punitive and inordinately high. Counsel for the proposed respondent advised the court the appellant had orally refused to grant the extension for the reason saw little chance of success on appeal. The parties have not taken out the order and thus have maintained jurisdiction to decide the matter. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs on double column V. The court was still of the view the appellants would have little chance on appeal given that costs are a discretionary award and there was material on file upon which the trial judge could base his decision.,The proposed appellants applied to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal of an order awarding costs payable jointly and personally by Tapp and Spelliscy on the basis the award was punitive and inordinately high. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Court is still of the view the proposed appellants would have little chance of success on appeal. Costs are a discretionary award and there was material on file upon which the trial judge could base his decision. The appellants failed to first apply to the trial judge to obtain leave to appeal as required by Queen's Bench Act s.38.
"The appellant appealed an order in Queen's Bench granting him child support. He now moves for an order under Rule 15 staying execution and garnishment proceedings with respect to para. 2 and para. 4 of the above order. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The appellant's income is found to be $83,611. He should pay child support by mail. He appears to take the position that personal service was required. Whether the appellant was validly served under the Queen'sBench Rules is an issue that will have to be properly presented and determined by the division of the Court hearing the appeal.",The appellant sought an order under Rule 15 staying execution and garnishment proceedings with respect to an order granted in January 2003 for child support and s.7 expenses and costs. He questioned the validity of service by mail arguing personal service was required. HELD: Whether the appellant was validly served is an issue that will properly presented to and determined by the Court hearing the appeal. Bringing an application under Queen's Bench Rule 271 would have been a more expeditious procedure. The stay was granted since this was the type of appeal that can be expedited. The monies paid into court will remain in Court pending the hearing and determination of the appeal. Costs were reserved to the Court hearing the appeal.
"The applicant applies by originating a motion for a declaration that the respondents are obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against them and others by Genex Swine Group Inc. (the 'underlying action'). The applicant specifies that each of the respondents issued comprehensive general liability policies in favour of the applicant. The respondents take the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend (and to pay defence costs) for the claims brought against Westridge and others in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The applicant's legal allegations are properly pleaded. 2) The onus of establishing that the terms of the policy obligate the insurer to defend rests with the applicant, who is not bound by the legal labels chosen by the plaintiff. The mere fact that Genex alleges both negligence and a breach of contract is of no moment sufficient to change the insurer's duty to defend.  3) The liability for compensatory damages is limited to 'bodily injury or property damage' which occurs during the policy period. 4) Occurrence 'Occurrence' includes continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which result in loss neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the Insured. 5) The insurer must look beyond the choice of labels and examine the substance of the allegations contained in the pleadings. This does not involve deciding whether the claims have any merit; all court must do is decide based on the true nature of the claims.","The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant. The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident. What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence. Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend."
"This was an application for an order for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment under Rule 31.01. The plaintiff was making a significant claim yet when one listened to defendant's counsel and read the material attached to his lawyer's affidavit, one found there were significant other factors affecting the plaintiff's health. Judgement was entered against the defendant as to liability for the accident and against the plaintiff as to the amount of damages to be assessed. The defendant argued there should be an 'air of realty' to the plaintiffs argument that she had not been able to establish that the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries. The court granted the appeal and set aside the order of the trial judge. It is not the function of the court in determining the matter of an interim payments to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them. A summary judgment is not to be allowed when there is an arguable issue to be tried, namely, that even if one accepts the defendant's evidence, one has to consider the issue of contributory negligence.","The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial."
"The parties, who were married in November 1980 and began living separate and apart in August 1993, entered into an oral agreement in which the father was to pay $6,000 per month. The mother was to take responsibility for the children's education and spousal and child support payments. The father terminated the payments in August 2005, claiming that he had no difficulty continuing to pay the costs of their children's post-secondary pursuits. The wife, who was working at the time of the agreement, alleged that she had no financial contribution by the father to the children in the father's care. She alleged that the father paid $2,000 directly to her, $1,000 to the mother, and $5,000 in post-dated cheques to the father. She claimed she received $52,000 from the father directly, and that she owed $69,500 in matrimonial debt and any other debt in his name. The parties entered into a standard variation clause in the Separation Agreement in 2005 and the agreement was terminated in 2006 with the amount of the arrears to be paid to the respondent reduced to $2 per month (the father paid directly), and $2 million to the Respondent in the amounts of $12,500 per year (the mother was responsible for the rest). The father continued to pay support, unabated and without termination, while paying all expenses related to the school and health care expenses, and garnishee was in place until the date of the hearing in January 2006. Wife's income was reduced by approximately $50,000 due to the two older children leaving the mother's care and moving in with their father or being supported by their father, and she claimed to have lost her savings, pre-separation RRSP's, and equity in the home. She did not have any pension or savings, post-marriage RRSP, or equity in her bank account, nor any retirement plans or savings or pension entitlement. She relied on the terms of the original agreement and had no real motivation or motivation to pursue employment or retraining to assist in her own support. She fell behind in her income tax payments and received $10,000 after the mother had taken action with Maintenance Enforcement. She claims she owed them $29,500 and that they have not had any difficulty dealing with her father directly to obtain support. Husband ordered to pay half of the outstanding child and Spousal support payments of $32,500. The respondent ordered the payment of $2k,000","The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself."
"The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA). The order prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares of Alliance Green Traders pending a final decision on the merits of the plaintiff's claims against the defendant in Turkey, and the conclusion of this action. The defendants sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order, requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to ss. 5(7) of the EMJA, and $40,000 security for costs. Application to amend the order was denied. The court reviewed the case law and adopted the test proposed in Duke v. Vervaeck, 2013 SKQB 439 (CanLII), 138 Sask 277. In this case, the defendants applied pursuant to Rules 3-72 and 3-84 of the Queen's Bench Rules for an order that the plaintiff be added as a plaintiff, and that the defendant be amended as a defendant and to amend its statement of claim. The purpose of that application was to determine whether either of the defendants would suffer actual prejudice as a result of the proposed amendments. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)The court exercised its discretion to order the plaintiff added as plaintiff and amendment of the statement of Claim in the manner proposed. It is not open to the court to terminate a preservation order granted by consent pursuant to S. 20(a) and (b) of The Limitations Act. The legislature could not have made its intent clearer more clear. 2)There was a sufficient temporal and factual relationship between the occurrences on which the original claim was based and those on which it was based. The plaintiff chose to await the outcome of the Turkish Proceedings before taking any further steps. It was not reasonable to infer that the defendants intended to resolve the issues through litigation. 3)The Court was not satisfied that the plaintiffs had failed to prosecute this action without delay. The application to add the plaintiff was denied in part. The amendment was granted in part and portions of the amended Statement of Claim were added. 4)The amendments were not necessary to create a wholly new proceeding. 5)The two conditions specified in s. 20 are met. 1)Absent a delay of more than a year the preservation orders will be terminated. The preservation order will remain in effect until the Turkish Court has rendered its final decision. The Court was satisfied the delay in obtaining a final judgment was caused by the passage of time.  5)","Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8 The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim. ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24."
"The plaintiff was found two-thirds responsible for the injuries suffered when the defendant's vehicle struck her while she was attempting to cross the No. Highway. Damage to the plaintiff's vehicle was assessed at $1,255.25. The defendant agreed to apportion costs in the same percentage as the findings of fault. The only offer to settle was withdrawn less than a month later. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to double her costs and fixed the amount involved at $50,000. The plaintiff was also entitled to interest for a period of 3.5 to 5 years. Counsel for the defendant were advised that they had been unable to agree on any issues concerning interest and costs. The Court awarded the plaintiff half of its taxed costs on the counterclaim. The amount of interest to be awarded was reduced by 25% as the defendant submits the award to be one-half of the actual recovery should be limited to the amount of the plaintiffs actual recovery.","The plaintiff was found to be two-thirds and the defendant one-third responsible for an accident which occurred when the defendant's car hit the plaintiff as she tried to cross the highway on her bicycle. The court awarded costs to the plaintiff fixed at the amount involved - the quantum of general damages. The parties were unable to reach an amount of settlement. In this matter, the defendant argued that the costs should be fixed at the amount actually recovered by the plaintiff. Awarding the plaintiff one-third of her taxed costs, that to reduce costs by the percentage of fault of the plaintiff and to reduce the amount involved would be a double reduction."
"FIAT: The accused applied for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing a count of the indictment as amended on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction; an order under ss. 7 and 24(1), the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictments as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment of Klebuc J. in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer, and an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay. The Crown argued that the application to quash was substantively different from that determined by Matheson J. who had earlier in the year requested that the Crown provide particulars. HELD: The application to dismiss the count was dismissed. 1) The Crown was not bound by the findings of the trial judge in Schafer. The Court was not in any way bound by any of the findings in the original indictment. 2) In some cases the Crown conceded that it would be beneficial to both the accused and the Crown to have the benefit of the benefit in the light of the new indictment. 3) The Court dismissed the application by the accused that it was not interested in proceeding with the trial which would result in a reduction in the indictment from the number of counts it already faced. The applicant's argument that the conclusions of the judge in the Schafer case were not substantively similar to that determined in the earlier indictment was not supported by the Crown's argument. 4) The applicant was granted an order to remain in the province until the outcome of the Schaper trial was known.","FIAT. The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay. There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges."
"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act, 1997. The accused was stopped by a police officer as he was proceeding through a rural area when he noticed a tractor trailer travelling in an easterly direction. The officer noted that the trailer was overweight and there were three sets of axles on the unit- steering axle, drive axles and tridem axles. No overweigt permits had been issued to the accused and so the officer issued a ticket to the driver. The Provincial Court did not issue a finding that the accused violated s38. The defence argued that the document referred to was not proof of the Minister’s order according to law, even if the document was proof, the order was a regulation under the provisions of The Interpretation Act and so its provisions applied to it. HELD: The accused’ s licence to operate a motor car was set aside and a copy of the order issued by the Minister was given to the nearest municipal division in which the grid roads were located. The provincial municipality did not have copies of the original order nor could it be shown that the original was published. Even if it could be said that the steps taken by the municipality were sufficient to satisfy the requirement of a copy, the court could not conclude that the offence was committed. The evidence did not establish that the Minister issued the order for the purpose of this case.  1)The Provincial Court concluded that notice of an order issued under the provincial Crown to entities situated along highway #1 that were involved in the transport of goods was the most appropriate manner. The municipality did however take appropriate steps to cause notice to be given. The issuing municipal council directed notice of the minister’S order to the municipal division clerk and entities situated around highway #2 that were in the transportation of goods. 2)The municipality did, however, place road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on highway #332 as well as other signs describing an alternative truck route. There was no publication in any local newspaper or provincial daily.","The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA)."
"The paternal grandmother applied in Chambers for an order that she be added as a party so that she can appeal a permanent care order respecting her granddaughter. The child was the subject of protection proceedings brought by the Children's Aid Society in the Family Division. The paternal grandmother did not participate in those proceedings. She now argued that a judge in Chambers does not have the authority to make the order sought. Application dismissed; the Family Court has jurisdiction to deal with the application and the matter is decided by a Chambers judge. The Chambers judge will only have jurisdiction to make an order if it is the right judge. In the circumstances, that judge would not make the ordered as, in the opinion, an application to the Family division for leave to terminate the permanent care orders appears likely to be a more appropriate initial way for the applicant to proceed.","The applicant grandparent applied to the Court of Appeal to be made a party to the proceeding so that she could appeal a permanent care order made in respect of her granddaughter. Application dismissed; a judge of the Court of Appeal in Chambers does not have the authority to make the order requested; in any event, an application in the Family Division for leave to terminate the permanent care order would be a more appropriate way for the applicant to proceed."
"FIAT. The issue was whether there had been a material change in circumstances by virtue of a change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, or financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support. The husband's position was summarized in his affidavit as follows: $3,000 per month spousals support will be varied to $5,500 per month, continuing on the first day of each month thereafter until further order. The wife will have costs in the amount of $1,000. HELD: An increase was warranted, but not to the extent claimed by the wife. Spousal Support was varied to a $1 million monthly increase and will be increased to $3k per month in the wife's favour. 1)The only material change was the fact the wife was residing with a new partner. Their arrangement essentially allows him to reside in her home at no cost in exchange for his performing yard work and housework. The very duties her new partner was to perform are for sale on the company's behalf. He is employed, but his income is not stated. He makes no apparent financial contribution to the household. The benefits inherent in a shared living arrangement are not adequately or reasonably accounted for by the average wife. The fact that she is residing with this new partner does not material change. An increase is warranted but not necessary to reach the maximum amount requested.","FIAT. The issue in this application to vary spousal support was whether there had been a material change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support since their 1999 interspousal contract. The wife requested a 50% increase based on the husband's income increase of 50%. She suffered from MS and was unable to work. HELD: Spousal support was varied to $3,500 monthly. The only material change in the wife's means and needs is that fact she is residing with a new partner who resides in her home in exchange for yard work and housework. Although he worked, he made no apparent financial contribution to the household. The wife was awarded costs fixed at $1,000."
"This was an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the respondent was subordinate to that of the R.M. even though the mortgage was registered before the mortgage of the respondent. The appeal argued that the trial judge was inconsistent with the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and the application of s.54 of that Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to the respondent and one-half of the cost to the appellant. 1)The respondent had agreed with the appellant that its mortgage would be subject to the prior security interest of the applicant. It was not intended, as between itself and the respondent, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to thatof the respondent 2)The trial judge held that the respondent's interest was an unregistered interest but that by virtue of the filing of its caveat the respondent obtained priority over the appellant's.  2)In this case the respondent had chosen to foreclose its two registered mortgages against the subject land. The trial judge concluded that the second FCC Mortgage had priority over its mortgage of a similar nature. 3)The Court of Appeal disagreed on the following analysis. It would have to conclude on the basis of the above authorities that the first FCC Mortgage was of a general rule, overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to covenant to postpone.","This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act."
"The accused was charged with impaired operation, driving over.08 and breach of his s. 7 rights. The voir dire was held following a voir net on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer. The accused made self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of his belief that he was reporting the accident. HELD: The accused's statements were excluded from the trial on the basis that they were made in violation of the accused's s.7 rights. There was nothing in the statements that amounted to a violation of his right to make a statement. The defence argued that since the statements were made after the arrest and were based upon evidence that was obtained by a breach of an accused's section 7 rights and was self- incriminating, the admission of those statements would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions of the officer. 1) The arrest was illegal and exclude all evidence obtained thereafter, or at least that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police cannot rely on that information to make the demand. 2) The defence abandoned its previous investigation and accompanied the accused by remaining with him while the officer waited for the Blood Kit to arrive and for the blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the accused was also awaiting treatment for his injuries. 3) The officer concluded that the accused had a legal obligation to report the accident promptly and if he believed he was Reporting the accident, he should ask the accused for a blood sample to determine the quantity of alcohol in his blood. However, the self- incriminating statement made by him that were made under compulsion of statute have been excluded. Does is it not follow that any evidence that came about as a consequence of the the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the (i)s. 7 right? 4) The accused responded to the officer interrogating him about the accident and he interrogated him about it and the accused provided additional information to him. The evidence must only be excluded based upon the factors expressed in R. v. Collins, [1987] SCC), 113 C.C.C.(3d) 321 and Stillman (1997). 5) The Crown conceded that the Crown had a legitimate obligation to make self--incrimination statements and the statements made were made as part of that obligation. The officer was not acting with serious, intentional disregard of his accused's rights nor was he taking a position to challenge his rights under the Traffic Safety Act","Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights."
"The claim was reduced from the amount of its judgment to fall within the monetary limits established by the Small Claims Court Act and in the alternative, enforcement of the debt as contract. The defendant commenced an action for breach of contract against the respondent in the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench. The Respondent did not file a defence and consequently the defendant obtained default judgment for an amount not cited in either parties' submissions. The claim proceeded by way of argument. The adjudicator found that s. 9 of the Act did not provide the Court with authority to enforce an Order arising from foreign jurisdiction. He further determined that, although the Court had jurisdiction to proceed with the claim for a breach of the agreement under contract, it was prohibited as there was no evidence 'that the Alberta action was withdrawn, abandoned, struck out or transferred' pursuant to s. 15 of the act. Rather than determine a claim based on a fixed amount, it is apparent an Adjudicator, in a case of this nature, would be called upon first to settle a dispute regarding the original Court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract, and a factual dispute concerning attornment. Taking into account the purpose of the legislation, the remedial goals, the underlying values of efficiency and access to justice, and the potential for a complex and lengthy fact finding process in this action, the present claim extends beyond the authority of the Alberta court.","The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract. The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment."
"HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the applicant’s two bills fell within the period of time allowable for an assessment by the registrar and that it was in the interests of justice to abridge the time allowing for the assessment. As the bill was not a final bill, and since the privilege was held by the applicant and only waived when he filed his affidavit on February 26, 2008 (as he attached the bill), the court was not satisfied that the bill fell within that time. The time being abridged was relatively short. The client took exception to the bill and requested an assessment. The defendant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue or hire alternate counsel but did not do so. The applicant was directed to forthwith pay the assessment costs.","Applicant seeks an order for an assessment of his legal bill. A Registrar may assess any bill for legal services, provided that the application is filed within 30 days or more if a judge makes a discretionary order to extend the period for assessment if it is in the interests of justice to do so. The issue if whether the applicant's two bills fall with the said 30 days or if this is a case where it is appropriate to abridge the time for allowing an assessment. HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment. The bills were issued in two separate matters. In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue. There will be no extension of time for the first bill. The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it. He was advised that the bill would be adjusted. An initial adjustment was made and when still not satisfied, ongoing discussions about the bill continued. The Court held that the last document received by the applicant was not the final bill as it was still subject to change. In this case, the lawyer has been paid from monies held in trust for the client, the time being abridged is relatively short and neither party has alleged that any prejudice would result."
"The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, of driving with a blood alcohol content of over.08 on the following grounds: 1) The trial judge erred in law in finding there was no breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The appellant contends that the trial judge failed to consider that other cars had previously made a tight turn as evidenced by other tire tracks in the soft snow. The officer noted the smell of alcohol emanating from her breath once she extinguished her cigarette. She then leaned against the police vehicle. 2) On the whole of the evidence, there was sufficient evidence, when viewed objectively, to support the officer's contention that the appellant was impaired by alcohol. The standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is very high. 3) In attributing four and half years' experience to the officer when in fact the officer had only three years' practice at the time of the offence, did not constitute a material error. The appeal court must assess the reasonableness of the decision, namely that there was not a breach of s. 8 Canadian Charter rights, especially in respect to the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. 4) The appellant's position that she did not require assistance for her to exit the vehicle and walk to the police cruiser was not supported by the evidence.  5) The officer's failure to specifically mention that she could walk and enter a police vehicle without assistance does not establish that he failed to take that position. The evidence as found by the officer was based on a palpable and overriding (or manifest) error.  6) The standard of review is correctness and the test of deference must be correct. 7) The court dismissed ground one of the appeal on the basis that the officer erred by failing to consider whether there was a material or overriding error. 8) The evidence was found to be consistent with the appellant's reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a breath sample. 9) The errors of fact were not proven. 10) The failure to provide the appellant with a breathalyzer resulted in a breach pursuant to s. 9(b). 10) In addition, the appellant challenged the objective basis for the officer to make the breath demand which was that other vehicle tracks in soft snow had a similar position and velocity. The officers were not required to refrain from eliciting any incriminating evidence until the detainee had been given the opportunity to consult with legal counsel.","Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message."
"The applicant seeks a Voices of the Children (here a Voice of the Child as V. is the only person in issue) report to ascertain V.'s wishes and gain clarity on his best interests. HELD: A formal judgment was issued in 2012 and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. In the absence of an order varying the shared parenting order, she seeks a 'voice of the child report' be prepared in order to ascertain the respondent's best interests and gain a clarity of V.'s best interests by having the report prepared. Pursuant to court order, this matter arises following a trial in 2012 wherein Justice Kraus found that shared parenting regarding V.M., born March 8, 2005, should occur on a one week rotation basis (2012 SKQB 130 (CanLII), 395 Sask R 165). Formal issuance of the order slipped through the cracks and thus no judgment was ever taken out. The application now brought by the self-represented plaintiff is to have formal judgment issued and vary that decision in favor of her being the primary residence and that a 'voiced of child' report be prepared for the purposes of this application.  1) The affidavit evidence filed by the mother and father make it clear that Julie's views are not being reliably communicated to the court. 2) An independent assessment of her wishes with respect to her mother's proposed move back to Assiniboia and there a resumption of shared parenting arrangement will assist the court in deciding the custody and access plan that is in the best interests of V. 3) The affidavits are conflicting in nature and it is appropriate to ascertain that the appropriate order at this time is the commissioning of the Voice of Child report. If so, it ought to then be undertaken prior to ruling on the variation application. The variation is dependent on the report. 4) The parents are significantly strapped financially and as such declined to make an order for the costs of the report to them. It is to be borne through resources provided to the program aside from the parents.","Family Law – Custody and Access – VariationFamily Law – Custody and Access – Voices of the Children Report In 2012, after a trial, it was determined that the child should be parented on a shared basis with a one-week rotation between parents. An order was never issued and therefore, no judgment was taken out. The applicant now applied to have a formal judgment issued, and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report. The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time. The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour. The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure. She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy. HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report. It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report. There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time. The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old. He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court. The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program. The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report. The application was adjourned sine die returnable not sooner than 14 days after the report was received by all parties. The judgment was directed to be issued."
"The plaintiff and defendant were involved in a lawsuit regarding the sale of three quarters of land in the Rural Municipality of Hazel Dell. Both parties agreed that the requirement of writing under the Statute of Frauds was an additional requirement to the usual essential elements of a valid contract. The plaintiff states that the offer was in writing via the exchange during the internet-based land auction and the acceptance was orally communicated via telephone. The defendant states that after the bidding process closed, the plaintiff agreed to sell the land to the highest bidder respecting the Unsold Quarter. The issue was whether the agreement was created and, regardless, even if an agreement existed, it was not in writing as required by the Statutes. HELD: 1) The plaintiff must prove on a balance of probabilities that a contract was created between the plaintiff and the defendant respecting the Subject Quarters and that the formalities of the Act have been satisfied. 2) By inquiring into the words used by the defendant and the context in which those words were used, the court is not opening the door to considering evidence of what was actually going on in these men's minds. What may have been meant by Mr. Ziola's question and Mr. Petrie's answer regarding the subject quarters and the offer respecting the Adjacent Quarters is irrelevant.  3) The defendant must prove that he and the plaintiff exchanged information about the offer and the content of the telephone conversations between them.  4) The court accepts that the defendant is truthful and credible. The court is unwilling to ascribe dishonesty, complacency or frailty to the relationship between the parties. The relationship was not created solely as a result of the defendant's repeated assurances that he would not accept the plaintiff's bid for the land but through his repeated assurances to the plaintiff that he had received better offers than the plaintiff had. It is only through these assurances that the court will be able to conclude that the parties were in agreement that the Court can conclude that a contractual relationship was created.  5) The parties must establish that the plaintiff is entitled to rely upon the evidence of his or her testimony. The Court accepts that both parties were truthful, credible witnesses and that their testimony and the manner in which they expressed their opinion was sufficient to warrant an award of damages.","Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract."
"This was an appeal of a Family Court decision which set aside a custody trial and remitted the matter for a new trial. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to new trial, that there was a real likelihood of bias in the trial judge's decisions regarding the natural father and the biological mother. To them, that amounted to a denial of natural justice by creating an apprehension of bias. All three counsels submitted that they had decided the case before they had heard all the evidence, and that they gave the appearance of a closed mind. Dismissing the appeal, that, in the absence of a real possibility of bias, and assuming that all the trial evidence was considered, and given the judge's decision, which was not overturned on appeal, and considering the evidence of the natural mother, there was no real likelihood that bias would result, nor was there a danger to the public peace.","During a hearing involving an application for custody contested by three parties, the trial judge heard only the appellants' evidence and the direct examination of the natural mother before calling counsel to his chambers and advising them that the hearing was a waste of time and custody should be granted to the natural mother. Counsel for the appellants subsequently put the matter on record and requested the trial judge withdraw, alleging an apprehension of bias. He refused, and after completing the trial, awarded custody to the natural mother and her common-law companion. The decision was appealed. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the decision and ordering a new trial, that the circumstances created a reasonable apprehension of bias which resulted in a denial of natural justice. In the conduct and carriage of civil actions the law requires a fair and impartial hearing."
"This was an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court in Chambers granting an application under s.21(4) of the Nova Scotia Evidence Act ordering inspection of banking records to the appellant but imposing two limitations. The appellant appealed the decision of this Court which allowed the wife's appeal in part holding that the judge erred in ruling inadmissible certain evidence about the value of scallop licenses. This Court remitted the matter to the Supreme for determination on evidence to be adduced by the parties of the value inter alia of the fishing licenses and boats of the respondent. The respondent has since gone into bankruptcy. He contends the examination ordered by the Chambers judge is nothing but a duplication of the detailed and searching examinations that will be made of his assets by the trustee in the bankruptcy proceedings. The appeal is allowed and the two restrictions placed in the order of the Chambers Judge respecting the books or records relating to Fundy Associates Limited or the motor vessel ""Lady Marion II"" are deleted. The applicant shall recover her costs of this appeal.","The parties divorced - the appellant later appealed the trial decision dividing property between them as separated spouses. Her appeal was allowed in part, the court holding the judge erred in ruling inadmissible certain evidence about the value of scallop licences. The matter was remitted to Supreme Court for determination on evidence to be adduced by the parties of the value of the respondent's fishing operation. In preparation, the appellant applied to the Supreme Court for an order to inspect the respondent's bank records pursuant to s. 21(1) of the Evidence Act. The respondent argued he had limited involvement in the enterprise being discovered. The judge granted the order with limitations: the examination was to be limited to income received by the respondent and covering the period from the trial date forward. The appellant appealed, arguing the limitations disallowed full disclosure. In the interim, the respondent went into bankruptcy and argued the examination would be fully conducted by the trustee. Allowing the appeal, that a possible duplication was no reason to limit full disclosure."
"The bankrupt obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry and an Advanced Certificate in Science-Physio as a result of student loan funding. He was indebted to Canada Student Loans in the amount of $22,338.99 and Saskatchewan student loans in the amounts of $18,241.39. The Saskatchewan program objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt. HELD: After carefully considering the submissions and bearing in mind the objects and principles of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, an absolute order of discharge is appropriate.  1)An absolute order was appropriate. 2)The bankrupt was just shy of his 30th birthday. He is living at home and working and living at the home and is paying very reasonable rent and food expenses. He has been unable to make small payment toward his obligations. The trustee, on the other hand, recommended an absolute discharge.",The applicant sought an order requesting an absolute order of discharge in bankruptcy. The bankrupt was indebted to Canada Student Loans and Saskatchewan Student Loans. He had obtained a Bachelor of Science degree but was unable to complete his final year of Veterinary Medicine because he had received the maximum amount of financing available. The bankrupt had been employed for 5 years as a taxi driver earning a less than average income; he lived at home with his parents; he was single with no dependents. He was reluctant to leave secure employment in an effort to obtain employment related to his educational qualifications. Counsel for the objecting creditor argued that the bankrupt had a minimal income and had the capacity to make small payments toward his obligation. HELD: An absolute order of discharge was granted in accordance with the principles of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.
"FIAT. The applicant motion materials filed by the respondent were deficient and ought to include a copy of the notices of intention with proper proofs of service and a specific deposition as to whether the land in question is or has been 'homestead'. The Farm Land Security Board ought to complete it mandatory tasks under Section 12 under the Act and provide its report in the format described in s. 12(4),(5) and(7) of the Act. The apparent refusal by the applicant to provide information should not be allowed to derail the process of financial review as information is available from other sources to deal with the matters in Section 12 (12)(a) and (b). The Board may apply incentives to the respondent to participate by following the procedures in the s.12(4) and 7(8) portions of the legislation.

HELD: Application adjourned and leave is given to each party to file further materials. The Farm Land Security Board is requested to provide its report to the Court. Ordinarily, the deficiency in the applicant's motion might merit dismissal, but the Act would then give the respondent a 1 year grace period.

"This was an appeal from a decision of the Deputy Rentalsman ordering the landlord to pay the sum of $3,414 to the respondent. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The correct definition of an agent of the landlord is that of a representative for a landlord. The fact that the appellant received notice that he was named as a party in the hearing notice clearly indicated he was now a named party. There was no merit to the suggestion that he did not receive notice of a hearing where an award could be made against him. Furthermore, there was nothing to indicate he was unable to prepare and present a defence on his own behalf.","An appeal from a decision of the Deputy Rentalsman ordering the landlord to pay $3,414.50 to the tenant.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The material clearly showed the appellant received notice that he was named as a party and in fact was the only party named as landlord. An itemized list of the damages claimed was attached to the notice. There was nothing to indicate he was unable to prepare and present a defence. 2)There was no error of law. The definition contained in s.2(d)(ii) was considered in Lachance v. Auzano Asset which held s.2(d)(ii) was determinative of the issue.

"HELD: The applicant seeks an order of declaration that the charges against him cannot be categorized as professional misconduct without contravening provisions of The Licensed Practical Nurses Act, s. 24 of The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code and an order to prohibit the discipline committee from hearing the charges. He seeks a writ of prohibition from proceeding with the hearing of the charges on the grounds that whatever occurred while he was picketing Planned Parenthood amounts to professional misconduct within the meaning of the Act.  1) The applicant is a member of the Association and is charged with professional misconduct contrary to s.24 of The SASKATCHEWAN ASSOCIATION OF LICENSED PRACTICAL NURSES. 2) The application is dismissed with costs to the applicant. 3) The matters in question in this case are res judicata. The applicant submits that the matters in the only matter previously considered by a discipline committee of the discipline panel of the SALPN dealt with whether there was any professional misconduct established arising out of criminal convictions for illegal picketing prior to him becoming member of SALPN. Re: 3. Should the discipline Committee be prohibited from proceeding With the Hearing of the Charges? 4) There is an application by the SAPLN to the Court of Appeal pursuant to s24 of the Saskatchewan Human rights Code. 5) There are factors that must be considered in making the determination of whether or not an alternative remedy is adequate. The procedure on appeal, the composition of the senate committee, its powers and the manner in which they were exercised were probably to be exercised by a body which was not a professional court of appeal and was not bound to act exactly as one nor likely to do so. Other relevant factors include the burden of a previous finding, expeditiousness and costs. 6) The facts are alleged to support the conclusion that the applicant is guilty of professional misconduct.","The applicant sought a declaration that the charges against her could not constitute professional misconduct without contravening the Charter and Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; an order of prohibition to prevent the SAPLN discipline committee or Association from hearing the charges; a declaration that the charges are res judicata; an order for particulars; costs.

"FIAT: The applicant brings an application for a court order requiring the solicitor to withdraw as solicitor for the applicant. The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged that Mr. Therrien alleged that confidential information was shared. The applicant submits that it would be a conflict of interest for the lawyer, who took part in the collaborative law process, to continue to represent the applicant as her lawyer, as the issues between the parties have not been settled. HELD: The application is granted. The court ordered the withdrawal of the solicitor as counsel. It is agreed that the only way to resolve the conflicts would be by holding a viva voce hearing. On that basis, the parties may proceed to pre-trial and a trial if necessary on the issues agreed to. As Mr. Miller has agreed to act as counsel for Ms. Ponder, it is set for April 2006.",FIAT: The respondent brings an application for a court order requiring Reginald Sauer to withdraw as solicitor for the petitioner. The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged by the respondent that confidential information was shared. The respondent also relies on the provisions of the collaborative law agreement signed by the parties. HELD: 1) The conflict in the facts was apparent and was not resolved by additional evidence. 2) Mr. Sauer agreed to withdraw as counsel so the parties may proceed to pre-trial and a trial without the necessity of a viva voce hearing.
"At issue was the ownership of monies in a joint bank account in the names of the deceased and the estate of her late mother. Over $50,000 was held on deposit in the account by the appellant and the respondents. The probate court judge found that the account was opened in 1989 and a bank employee explained the right of survivorship to her and her mother. The signature card signed by the late Mrs. Scott and the respondent at that time was not produced before the court. All parties were self-represented on the appeal. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the probate judge did not find that any of the witnesses lacked credibility; the evidence was such that he did not have contradictory testimony before him. His decision which dealt with joint bank accounts and the presumption of resulting trusts follows the principles set out in Pecore v. Pecores. Each case is very fact specific and it is incorrect to find, as was done here, that if there is a joint account, it is automatically gift to the survivor. In many cases, after the death of a parent the funds were determined by the court to belong to the estate. In some cases, however, that is not the case here. Allowing the appeal and remitting the issue of the joint account ownership to the court for determination, that the judge focused on assessing the evidence available to the Court and applying the appropriate legal principles. The same standard applies to questions of mixed law and fact, unless question of law is readily extricable when the standard will be that of correctness.","At the time of the deceased's death, she held a bank account jointly with her daughter. Although the signature card signed when the account was opened could not be found for the hearing, the probate court relied on the evidence of the bank representative (who testified that she had the card when she closed the account and she was 100% sure that the account was a joint account and who was able to present to the court the form of the applicable account agreement) in determining that the monies in the joint account belonged to the daughter.  It was also found, on a strong balance of probabilities, that the deceased intended to make an inter vivos gift to her daughter and, alternatively, that the evidence rebutted any presumption of resulting trust in favour of the deceased or her estate. Another of the deceased's children appealed. Appeal dismissed; the probate court judge did not misapprehend the evidence, lack an evidentiary basis for his findings, rely upon incorrect legal principles or fail to apply or misapply the law."
"The plaintiff and her partner were in an apartment building when they jumped from the top floor of a building. The building was essentially a wooden structure with vinyl siding on exterior walls and asphalt roof shingles. The ceiling had been completely burned out and there were no sound of fire alarms. The plaintiff suffered serious injuries from the fall. The fire alarm system in the building was not functioning at the time of the fire and the plaintiff's had not received advance warning of the existence of smoke or fire for several days. The smoke alarm system was not working prior to the fire which was known to the defendant's supervisor; the defendant did not maintain, test, inspect or inspect its fire engine system that was in excess of 25 years old; there were problems with the smoke detector and its fire alarm systems; the self-closing hallway doors were continually in an open position and the plaintiffs were not advised as to whether the door was locked or closed. Although there was no evidence the defendant was responsible for the fire, it created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire as the fire spread quickly and the smoke detectors did not operate properly.","The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building. The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income. Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue. When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs. The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries."
The plaintiff applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendant from entering into any lease with the plaintiff and permitting the operation of a bingo hall by the defendant except as a tenant. The defendant had refused to renew the lease and the plaintiff had sought an injunction restraining its use of the premises by the plaintiff. The plaintiff contended that the defendant had a strong prima facie case and that it was unable to rely on the failure to give written notice as required in the lease. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the applicant had failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the plaintiff will suffer from the refusal of the injunction greater than that which will be suffered if it is granted. On the basis of Mullin's affidavit the court dismissed the application for an interim injunction.,"An application for an interim injunction restraining the Regina Exhibition Association (REAL) from interfering with GCB's enjoyment of certain leasehold premises in the Jubilee Building and from entering into any lease with Regina Central Bingo (RCBA) and preventing the operation of a bingo hall by RCBA within Exhibition Park except as sub-tenant of GCB. The original five year lease for use of the Jubilee Building as a bingo hall between Fundraising td. and REAL was assigned to GCB with REAL's written consent. GCB further sublet the building without REAL's consent or knowledge. Written notice of renewal was not sent to REAL. The basis of GCB's application was estoppel on the basis that REAL entered negotiations regarding a relocation of the bingo hall and then began to deal directly with CGB's sub-tenant after the renewal date had passed. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)There was no evidence that Fundraisers, the original party to the lease, attempted to exercise the option to renew. 2)GCB did not have a strong prima facie case on the merits. It appeared that there were no negotiations between GCB and REAL. 3)There would not be irreparable harm. Under the current arrangements, the bingo would be operated by RCBA. If successful at trial the damages to GCB can be easily calculated based on the time it was unable to occupy the premises. 4)On balance GCB failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the inconvenience it will suffer by the refusal of the injunction will be greater than that suffered by REAL if granted."
"The respondent applied under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by the respondent and Humboldt priority over that of its security interests in two reefer trailers. HELD: The application was allowed. It was ordered that its purchase money security interests be priority over the security interests of the respondent in them.  1)The issue to be determined was what is meant by the term possession in s.34(2)(a) and when, in thecircumstances of this case, Lake Air obtained possession orconstructive possession of the trailers within the meaning of the priority section.  2)The respondent did not become debtor in possession until the terms of the lease were met and the security agreement was executed.  3)Although each of these cases were decided under the former Act, sections 22 and 34(2) are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the concept of constructive possession which is not directly addressed in the section. The term 'possession' in these sections is not necessarily equivalent to bare physical possession. In the circumstances of the case before me, to deny the respondent priority over Humboltt would provide the purchaser an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air. 4)The applicant was ordered to pay full value to the respondent.  5)The applications were allowed. The applicant is ordered to have its purchase and maintenance of the collateral by another person at the request of the debtor.  6)The purpose of the application was to determine when debtor's possession begins for the purpose of calculating the fifteen days within which the purchase money interest security must be perfected.  7)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.33(2(a) unless that person is a debtor as defined, unless the collateral is collateral as defined by s. 34(1) and unless another person 'obtained' physical possession as opposed to passive possession.  8)There was no dispute that the Associated lease agreements were for more than one year, that they pertain to collateral that does not consist of intangibles or inventory, and that the parties' lease agreements contained an acknowledgement by the parties that the respectivetrailer was delivered to them at the location and on the date set out in the lease.","Associates, which held purchase money security interests pursuant to its 1997 leases, applied under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by Associates and Humboldt Flour Mills in two reefer trailers. Humboldt's security interests were acquired pursuant to a security agreement granted in 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in 1998 to specifically include the trailers. It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly. To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air."
"The accused, who was charged with the murder of his former residents, applied for a stay of proceedings alleging that his rights under s.11(d) and 11(f) of the Charter had been infringed due to the pre-trial publicity generated by the case. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was no evidence before the Court on the merits of the case as the trial had yet to begin. 2)Judicial information had been contained in many of the media reports and there was a palpable sense of fear and terror surrounding the accused's trial such that it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial by an impartial jury.","The accused was charged with first degree murder. Prior to jury selection, he applied for a stay of proceedings, alleging that there had been a breach of his right to a fair trial due to negative pre-trial publicity. Dismissing the application, that the application was premature. However, the accused would be permitted to challenge potential jurors for cause due to the highly prejudicial and inflammatory pre-trial media reports."
"FIAT. The applicant mother applied to vary the terms of the child support order made against her in March 1999. The March 1st, 1999 order imputed annual income of $18,000 to the applicant and set ongoing support at $400 per month (consisting of regular support of $334 plus $66 for s. 7 medical and extraordinary expenses consisting primarily of hockey expenses) and Ms. McMillan born May 2, 1989. The parties both filed current information regarding s. expenses which were exorbitant. HELD: The application was allowed to proceed with a cancellation of arrears of $1,900, being one-half of the total of $3,800 in arrearars. 1)It was unlikely the applicant would earn $18000 during the year 2001. But on the basis of the material filed, she was capable of earning $15,000. The court must factor in as well, the ability of the applicant to pay a reasonable level of child support. The applicants clearly capable of paying more than $17 per month for her three children. 2)The basic child support for the three children under the Guidelines at $250.00 per month based on an imputed income of approximately $15000, and reduced s. 8 expenses to $50 per month.","FIAT. The mother applied to vary the terms of the 1999 child support order under which she was to pay $400 per month composed of $334 for regular support plus $66 for s.7 medical and extraordinary expenses for their three children based on an imputed annual income of $18,000. She sought to cancel arrears of $3,800 on the basis she will overpay if child support had been calculated in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines on the basis of her actual income for 1999 and 2000. She also sought to reduce child support to $17 per month based on a projected income of $7,000. HELD: 1)One-half of the arrears were cancelled. The mother must accept responsibility in part for allowing arrears to accumulate over the 2 years. 2)The mother was to pay $250 per month based on an imputed income of $15,000. She was capable of contributing more than $17 per month. Her share of s.7 expenses was reduced to $50 per month. Neither filed current information. 3)Costs would have been ordered if the mother had been more reasonable in her submission for variation."
"The father was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $454 per month. Since the issuance of the order, the father has been unemployed by reason of health problems and, as a result, arrears of child support are constantly accruing. HELD: In the event the father receives a settlement in his law suit against the Government of Canada based on his claim of abuse suffered at the Indian Residential School, the first $50,000 will be paid into Court with the exception of paying any legal fees and disbursements plus taxes owing to his solicitors. The settlement proceeds will be divided equally among the parties. 1)It is not offensive to direct that the respondent's counsel, at the time of settlement, if there is a settlement, pay monies into Court. Such an order does not impact the rights of the respondent but merely imposes a clerical task which is natural incident to the preservation of the asset in debate. 2)It was ordered in the case of the Indian residential school that in the event of a settlement the respondent be restrained from disposing of any money that he has received or may receive in relation to the lawsuit without a further Order of Court. Section 8 of The Family Maintenance Act only authorizes restraining orders against those against whom a claim may be made and therefore made under s. 8. The threshold to be met in such an application was simply that the disposition or wasting of an asset would impair or defeat a claim under the Act.","The father was unemployed by reason of health problems and was in arrears on the December 13, 2002 child support order for $454 per month. He was seeking damages against the federal government for alleged abuses suffered while attending an Indian Residential School. The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property. The mother was awarded costs of the application set at $350."
"The wife was a high school graduate and was employed as a cleaner. She claimed that she was depressed and unable to work, and that she required a special diet. She also claimed that her marijuana use had made her depressed. The parties lived together for eight years and had two children. The wife earned $7,936 per month (gross)during the marriage. She earned $8,255.00 (per annum) as a result of the marriage and had difficulty working outside the home. She required special diets and a specialized diet. The husband was a corporal in the Canadian Armed Forces and made four years of contributions prior to cohabitating with the wife. He withdrew the largest portion of the pension contributions and applied them to matrimonial debts. The matrimonial assets were divided equally and the wife was entitled to an equal share. The court held that pension credits earned before and during the marriage were subject to equal division, but for the operation of s.13 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the pension was divided equally. The petitioner's pension was not divided with his first spouse. Rather, he withdrew the significant portion of his RRSP and applied it to matrionial debts such as the one relating to the wife's need for a proper diet, a proper sleep schedule, a sufficient income to support an education and a reasonable income level for the wife, and an adequate retirement plan. The Court found that there was no evidence to support the claim that the wife had an unreasonable impoverishment and that her drug habit was caused by the husband's use of drugs. Therefore, the court was not free to exclude from the matrimony assets acquired by the wife prior to marriage such that her pension entitlement was reduced; she was also entitled to spousal support in the quantum of $1,600.00 as per annum.","The parties were married for twelve years; there were no children of the marriage. The husband was in the military; the wife was a cleaner on a military base when the parties met and she changed jobs at the husband's direction. She now stated that she was unable to return to work due to health problems, including irritable bowel syndrome, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. Both parties accused the other of conduct which diminished matrimonial assets. The wife's mother had advanced the parties a considerable amount of money during the marriage, with the final advance being the subject of an IOU. The husband is to be responsible for the matrimonial debts, with the net proceeds from the sale of matrimonial home to be paid ratably to those creditors; the wife is to receive 35% of the husband's pension entitlement; husband to pay spousal support in the amount of $1,000 per month for a period of ten years with the order open to variation if the wife obtains a C.P.P. disability pension or becomes fit to work or if the husband retires from the military or makes a proposal or an assignment in bankruptcy which has the effect of requiring the wife to pay any of the matrimonial debts."
"FIAT: The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent. The applicant asks for an order directing the Registrar of Titles to register the Plan of Proposed Subdivision with respect to Parcel G and to issue a Transform Approval Certificate. The requested relief cannot be provided unless the Court has authority to order a subdivision of land outside the requirements of the Planning and Development Act, 1983. HELD: The application is granted. The matter is directed to the Court of Appeal and directed to trial. 1) There are some distinguishing features. The original transaction appeared to have been concluded in an effort to avoid compliance with subdivision regulations, rather it was made in the mistaken belief that an already subdivided parcel was being transferred. The application in question was tantamount to a judicially ordered partition of land to avoid the effect of legislation. The Court was obliged to prevent such wholesale frustration of the legislature's objects. 2) While the Court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders, it is not within the Court's power to order the Registrar to effect subdivision contrary to the provisions of The Improvements Under the Mistake of Title Act. 3) The applicant has no right to subdivide save subject to the approval of the approving officer, who is required by the Act to determine if the contemplated development would be against the public interest. 4) The Court is cognizant of errors in law.","FIAT: The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding an un-subdivided parcel of land. The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act. The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3) The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues."
"At issue was a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The policy states that in order for a student who is a resident to return to the program, he must first obtain external funding. The College insists that this funding was depleted during the period of his suspension. The student insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. HELD: 1) The student was paid for period in excess of two years while he was suspended from the program. He was placed on probation for a further six months. His third party funding was reduced during the time he was on probation. 2) The applicant requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. There is no dispute that any exception to the policy would affect the integrity of the policy in the future. The fact that the student chose to have resort to the courts on two occasions suggests the jurisdiction is more original than traditional supervisory or appellate jurisdiction. 3) Although the student had not yet exhausted his appeals within the internal laws of the University, it was not clear whether the funding agency had any say in the College's decision to suspend him with pay.","The applicant is a doctor enrolled in the orthopaedic surgery residency training program at the University of Saskatchewan (University). He was suspended from the program since approximately March 2000. There have been a number of legal proceedings between the applicant and the University since then. An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms. This decision has not been implemented. At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The applicant is such a student. His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended. The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding. The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts. 2) The applicant is entitled to relief. The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met. The applicant must enter into a written agreement with the College of Medicine whereby he agrees that the money he was paid while on suspension is prepayment for all of the services he will perform for the College of Medicine in the remainder of his residency, that he will not claim any salary or monetary benefits available to other medical residents pursuant to the PAIRS agreement, and he will indemnify the College of Medicine if it is required to make payments to him pursuant to the PAIRS agreement during the remainder of his residency program. Further, PAIRS will enter into an agreement with the College of Medicine waiving the financial terms of the PAIRS agreement with respect to the applicant for the duration of his residency. 3) The applicant will be responsible for paying tuition fees, administration fees, insurance fees and any other college fees payable by other medical residents but he will be granted a credit for the fees deducted by the College of Medicine during the time he was suspended."
"The accused appeared before the Youth Court and entered or confirmed guilty pleas to 31 offences involving assaultive behaviour, threats, property damage and breach of court orders in relation to group home placements over a 14 month period between 2005 and 2006. The accused applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from a pre-sentencing conference held to consider recommendations on a youth sentence. The Crown and the accused sought a ruling from the court as to whether the public, including the media, should be permitted to attend the conference. HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the conference be held prior to the sentencing hearing.  1) Conferencing is new tool under the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) and is subject to a number of important statutory exceptions. The purpose of the conference is to give advice and provide recommendations on sentencing, which also is part of the court process. 2) The court must expect to be presented with evidence credible on its face of the anticipated risks that an open inquiry would present, including evidence of the adequacy of government programs and support for the young person who apparently suffers from mental health issues and who is in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services. The risk posed by the information shared is real, substantial and well grounded in the evidence.","A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference. The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals."
"The plaintiff, a cousin of the deceased, commenced an action to recover damages for nervous shock after a motor vehicle accident. The defendant was an uninsured motorist at the time of the accident. She was present when the accident occurred although she did not suffer any physical injuries and was not directly involved. She commenced this action to advance a claim for nervous shocks. The Plaintiff did not participate in the trial and had no interest of the outcome, the Facility Association and Wawanesa having together settled her claim. Upon consideration, the Court concluded that such was not the result. The emotional harm suffered by the Plaintiff was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties. The Court ordered that the Section D provisions of the M/V insurance policy issued by the defendant extend to protect the Plaintiff, who suffered a psychic injury as a result of the 'injury or death' of the Defendant, an 'insured person' under the policy?","The deceased's cousin commenced an action for nervous shock after she observed the accident in which the deceased bicyclist was killed. Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist, the Facility Association defended the plaintiff's action against him; however, the plaintiff also brought an action against the insurer of a motor vehicle policy under which the deceased was insured. At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff. The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties."
"The tenants applied for leave to appeal a Queen's Bench decision reviewing a decision of the Deputy Rentalsman granting an order of possession and issuing a writ of possession. Their reasons were that the rent was 15 days or more in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy was served and the tenant had failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice. HELD: Application allowed. 1) The tenants had until 4:00 p.m. on August 31, 2006 to serve and file their appeal book and factum. 2) The Chambers judge did not err in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid. 3) In answering the first question, did the Chambers judge err in the fact rent for August has not been paid, and not paid by required time, appeal is dismissed? 4) The landlord has 15 days from the date of the appeal to file a factum or factum under s. 47(1) of The Residential Tenancies Act to apply for a stay of execution.","The tenants apply pursuant to s. 49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench reviewing a decision of the Rentalsman. HELD: Application allowed.  1) The parties agree that the rent for July was paid on July 27. The landlord then immediately applied for and was granted a writ of possession. 2) The tenants advise that the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month rent of the tenancy. The landlord claims it is a security deposit. 3) The tenants claim they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arrears were accepted on that basis. 4) The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's appeal the same day saying 'the rent for August has not been paid and not paid by required time, appeal is dismissed'. 5) The first issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in finding the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make the order granting possession on the basis that 'the rent was 15 days in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice' if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession. The second issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid."
"FIAT: The applicant applies pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a variation of support for the parties' one child, Desiree May Braun-McLaughlan, born February 14, 1992. Mr. McLaughlan seeks both a variation in regard to his ongoing child support payments as well as rescission of arrears which have accumulated under the original child support order. HELD: 1) The respondent resides in British Columbia and the applicant is in Saskatchewan. The respondent was served with this motion in October 2006. It is in the Court's view that the ongoing support payments are currently being paid towards. Given that the respondent is currently earning the sum of $45,784 per year, he can afford to pay reasonable payment. 2) The applicant appears to be suggesting that his payment of ongoing support, and any payment he must make towards arrear, leaves him in financial difficulties, given he has remarried and has two more children. However, in order to allow the rescission application to proceed, would have to determine that he has, firstly, present inability to pay arreaars and, secondly, that he will not in the future be able to pay them. 3) The Court dismissed the respondent's application for rescission. It appears that the applicant has the ability to pay support in some of the years since the order was granted. He was stubborn. The applicant provides no evidence as why he earned little income from 1995 to 1998 and in 2002, and does not, in any way, suggest that he was ill, injured or unable to work for any reasonable reason.","FIAT: The applicant applies for a variation of support for the parties' one child, born in February 1992. The applicant seeks both a variation and rescission of arrears which have accumulated under the original support order. HELD: 1) The applicant has established the necessary change in circumstance, namely the introduction of the Guidelines. Based on the applicant's income, his child support payment is reduced from $500 per month to $425 per month.  2) The applicant is in arrears in the amount of $56,365.60. He has provided little explanation for his failure to pay the child support he was ordered to pay other than he was stubborn. It is apparent that he had the ability to pay. The application for rescission for arrears is dismissed."
"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over.08 contrary to S.253(b). The Crown appealed the acquittal on the charge under s.253B. HELD: The Court dismissed the appeal. 1) The delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained Shire in the locked police vehicle without arresting or advising him of his rights and while conducting a search of his vehicle is an error of fact. 2) There was no unlawful detention nor breach of the Charter. 3) In the circumstances of this case, the delay of approximately 17 minutes between the time the police was stopped and when the roadside screening demand was made took the demand outside of the 'forthwith' requirement of s.254(2). 4) The evidence obtained following the breach of Shire's Charter rights is conscriptive evidence. 5) Because there was an open container of alcohol (i.e. in a travel mug) found in the driver's seat, the police should have been prompted to make a demand.","The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed."
"The respondent is the owner of land located within the Rural Municipality of Edenwold No. 158. It was granted an order pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act, 2007, SS 2007, P-13.2 that required the respondent to comply with the orders made pursuant to the 2014 Order. The respondent took no significant steps to comply and, despite numerous court appearances and preparation of two memoranda and several affidavits, continued to use his land as a storage yard despite the court order requiring him to remove all of the offending equipment. The court found that this was not a case of the respondent having acted in high-handed manner either before or after the order. Rather, it was a situation that required a complete or near complete indemnification for costs reasonably incurred by the respondent. The Court awarded the respondent $15,000.00 in contempt of court costs, which included $5,000 in fines and solicitor/client costs, and added $10,000 to the respondent’s solicitor and client costs. The contempt application was adjourned to February 2, 2015, being the next closest date after the court ordered by the Development Officer. Costs of the contempt application were also increased by the amount of time requested by the applicant to be spent on preparing an affidavit. The applicant requested further legal fees and disbursements to be paid in accordance with the order and requested further adjournments to allow him to complete the purging of his contempt proceedings. HELD: The court held that the contempt proceedings were not for punishment per se but for upholding the rule of law and respect for court orders.  1)Saskatchewan Court of Appeal Rule 11-1(1)(a) provides for solicitor-client costs in exceptional circumstances including but not restricted to situations where the conduct of the party against whom they are awarded is scandalous, outrageous or reprehensible. It is also the means by which the RM has obtained authority, if necessary, to remedy the contravention of the Zoning Bylaw.  2)The respondent was awarded significant costs and added to the tax rolls for Parcel A and B and became liable if he did not purge his contempt within the time allotted by the Court. He will also be responsible for his own legal fees. 3)The court was concerned that any additional financial sanction may be more akin to punishment and may cause severe hardship to the appellant.","Civil Procedure – ContemptCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 11-16Municipal Law – Zoning Bylaw – Enforcement The applicant rural municipality was granted an order in May 2014 by a Queen’s Bench judge that directed the respondent to comply within 60 days with an order of the applicant’s development officer. That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time."
"HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge did not give a Vetrovec warning to either witness. The trial judge should have given the warning to both the appellant and his common law spouse. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed.  1) The appellant took the stand in his own defence. His version of events leading up to his interaction with the defendant and his friend had been largely premised on the defence counsel's insistence that the warning not be given. The appellate court noted that in some circumstances, the defendant's credibility may be inherently suspect if given in tandem with the testimony of the other witness. This is especially true where the witness who is inherently suspect, or who is for some reason unsavoury or disreputable, may give rise to high level of concern and warrant 'caution'. 2) In the circumstances, a trial judge must carefully assess the trustworthiness of Crown witnesses who seek to avoid prosecution or incarceration by testifying for the Crown. This factor on its own does not mandate a warning. Rather, the test of credibility is subject to considerable appellate deference. 3) The appeal centred on the issue of whether there was an error of law on the part of the trial court in failing to give a warning in relation to the two witnesses. While warning for accomplices had been automatic prior to the trial, the notion that all accomplices are, by their nature, unsavourful, was decidedly rejected by the Supreme Court. The Court found that a conviction on the basis that the defendant was guilty of the second degree murder of the appellant will result in a sentence of life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for 12 years.","Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference."
"The appellant appealed his conviction following a trial in the Supreme Court before a jury on a charge that he did assault a police officer engaged in the execution of his duties contrary to s. 270(2)(a) of the Criminal Code. The officers responded to a disturbance and found the appellant in a car. When the police officer asked the appellant his name, the appellant gave a fictitious one. The police officer testified that he had a warrant for the assault on the complainant. The appellant argued that the warrant was for assault causing bodily harm and that there were other warrants for the arrest. The trial judge mischaracterized the police constable's evidence as being for assault. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge failed to establish that the constable was in the proper execution of duty and that the reasonable grounds referred to in s. 495 of the Code were not questions to be put to the trial jury.","The appellant appealed his conviction for assaulting a police officer engaged in the execution of his duty. The police officer had responded to a call in connection with a disturbance during which the appellant assaulted a third person. Upon arriving at the scene the officer recognised the appellant as someone wanted by the police. The officer told the appellant that he was under arrest because of two outstanding warrants. The appellant assaulted the officer. The officer did not give evidence as to the grounds for his belief that the warrants met the s. 495(1)(c) Criminal Code requirement, i.e., that they were in a format set out in Part XXVIII and in force within the jurisdiction. In his charge to the jury the trial judge indicated that the arrest was for the assault against the third party and did not direct the jury to consider if the officer had reasonable grounds for believing that there were warrants outstanding. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the officer arrested the appellant for the assault on the third party and it was not made clear to the jury that they must make an essential determination if the officer had reasonable grounds as required in s. 495 of the Code, such that he was acting in the execution of his duty."
"This was an appeal from a judgment in the Supreme Court dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia) ordering Future Inns to reinstate the individual respondents, to pay them compensation, and to reconsider the first two orders. The Union appealed. Appeal allowed; order of Chambers judge set aside and matter remitted to the Board for a rehearing as per reasons for judgment of Chipman, J.A.; Matthews and Flinn, JJ.A. concurring. In this case, the Court found that the Board was not bound by legislation to provide reasons for its decisions and that in the absence of such a requirement reasons are not generally mandated.","This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board ordering the appellant to reinstate the respondents and pay them compensation for dismissing them due to their support of a union. The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing, that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record. In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial. As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons."
"The sole issue on appeal was whether a Provincial Court Judge is obligated to advise an unrepresented accused of his right to trial in either or both of the official languages of Canada pursuant to s. 530(1) of the Criminal Code. The sole ground of appeal relates to the failure of the Provincial Court judge to advise the appellant of his rights to be tried in either of the two official languages. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)Language rights are not negative rights, or passive rights; they can only be enjoyed if the means are provided. 2)The trial judge had no discretion and was obligated to put to the unrepresented the accused the right to a trial in one of the Official Languages of Canada or both.","This was an appeal to determine whether a Provincial Court judge is obliged to advise an accused of his right to a trial in either or both of the official languages of Canada, pursuant to s. 530 of the Code.

"The plaintiffs sought an accounting from their sister of her dealings with their mother's financial affairs pursuant to a Power of Attorney. The plaintiffs were five of the five children of Bessy Wright who died in August 1999 at the age of 86. The court found that the plaintiff had never suffered from any mental incapacity during her life time and therefore was not required to account to the plaintiffs for her dealings in her mother's finances. The plaintiff was awarded $4,875.00 in costs plus $1,745 to be taxed. The defendants were jointly and severely liable for the costs which may be deducted from their respective entitlements in the estate. Ordering the plaintiff's costs to be paid in full, that there was no evidence that the petitioner was mentally competent at the time of her death, nor was there co-mingling of the petitioner's money in this account.","The plaintiffs sought a detailed accounting from their sister of her dealings with their mother's financial affairs pursuant to a Power of Attorney prior to the mother's death. , plaintiffs' action dismissed; the defendant was not required to account to the plaintiffs for her dealings with her mother's finances. The mother was mentally competent and able to manage her own affairs at all times prior to her death; the Power of Attorney was granted solely for the mother's convenience as she was physically infirm. The daughter could only be called upon to account for her use of the Power of Attorney if it was used when the mother was incapacitated."
"The petitioner seeks an interim order setting his ongoing child support obligation as well as addressing the arrears. The parties subsequently entered into an agreement whereby the parties agreed the $300 per month would be greater than their legal obligation. Arrears have accumulated and he seeks to expunge them. The petitioner is part of a family farm operation. He supplements his farm income with working for part of the season at a local sporting store. This generates some rental income. The respondent takes the position that the petitioner's line 150 income does not reflect his ability to pay and that by reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. HELD: 1) The respondent is aware the petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues a reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the court is not prepared to impute income. 2) The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. 3) The court is cognizant of the fact that the respondent agreed to pay $300.00 per month non-taxable in 1992. He did nothing to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The court was not able to rescind any of the payments made in 2003. 4) Arrearns have accumulated. He is paying at a rate that is greater than his legal obligation and he is paying less tax. 5) There is money sitting in the Maintenance Enforcement Office as a result of federal intercept.","In January 1992, the parties agreed the petitioner would pay child support of $300 per month and that it would be without tax ramifications to either party. As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears."
"FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch and filed with the Court of Queen's Bench. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. HELD: 1) Does the Court have jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with this Court? 2) If so, what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the certificate? 3) In the case of adjudicator appeals, the Court has jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a true appeal that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. The reasoning of the Court in Farmers of North America is not applicable to these circumstances. 4) There are at least two bases upon which it can be found that the Court is clothed with jurisdiction to exercise its discretionary and provide remedy in appropriate circumstances. 5) The principles and the rules that flow from them and which have developed in relation to the opening up of noting for default and in setting aside default judgments ought not to be set aside. 6) The applicant did not meet the criteria necessary to establish that a director's certificate was properly issued and that an appeal pursuant to s. 62.4(1)(a) of The Labour Standards Act had the same force and effect as if it were a certificate obtained in a Queen’s Bench judgment for the recovery of debt. The consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 7) There is no evidence before the Court that would suggest or from which it could be reasonably inferred that the applicant cannot read or has any limitations that might effect his ability to understand the documentation served upon him. 8) The Court is cognizant of the fact that there are situations where it would be unfair to hold a party to an arbitrary deadline and hold them responsible for failing to file a statement of defence within the prescribed time frame. Such is the reasoning of this Court in Saskatchewan that it is without jurisdiction to open up a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures.","FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court."
"An appeal pursuant to s. 72 of The Residential Tenancies Act from a decision of a hearing officer appointed under the Act who, pursuant to ss. 58, 68 and 70 of the Act, ordered that the landlord be given possession of the tenant's rental unit and that a writ of possession be issued to place the landlord in possession. The grounds for the application were that the tenant had unreasonably disturbed other tenants within the meaning of ss. 68(2)(a)(i) and 68(1)(i). HELD: The material available for review is limited to the notice of appeal from the decision of the hearing officer filed by the appellant, the documents filed by both the appellant and hearing officer. The court is restricted to addressing questions of law or jurisdiction in this type of appeal. The tenant has not raised any true issue as to jurisdiction of the Court of Queen's Bench. The hearing officer had jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter in issue.","This is an appeal by the tenant, pursuant to s. 72 of the Residential Tenancies Act from a decision of the hearing officer appointed under the Act, who, pursuant to ss. 58, 68, and 70 of the Act, ordered that the landlord be given possession of the tenant's rental unit and that a writ of possession be issued to place the landlords in possession of the rental unit. HELD: The Court reviewed the facts and found the tenant had not raised any true issues as to the jurisdiction of the hearing. It was the Court's view that the hearing officer had jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter in issue. The notice of appeal and arguments presented by the tenant all relate to the facts as found by the hearing officer and contain no error of law. There were facts before the hearing officer to support his finding that the tenant had significantly disturbed other tenants. Further, the Court found there was ample evidence to support the hearing officer's decision on all his findings of fact. Appeal dismissed."
"The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking. He was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused's pre-sentence reports filed show that he had a less active role and he did not smash windows, inflict blows or inflict any blows. He had acted in threatening manner and held in his possession bear spray. HELD: The Court found that the predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Code. The Court ordered that the accused be convicted of the first two mos. of his secure custody disposition in open custody and that he was to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not exceeding fourteen years. The sentence was concurrent with a concurrent sentence of twenty-one months custody and supervision, twelve months secure custody followed by two months of open custody, and seven months supervision in the community. 1) The Court held that the offences committed were repetitive and that failure to restrain one’s behaviour would result in death, injury or severe psychological damage. 2) Given the conviction and the provisions for imprisonment the Court was satisfied there was a substantial similarity to the pattern of behaviour described in the books of R. v. Warawa (2011 ABCA 294). 3) The evidence from the sentencing hearing was sufficient to establish a pattern of repetitive behaviour. There was no indication of violence or threats to other persons. 4) The accused had a long record of offences. The offences fell within the range of offences under the category of'serious personal injury offences', which included aggravated assault, attempted murder, robbery, assault, assault with a weapon and possession of a weapon for a predicate offence.","The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b)."
"HELD: The Court sentenced the three accused pursuant to s. 267(b) and s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for breaking and entering and committing the offence of assault causing bodily harm on December 28, 2011. The three accused entered guilty pleas to using an imitation firearm while committing the offences of break and enter with intent to commit the assault contrary to s.(e) 85(2)(a) and (foster) in the amount of $2,000. The Crown sought a DNA order, a firearms prohibition and a forfeiture order in relation to the imitation firearm. The accused gave a statement to the police shortly after their arrest. They were assessed as being at medium risk to re-offend. The 9-1-1 recording brings home what was happening during that short but intense time period. HELD: A decision must be made with reference to the principles of sentencing.  1) The accused did not file a victim impact statement with the court and he was not overly cooperative with the Crown once he was out of custody. 2) The Court relied on the information contained in the pre-sentence report as well as the submissions by the counsel in respect to each accused. 3) The Crown was not able to delineate with any precision what each accused did in the house. The Court was unable to attribute comments made by the accused to any individual.  4) There was no evidence that any of the accused or any of their friends or family members were involved in the offence. The evidence was inconclusive as most of the time the conversation took place over a period of time. 5) There were no references to the presence of a pellet gun in the home or the manner in which it was used. It would appear that the accused engaged in activity which incited these three accused to take some action once their complaints to police went unaddressed. The pellet guns were used to attack the victim and his brother. The 3 accused who were convicted of common law offences (including driving while over.08) have a significant criminal record. They have a previous criminal record for driving over. 6) The sentences imposed are proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.","HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation. The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge. All accused were given an 18-month probation period to follow their incarceration. Terms of the probation included counselling as required and no contact with the victim."
"The Ministry sought a permanent wardship order with respect to two children. The parents of the children, despite being more or less involved with the proceedings for some of the period since the action was commenced, did not appear for the trial of the action. HELD: The Court found the children to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry presented its evidence completely and provided a full and complete argument in support of its recommendation in this matter. Counsel for the children participated fully in the trial process and presented argument in advocating for the interests of these children. Decisions like this one are life-changing for so many people. The children have proven resilient, the parents are engaged with the criminal justice system, the father is involved in serious matters, the children have been exposed to harmful interaction for sexual purpose and the father has been absent from the children's lives for the past 3 years. The Court concluded that good intentions by themselves were not sufficient to enable the father to continue to abuse these children and that his failure to take measurable steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues would result in the children suffering physical harm at the hands of their father.","HELD: The order was granted. Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order."
"The respondents applied to the Court of Queen's Bench by notice of motion for a declaration that the intensive livestock operation being constructed by the Kelvington Super Swine Inc. (KSS) at Kelvingtons is a development pursuant to s. 2(d) of The Environmental Assessment Act. The respondents also requested an order for mandamus compelling KSS to conduct an environmental assessment of the development as required by s. 9 of the Act. KSS applied for intervenor status because of its involvement in similar projects in the province. The issue on appeal was whether the project was a development as defined by s2(d); whether the respondents had standing to privately enforce a public right; whether the applicant should be required to conduct environmental assessment pursuant to the provisions of s9 of the Environmental Assessment act; whether KSS should be permitted to operate an intensive hog operation on the Clark and NBC properties pursuant to The Agricultural Operations Act and whether the appellants had standing by that designation. HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the proposal was not a developing as defined in s2d of the environmental assessment act and that it was not necessary to consider whether the applicants or the respondents have standing to file an intervenor right. The KSS project was not developing as a development under the Environmental assessment Act as the proposed activity was not development under that Act. As the respondents were concerned about potential changes to the environment, their concerns were not wide-spread. Even if the respondents applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari to set aside the order of the Minister of Agriculture as opposed to applying for declaration of the project, the relationship between the environmental assessments and the Agricultural Operations and the Ag Operations Act was not satisfied. The matter was remitted to the court for final determination. The chambers judge did not permit the application of the respondent requesting intervenor rights.","The respondents applied for a declaration that the intensive livestock operation being constructed by Kelvington (KSS) was a development pursuant to s2(d) of the Environmental Assessment Act (EAA) and sought an order for mandamus compelling KSS to conduct an environmental assessment as required by s9 of the EAA. Yellow Quill First Nation applied for intervenor status. The trial judge found, without giving reasons, that the project was a development as defined in the Environmental Assessment Act and the application for mandamus was adjourned sine die. HELD: The appeal was granted and the order set aside without costs. 1)The proposal was not a development as defined in s 2(d) of the EAA. The Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment and Resource Management were of the opinion that the KSS project was not a development as defined in the Act as it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s2(d). 2)The Environmental Assessment Branch was of the opinion that no significant impacts on the environment would occur or if they do, mitigation measures would be implemented to reduce or eliminate the potential for significant environmental impact.  3)It was not necessary to decide whether Yellow Quill or the respondents had standing to privately enforce a public right. 4)In light of the decision the following were not in issue: whether the respondent should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari; the relationship between the Environmental Assessment and Agricultural Operations Act; and whether a proponent of an intensive livestock operation can be required to make an application under the Agricultural Operations Act and to carry out an environmental impact assessment under s9 of the EAA."
"The applicant sought 13 orders of production for documents prepared by and in the possession of her service providers. The Minister was requesting the records as part of a protection proceeding. The applicant argued that this was a high threshold for a protection application, and that the documents would not be able to be produced because of their complexity and complexity. Application dismissed; the court found that the requirements of the protection order were high and that obtaining the records would not save costs. The court also found that it would not accept the applicant's repeated requests for documents as proof of the Protection Finding; the records were not relevant to the applicant’s present circumstances and would not assist in the preparation of the parental capacity assessment. The requirement to obtain the records, which must be obtained by means other than obtaining a Order of Production, was not a high priority.","The Minister sought numerous orders for production of medical and various other files (including the mother's complete medical files from her family physician, the Nova Scotia Hospital and another hospital, and her files from a woman's shelter and an addiction treatment and prevention service) in an ongoing child protection proceeding. The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest."
"The Department of Community Resources seeks orders pursuant to The Child and Family Services Act placing the respondent with the Department until age 18 and placing the child with his grandmother as a Person of Sufficient Interest pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children have the same biological parents. The respondent does not oppose the applications in respect of the respondent but seeks the return of the child to her care. HELD: The respondent did not attend the pre-trial or trial. The trial commenced June 26, 2006 and concluded September 29, 2006. The child is 11 years old and in Grade 8. The parties agree that the child is in need of protection. The Court finds that the children have been in the care of the Department since April 30, 2004. The Children are in the Care of the Minister until their 16th birthday. The matter was set to be reviewed and the trial ordered to continue until the completion of the trial. Child protection is a serious issue and the Court ordered that the evidence be examined to determine the extent to which the Court believes that the respondent has a sufficient interest in the child.","The Department of Community Resources (DCR) seeks orders pursuant to The Child and Family Services Act (the Act) placing CS with the Department until age 18 pursuant to s. 37(2) and JS with his grandmother as a Person of Sufficient Interest pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care. HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period. JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court. This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs. The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. 3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time. KS has quit drinking. TK is now employed. KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction. The parents have a residence. TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health. DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time. TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children. The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser. The success of the involvement of DCR in the life of this family would be enhanced with the assignment of another worker."
"Dr. Huerto commenced an action in Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts for medical services provided by the Government of Saskatchewan. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 accounts. The appellant appealed from that judgment. Appeal dismissed; cross-appeal dismissed. The aspects of the Protocol that allow the Government to request more information about the services underpinning an account are invalid because they amount to an attempt to regulate his pattern of practice. The Protocol is an individualized administrative process and the aspects which deal with the AU code are designed to facilitate the payment of an account and, in appropriate situations, to deny payment. Such matters can only be addressed through a JMPRC established pursuant to s. 49.2 of the MCIA. HELD: Both the appeal and the appeal must be dismissed. 1) The principles of the payment schedule are outlined in the Physician Payment Schedule (PPS) referenced in s. 3(d) and 6(1)(d) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Payment Regulations. 2) The payment schedule allows the Government in at least some circumstances (perhaps in the summer or fall of 1994) to request further information concerning the particular service provided to a specific patient. It does not deny payment for that service. In the case of the 16 accounts, the physician chose not to respond to the Government's requests for further information. As a practical consequence of that decision, he received no payment for the services in issue. His claim for reimbursement was dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. 3) The large majority of the physician's claims are barred because they were not submitted within 6 months of the date the services were provided. The trial judge should have declined jurisdiction because the physician failed to take advantage of the internal appeal procedures available to physicians dissatisfied with the Government’s assessment of their accounts.  4) The Protocol ties directly into the “Assessment Rules” portion of the Payment Schedule. It states that accounts may be adjusted with reference to the relationship between the service being billed and prior or subsequent services and in addition to the submission of claims for related services. In this case, a significant number of the accounts were marked with the code in accordance with the provisions of that agreement.  5) The standard procedure, which are at the heart of the appeal, is standard tests and not 'unusual’ in and of themselves.","This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive."
"The victim of a drive-by shooting appealed his sentence of 365 days, comprised of 243 days custody followed by 122 days supervision in the community. Prior to being remanded, the victim had been asked to leave the high school he had previously attended as a result of concern for his and other students' safety after threats had been made against him. The victim was standing on a street corner when the accused was shot in the back with a rifle. The accused was charged with aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. He had been convicted of five breaches of probation, two breaches of undertaking, and two resisting arrest/obstruction charges. He was on an undertaking to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. HELD: The application for release pending appeal was dismissed. 1)Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault offence, his record of violent offences, and the numerous breaches of court orders, the Court was not persuaded that his release would be in the public interest. 2)The accused will suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody until his appeal is heard. He will likely already have served more than what is determined to be a fit sentence, and thereby suffer undue hardship if he is not released. The Youth Criminal Justice Act requires strict conditions to be met in order for a young person to attend school. 3)The Court was concerned that the accused would fall behind in schoolwork and be unable to complete his high school education in a timely fashion.","The young person appealed his sentence on an aggravated assault conviction following a drive-by shooting and applied for release pending appeal. Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school. Application for release pending appeal dismissed. The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest."
"The accused entered guilty pleas to three charges. The first two were sexual assaults. The accused claimed to have been touched by the accused in his sleep. The second was digital penetration. Both victims testified that the accused touched their skin and skin with his penis. The Court found that both victims were sexually assaulted by the defendant on numerous occasions. The Crown sought a sentencing hearing pursuant to section 724(3)(e). The accused agreed to a sentencing hear. The court was satisfied that both the victims were assaulted by him on numerous occasion. The evidence established that the abuse occurred over several years, many times and that the defendant took every chance he could to get more. The offences occurred on every occasion the victims lived in the company of the girls. The defendant got bolder as time passed and took more liberties and chances. The Crime Victims Association (CWA) reported that the alleged offences occurred over a period of several years. The alleged digital penetration occurred over multiple years. HELD: The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that both victim reports were sexually sexually assaulted. The sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasions the accused was in the presence of the young girls. These sexual assaults occurred on numerous times. The Defendant took every opportunity to get even more.","The accused plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault. The victims were his granddaughters. The assaults were alleged to have occurred between 1983 and 1991. A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts. The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims."
"The appellant appeals against conviction and sentence of a charge under s.253(2)(b) of The Traffic Safety Act, S.S. 2004. HELD: The appeal is taken on the following ground: Judge failed to give proper legal effect to evidence that did not know there was problem until came out of the store was confronted by the owner of the car. The finding of the trial judge that the appellant must have known an accident had taken place before entering the store is contrary to the preponderance of evidence. The verdict is unreasonable, the appellant argues, since he had no duty to report an accident which he didn't know had happened prior to returning from the store. There was no palpable or overriding error.","The appellant appealed his conviction under s. 253(2)(b) of The Traffic Safety Act for failing to provide his name, address, licence and registration at the scene of an accident. The appellant argued that he was unaware that an accident had occurred and argued that the trial judge's finding that he must have known the accident had occurred was contrary to the evidence. The appellant also argued that the trial judge erred in preferring the evidence of the Crown's witness over his own. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge gave sufficient reasons for her decision and took all of the relevant evidence into consideration. She was entitled to assess the credibility of the independent witness and to prefer it over the evidence of the appellant."
"The appellant mortgagee unsuccessfully sought a deficiency judgment against the respondent, Bezanson, a guarantor of the covenants of a mortgage given by Seawood Enterprises Ltd. to Prenor. The mortgage fell into arrears and the appellant, the only bidder at the sale, bought in the property at $10,731.84. It then commenced foreclosure proceedings against the respondents, the respondent and one other guarantor. Seawsood denied the application and the application was dismissed with costs to the respondent. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and giving judgment to the appellant for $186,386, with interest at 6% from August 14, 1992, costs of the chambers application of $1,500 plus disbursements, and $600 from the appeal of $600. The order of May 1992 had resolved the issue of the timeliness of the appellant's deficiency judgment.","The appellant mortgagee appealed a chambers decision denying it a deficiency judgment on the basis the application was not made within the time limit set out in the Civil Procedure Rules. The appellant had relied on a prothonotary's order extending the time to apply for a deficiency judgment, which the prothonotary did not have authority to give. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the chambers decision and giving judgment to the appellant. While the prothonotary did not have jurisdiction to extend the time for the application, an additional chambers order had resolved the timeliness issue in the appellant's favour."
"The plaintiff was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident. His automobile was struck from behind. He was driving. His wife was front seat passenger. He had been unable to work for several days. The plaintiff spent many days and weeks visiting the defendant's hospital and working on his farm. He suffered a very serious neck injury, which rendered him completely and permanently disabled for any type of employment. The defendant's expert acteduarial and prepared a detailed report for the court. He prepared a colored brochure for the plaintiff, which he then prepared as a complete package. He then prepared a forecast of the current market value of the real and personal property, excluding furnishings, farmlands and woodlands. He spent six weeks in the hospital. He lost his job and was unable to move. The court rejected the plaintiff's report as being able to help him find employment. It was not enough for the defendant to urge that leave be granted because defence counsel was sufficiently skilled, prepared and experienced to deal with its late introduction. The judge properly reviewed the case law and found that the plaintiff had suffered a serious injury. The plaintiffs' financial records show an aberation in 1986. His car was struck in an intersection. He estimated his loss at $47,000.00 per year. His family was not economically viable. He now suffered from severe neck injuries. He could not work any more. He needed to restructure his business and find employment, which would allow him to continue his farming business. He also needed to find employment where he could find employment again. The Court rejected the expert's report finding that his findings did not support the 10% growth rate upon which he based his opinion. The Judge found that leave was granted to waive the clear requirements of C.P.R. 31.08.","The 53-year-old plaintiff suffered a neck injury (cervical dystonia) in a car accident. After undergoing treatment from 14 specialists, the plaintiff had little relief four years following the accident. He was rendered permanently disabled from all work for which he was trained and could no longer work the farm, sawmill or Christmas tree operation he had developed. Assessing non-pecuniary damages at $60,000. In assessing pecuniary damages, the court accepted the defendant's expert evidence which led to the conclusion the plaintiffs businesses were marginally profitable. The defendants were ordered to pay $30,000 as real, net loss of future income. The court approved a 5% capitalization rate as being appropriate where there was an eight year term to age 65. The plaintiff settled his future Section B benefits just before trial. The court rejected the defence argument that they were entitled to a credit for present value of those benefits which represented a figure over seven times the settlement figure. The defendants were only entitled to a credit for sums actually paid to the plaintiff. The court rejected the plaintiff's actuarial report as being late and in breach of Civil Procedure Rule 31.08."
"The appellant appealed his conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drugs. The Provincial Court Judge had reserved his decision and then found him guilty. Summary Conviction Appeal Court Justice Charles E. Haliburton dismissed the appeal. The appellant sought leave to appeal and if that is permitted, appeals that latter decision. At issue was whether the trial judge erred in law by entering a conviction when the form of Information before the Court was not bilingual in form contrary to s. 841(3) of the Criminal Code and in failing to enunciate his findings of fact in reaching the conclusion that the accused 'knew or ought to have known of the effects of the drug that he was taking'. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The trial judge's decision was supported by the evidence.","The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while impaired. His conviction was upheld on appeal to a summary conviction appeal court. This appeal was based on the argument the provincial court judge's decision failed to provide reasons for accepting the evidence of various witnesses, failed to make findings of credibility with respect to witnesses, and failed to comment on the credibility and evidence of the witnesses. The appellant complained the judge did not provide adequate reasons for the decision. Dismissing the appeal, that the decision was supported by the evidence. The court referred to R. v. Burns, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656 at 664, where the Supreme Court of Canada held that if trial judges state their conclusions in brief, and these conclusions are supported by the evidence, the verdict should not be overturned merely because they fail to discuss collateral aspects of the case."
"The applicants applied for an order setting aside an arbitration award made by the employer. The union alleged that the employer violated Article 23.01 of the collective agreement by the manner in which the promotion of lieutenants was conducted. The employer sought to use inexperienced personnel in an acting capacity until a new routine was devised. The grievance arose through arbitration pursuant to a collective agreement between the parties and the union alleges the employer conducted a promotional routine for the positions of lieutenant and captain every two years. The applicants claimed the employer had interfered in the grievance by failing to provide specific time and place to the union representatives. Dismissing the application for a stay of proceedings, that the Court has jurisdiction to hear the application and to order an adjournment of the arbitration award. On the issue of costs, the Court would order costs in the cause.","The applicants sought a stay of proceedings pending review of an arbitration award. The union had alleged the employer violated the collective agreement by the way positions for the rank of lieutenant were filled in the fire department two years prior. As a result of the arbitration award, several lieutenants were demoted to the rank of firefighter. Denying the stay, that (1) there was no arguable issue to be tried on appeal; (2) there was no evidence the applicants would suffer irreparable harm if the stay were not granted; (3) the balance of convenience weighed against the applicants; and (4) there were no exceptional circumstances."
"The appeal was put to the Court below prematurely, with the result that it was put on what was essentially a hypothetical basis, and Charter decisions should not be made without sufficient factual base. There was no evidence put before the Court that the appellants or any of them had yet suffered any adverse consequences as result of the impugned legislation, although proceedings were pending before the Labour Relations Board which might result in adverse consequences. More particularly, there was no suggestion that anyone had lost their job or had been in any way penalized for refusing to either pay union dues or to join the union, nor was there any evidence as to why anyone objected to being a member of the bargaining unit in question or the union in question so as to permit any reasoned decision as to the alleged right not to associate. The respondents had their costs of the appeal under double col. V, except the Attorney General who did not ask for costs. Appeal dismissed.",Members of the Association of Professional Engineers who were also SIAST employees challenged the statutory provisions and collective bargaining agreement whereby they were compelled to become members of the SGEU. In Queen's Bench it was held that the statutory provisions which created two bargaining units for institute employees and required certain employees to be union members did not violate s.2(d) of the Charter. Appeal dismissed
"The appellants appealed the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act's decision to require them to pay off the discharge on the condition that they did not engage in any fraud or attempt to obtain a false identity. The judge found that the discharges had not been obtained by fraud and dismissed the appellants' appeal. HELD: The appeal, insofar as it is based on s. 180(2) of the Bankolveny and Insulcy Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, as am. by S.C.(1992) c. 27, must be dismissed because the judge found the disbursement had not be obtained by fraudulent, and we can find no error in that determination.",FIAT An application was taken under s.180(2) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to set aside a bankrupt's discharge on the basis that it was obtained by fraud. A Queen's Bench Chambers Judge dismissed the application. This decision was appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Court found no error in the trial judge's determination.
"The plaintiff suffered a concussion, hearing loss in his left ear, neck injury and knee injuries when he was hit by a motor vehicle. The flare-ups of pain since the motor vehicle accident had been more severe than those prior to the accident. The onus is on the plaintiff to establish negligence. The plaintiff's inattention, coupled with a higher rate of speed than she estimates, rendered her solely responsible for the accident and she was not justified in entering the lane of opposing traffic.","The 46-year-old male plaintiff suffered damage to his knee, left ear and exacerbation of a back problem when his vehicle was struck by the defendant's vehicle. Finding the defendant solely at fault, that evidence from the accident reconstruction as to the angle of impact supported a conclusion the defendant was travelling faster than she realized and was inattentive. Damages were set as follows: impairment to hearing in left ear assessed at $8500, damage to left knee assessed at $2500. Exacerbation of a pre-existing back condition which produced consequences in the severe range was assessed at $31,500."
"This was an application pursuant to ss. 58 and 59 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for the approval of a proposal made pursuant to s. 50 of the Act by Gustafson Pontiac Buick Cadillac GMC Ltd. to its various creditors. HELD: 1)An application was opposed by one of the creditors. Oak Bluff Estates Ltd. (Oak Bluff) was in opposition to the application for Court approval. 2)Under s. 59(2), the court must consider not only the wishes and interests of creditors but also the public and future creditors and the requirements of commercial morality. 3)The proposal was primarily calculated to benefit the Prairie Security Fund and the guarantors of the secured creditors and not the general body of creditors. The fact that any payment to the unsecured creditors is dependant upon successful negotiations with the Bank of Montreal, Prairie Security fund and an outside investor. The proposal is effectively nothing more than a 'holding proposal'.","An application was brought under ss.58 and 59 of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act seeking approval for a proposal made by Gustafson Pontiac Buick. The proposal had received the necessary proportion of support from Gustafson's creditors. One unsecured creditor opposed the application. HELD: 1)Under s. 59(2), before it can approve a proposal, the Court must be satisfied; (a) that the terms are reasonable; (b) that the terms are calculated to benefit the general body of creditors; and (c) that the proposal is made in good faith. 2)In determining whether to approve a proposal, the court must consider not only the wishes and interests of creditors, but also the conduct and interests of the debtor, the interests of the public and future creditors and the requirements of commercial morality. 3)If, however, a large majority of creditors, i.e., substantially in excess of the statutory majority, have voted for acceptance of a proposal, it will take strong reasons for the court to substitute its judgment for that of the creditors. 4)Gustafson had met the criteria set out in the Act and the authorities referred to in Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law of Canada, and accordingly the proposal was approved."
"The accused was charged with three counts under the Criminal Code following an unlawful assault against a peace officer. He was acquitted on all charges. The accused appealed. He appealed the verdict of the Youth Court trial, arguing that the trial judge based her decision on considerations not supported in the evidence. Allowing the appeal and allowing the appeal to proceed, that a trial judge must be vigilant to avoid simply expanding upon reasons previously given or providing reasons where none were given at trial. A new trial is ordered, and a new trial will be held on the same grounds as the original decision.","The young offender appealed his convictions contending an apprehension of bias on the part of the Youth Court Judge who made comments about the police and non-white accused. The Judge also wrote supplementary reasons after the appeal was filed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial in front of a different trial judge, that there was no evidence before the Youth Court Judge as to the comments made. The court applied an objective test and concluded a reasonable apprehension of bias existed. Supplementary reasons should not be written without a request from the Court of Appeal."
"An appeal from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend. The appellant was the primary insurer as the holder of the blanket fleet coverage of the respondent. When the provisions of the policy are ambiguous, the judge may conclude that there is no duty to defend because the Honda involved is not insured by Royal. The chambers judge erred in his application of the principles of contract interpretation when he decided the Honda was not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the Royal policy. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The chambers judge did not define the scope of his inquiry. He simply said in response to Guardian's argument that it merely must raise an arguable point that the standard suggestion by Guardian was 'off target'. 2)The difficulty with a chambers judge engaging in an extensive inquiry into policy coverage in an application to defend arises when he ultimately rules there is a no obligations to defend but submitted that Royal also has a duty to indemnify. 3)A more restricted inquiry on s.209(1) application could reduce the potential for inconsistent judgments created by the operation of s. 209(1). However, this does not preclude a judge sitting at the outset from interpreting policy and determining whether the insurer would defend. In some circumstances such as this, the chambers judge may be required to embark on an extensive review. 4)The plaintiff has no duty at all to defend when a policy clearly does not provide coverage for that which is alleged in the pleadings.","Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored."
The accused was convicted of sexual assault. The Crown sought a sentence of 1/2 to years for a sexual assault where there was no prior romantic connection between the victim and the accused and claimed the property damage and vandalism had nothing to do with the offence. HELD: A sentence of 18 months in a provincial correctional centre was justified. A three year sentence was to be increased or decreased from the three year term based on the circumstances of the individual case. A lengthy sentence will seriously affect the accused's ability to rehabilitate. A sentence other than a custodial sentence would not meet the fundamental principle referred to in s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code which permits the court to allow the accused to serve his term in the community. The section has just recently come into force. There are no judicial cases applying this section in sexual assault cases.,"The accused, convicted of sexual assault, requested a non-custodial sentence pursuant to s742.1 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was sentenced to 18 months in a provincial correctional institution. 1)It would be contrary to the administration of justice in view of the seriousness of the offence to allow the accused to serve his sentence within the community even though he appeared to satisfy the requirements of s.742.1(a) and (b) of the Code. There were numerous adverse impacts on the victim. 2)Mitigating circumstances included the absence of a criminal record; his abstinence from alcohol since the assault; the absence of penile penetration; his remorse and apology to the victim and to the court; his serious health problems; his ability to rehabilitate and the fact that he was a model citizen prior to the assault."
"This was an appeal from the decision of a chambers judge striking the appellant's Statement of Claim. The appellant and the respondent had equal shareholders in a company that incorporated Gorbin. The alleged that the appellant placed a $75,000 second mortgage on property owned by the company without the appellant' knowledge or consent. The shareholder's resolutions and banking resolutions required the signatures of both the appellant and Gordon on legal documents and cheques. The respondent bank endorsed that cheque on behalf of the appellant. The appeal was allowed with costs in the amount of $350 and on the appeal in the sum of $750 plus disbursements. In a case such as this, Civil Procedure Rule 25.01 is not applicable. In such a case, it was unnecessary for the judge to consider the application under Rule 14.25.","This was an appeal from the decision of a chambers judge striking the appellant's Statement of Claim under Rule 25.01 for being outside the limitation period. The parties did not submit an agreed Statement of Facts. Allowing the appeal, that the chambers judge erred in proceeding with the application pursuant to Rule 25.01. Rule 25.01 requires that the parties file an agreed Statement of Facts, save in exceptional circumstances, such as one where the material facts are clearly not in dispute."
"FIAT. The chambers judge on the return date granted an order directing the defendants to respond to the undertakings given in the examination for discovery of Krake. The order follows: 1) the defendants are required to answer certain questions relating to audit issues arising in the context of Saskatchewan Trust Company records or files, which documents were not originally disclosed in the Statement as to Documents of and which were refused to be disclosed at the examination. 2) the plaintiff is ordered to answer all questions related to the action and to make full disclosure of any documents requested by the plaintiff that may be of interest to his adversary or may fairly lead to a form of inquiry which may have either of these consequences. 3) The plaintiff has failed to provide proper information to the defendants as to any of the matters raised by its pleadings. The plaintiff is also requesting further and better description of documents. The only issue that could be raised was whether the documents were properly described and identified so that the plaintiff's adversary would not be subject to trial by ambush.  4) The Court concluded that the disclosure and production were justified under the 'broad relevance' test and comports with the general principle that a party is entitled to discovery of a document or record if it directly or indirectly enables him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary, or may provide an agent for a new line of inquiry. 5) There was no basis for a pre-trial conference until the action was ready for trial.",HELD: 1)The officer was to answer any proper questions seeking his opinion on audit issues arising in the context of the Trust Company's records or files. To be proper the questions need only be broadly relevant to the issues raised in the pleadings in the sense that they are in some way connected to the allegations made. Hypothetical questions seeking his opinion consequent upon his professional experience could be asked where his and C&amp;L's conduct were in issue. The officer's expert opinion could not be sought on matters not raised in the pleadings. 2)The disclosure and production of documents was justified under the broad relevance test. A party is entitled to discovery of a document if it directly or indirectly enables him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary or may fairly lead to a form of inquiry which may have either consequence. 3)The 'damage claim documents' had been provided. There should be a sameness in the manner and isolation of the documents in the discovery process undertaken by each party. Whether the memoranda of discussions with third parties were privileged or irrelevant was a matter for the trial judge. 4)The issue of compelling a response to undertakings had been resolved. 5)The request for an order for an immediate pre-trial conference was redundant as there was no basis for one until the action was ready for trial. 6)Leave to further amend the statement of claim pursuant to Rule 165 had been granted.
"The primary issue was the appropriate parenting arrangement for the two children. The petitioner was the primary caregiver and the respondent's parents played a substantial role in the day-to-day care of the children. HELD: 1)The children were to be looked after by their paternal grandparents with the exception of two or three days spent with a babysitter. The respondent bore the larger share of the responsibility for breakdown in communication and ultimate inability of the parties to show more flexibility. 2)The petitioner was to have weekly telephone access with the children and access at such other times as the parties may agree. The father was to pay child support of 54% of the net cost of child care expenses incurred as a result of the petitioner's employment. In the event that either party intends to change his or her residence, the father shall have access one evening per week until 8:00 p.m. 3)The parents were to have regular weekly parenting time together except during the week leading up to a statutory holiday when the father was off work.  4)The father's access went beyond the minimum required by the interim order. He sought and was given every weekend. The mother was sensitive to the children's needs and supported their relationship with the paternal grandparents. It was important to maintain a level of flexibility that would allow both parents to reach their full potential. The child's health was best served by an education program. 5)The parties were to agree by June of each year on the division of the summer holiday period.  6)The mother was to designate one day per week to participate in the school activities and the father's parenting time was to be extended to include the statutory holiday. 7)The child support was to include child support for one week at a time.  8)The respondent was to make an order respecting the custody arrangement for Travis and Jonathan. 9)Costs including one-half of the cost of care for the children were awarded to the mother. 10)The court accepted the characterization that the parents were very good parents who could not demonstrate an ability to co-parent more effectively. They are both somewhat responsible for the present state of affairs. It is clear the children are close to their maternal grandparents. The grandparents have provided extensive child care services in the past and are prepared to continue to do so. There were occasions when the respondent would not be working and rather have the children spend the day with him, he chose to work two days per week, except when he was working overtime. The court was satisfied that the","The primary issue was the appropriate parenting arrangement for the two children. The 1997 interim order awarded joint custody with the primary residence with the mother and reasonable access to the father including alternating weekends, reasonable telephone access and equal sharing of holidays. The father initially failed to pay child support as ordered then paid $250 per month rather than the $424.72 ordered. The parties no longer communicated directly with each other except by e-mail so that there was a record. HELD: 1)It was in the best interests of the children that their primary residence be with their mother. She had demonstrated greater flexibility and sensitivity to their needs. The father was granted access two weekends out of every three and additional time as they may agree upon. Although both were very good parents the parties had not demonstrated an ability to co-parent effectively as illustrated by their communication problems. The father's access initially went beyond the minimum required by the interim order. He failed to make support payments as ordered. The father was to pay child support of $449. Pursuant to s.7 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines he was to pay 54% of the net cost of child care expenses incurred as a result of the mother's employment and for health related expenses in excess of $100 of the insurance reimbursement upon production of receipts.  2)The automobile constituted matrimonial property and was valued at $200. 3)Either could speak to costs."
"The paternal grandparents sought an order granting them access to their grandson, R.D.G., born December 1995, pursuant to s. 6.1(1) of the Children's Law Act, 1997. The applicant paternal grandparents opposed the access and suggested that any access being exercised by the applicants should be exercised during the access periods granted to their son, P.J.B. HELD: The paternal grandparents were to be granted access one Saturday every two months. The access period was to be less frequent than that which would be granted to the child's father. The Court was of the view that it would be in the best interests of the child to have some ongoing relationship with both his maternal grandparents and his paternal grandparents.",HELD: The grandparents were granted access one Saturday every second month from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. It would be in the best interests of the child to have some ongoing relationship with both his maternal and paternal grandparents. The father lived in Alberta and may not be able to exercise the degree of access he was seeking. The relationships were separate with unique characteristics.
"The accused applies for a remedy pursuant to s. 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The application is based primarily on the accused's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time. HELD: 1) The length of delay is 8.5 months. The preliminary hearing was adjourned to June 8. 2) The delay is sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay. 3) The Crown has conceded its responsibility for the delay. In requesting an adjournment of the preliminary hearing, the defence sought to have the matter proceed from the charge to trial within 10 to 14 months. 4) The defence suffered an unnecessary additional 9 months of unemployment, economic hardship and other prejudice in the form of embarrassment from the numerous media reports of the charges. 5) The accused has been extremely active politically. He won the 1996 election by a tie-breaking vote. The validity of the election was challenged and he was unable to participate in the 1998 preliminary hearing. The outstanding charges had clearly prevented him from maintaining his previously active participation in band politics. He was committed to stand trial on the remaining fraud charges.  6) The trial judge must be satisfied that the accused and society in a prompt trial outweighs the interest of society in bringing those charged with criminal offences to trial. The balancing of competing interests is difficult but in this case the prejudice to the accused was substantial. The accused was apparently not even close to being ready to proceed nor did he give any real explanation for his failure to comply with his self-acknowledged legal obligation to provide disclosure.","The accused, Cote, applied for remedy pursuant to s.24 of the Charter of Rights stating that he was denied the right to be tried on a fraud charge within a reasonable time. Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon."
"FIAT. The defendant represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation (SCIC). The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed resulted from the actions of SCIC. The plaintiff's officer met with the farmers and the defendant to discuss the case, the evidence and the strategies to be followed. The hope was that the provincial agency might settle before trial. HELD: The portions of the affidavit that were objected to were struck. The only conclusion that can be drawn from the facts is that the respondent guaranteed the payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. The addition of the word protect puts the question beyond doubt.  1) The General Rules require an undertaking be given to a solicitor on a contingency basis to ensure that the parties pay the defendant's disbursements. 2) The solicitor agreed to defer payment of his account from the parties until the successful conclusion of the litigation with SCIC (Q.B. Rule 129) or Rule 488 (Simplified Procedure).  3) The affidavit is not evidence but hearsay and opinion. If more were needed, one need only note that these statements of account were all directed to the respondent without objection.  His inquiry of March 12, 1997 makes it clear also that the lawyer recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the matter of his client's account.  4) In other words, the solicitor was not bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees.","FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty. In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt. His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account."
"The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant. However, neither the accused nor the complainant, due to their respective self-induced states of intoxication, had any memory of the sexual intercourse. HELD: The accused was acquitted. 1) The Court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self- induced intoxication. The Court must assess the capacity of the witness to accurately recall and relate to events that occurred before, during and immediately after the alleged assault. 2) In sexual assault cases, the defence of 'extreme drunkenness' is successful in the rarest of cases. The accused contends that at the time he was assaulted, he was so intoxicated that he was not in conscious state and was incapable of forming any reasonable belief that the complainant was consenting. 3) In a case like the one before me, the Court was unable to understand how someone who was so grossly intoxicated could be capable of having sexual intercourse that involved penetrating the complainant and ejaculating semen into her vagina. There was no evidence tendered at the trial that was inconsistent with the accused's testimony. Neither was there anything inconsistent with his evidence as to the state of his intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication."
"The Crown appealed a summary conviction appeal by the Crown that was brought when the trial judge dismissed charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08 percent. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of the Crown's proceeding was an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)The trial judge erred in law in finding that the court had lost jurisdiction as he specifically found that if there was loss of jurisdiction it was over the offence. 2)When the Alberta information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court on February 6, 2001, the charges in Alberta were already deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution. 3)The Saskatchewan information was sworn on March 29, 2001 and did not appear in Alberta. The matter was adjourned for hearing. 4)The court was unable to agree that an appearance by the respondent in a Saskatchewan court as a result of a summons issued before May 7, 2001 revived jurisdiction over the respondent. 5)The special plea agreement was not applicable in this case. 6)An appeal of the acquittals was not allowed. The Saskatchewan court had not lost jurisdiction and could have regained jurisdiction by following the procedure set out in s. 485.1 of the Code. The deemed dismissal did not preclude recommencing the proceedings in Saskatchewan. 7)Although jurisdiction was lost in Alberta, jurisdiction was regained in Saskatchewan when nothing happened in March/April 2001 and the subsequent appearance in May/September 2001. The provincial court judge was correct in concluding that the Alberta provincial court has lost jurisdiction.","The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process."
The Saskatoon Star-Post applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing. The applicant's journalists had no prior opportunity to hear the contents of the CD-RROM because the defendant entered a guilty plea. The Star-post was able to hear what it heard and edited out the audio and text summaries of more than 200 intercepted conversations. The Attorney General advised the applicant it must apply to the appropriate court with notice to the Crown for an order to obtain access. Both counsel agreed the appropriate courts were the Queen's Bench. The appropriate court was the Court of Queen'sBench.,"FIAT. Saskatoon's daily newspaper applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing in the matter of R. v. Glen Ivor Jones on May 14, 2002. The journalists had no prior opportunity to hear its contents because Jones entered a guilty plea. The application was not opposed. The applicant sought an order for mandamus or a declaration. HELD: The presumption is in favour of public access to court records and the burden to contrary proof lies with the person who would deny access. This right is tempered by other factors (see R. v. SJS). Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General and playing the CD ROM and making their own notes balances the interests of innocent parties whose conversations were recorded."
"FIAT. The defendant applied to have the plaintiff's lien vacated. The applicant brought an application to have it ordered to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The application was granted but the plaintiff was required to post security for cost. The plaintiff counterclaimed for $50k. The respondent indicated that he would consider it a step further by posting security for the costs of the counterclaim. HELD: The application for security for sufficiency of claims was dismissed and the order for costs was made in the lesser amount of money of $18,000 (the plaintiff was a non-resident). The court has discretion to order security for such costs where it is reasonably certain that the counter claim is not wholly distinct from the claim. The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily preclude an order for security but, in the circumstances of this case, it appears to be a factor which allows the court to do what is just and fair.","FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000. HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant."
The respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant. Belterra failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to be taxed as usual on the basis of double column 5 of the Court of Appeal Tariff of costs.,"The appellant appeal arguing that the respondent's conduct in soliciting the customers of the appellant constituted a breach of contract. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. Even if the respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, the appellant failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach. The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit. This loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did. As the trial judge found, the termination of the distributorship was unconnected to the respondent."
"HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittal set aside. The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. The evidence was excluded because the trial judge concluded that contrary to s. 8 of the Charter the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand and further, that pursuant to s24(2) the Charter, the admission of the certificate of analysis could bring the administration of justice in disrepute. A new trial must therefore be held and is ordered to ensure that the evidence does not rest on an error of a reasonable basis.","The accused was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08. The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated. The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand. HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation."
"The tenant appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer granting the landlord possession of her rental premises. This self-represented tenant included, as grounds of her appeal, 'procedural violations' and'misinformation as to the purpose of the hearing'. HELD: The tenants request an adjournment so that she can make arrangements to personally attend the hearing. 1)The hearing notice was properly served personally. The tenant did not appear. No notice or warning was needed.  2)The Hearing Officer, in accepting this 'boyfriend related evidence' when neither the Hearing Notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rules of natural justice and due process. The decision should be taken with a view to what is necessary to ensure that justice is done between the parties. The discretion must be exercised judicially by the application of proper legal principles. 3)The tenant's request for a long-desired adjournment was not properly considered by the hearing officer. The refusal of the tenant's application to have the evidence presented by the landlord and her fellow tenant, along with the fact that she was not personally present at the hearing, breached rules of procedural fairness and natural justice. 4)The refusal to properly consider and consider (a hearing notice or a written response to a landlord's claim as she knew it would be) was unreasonable and inconsistent with the principle of access to justice that must guide judges and administrative tribunals alike in the conduct of their hearings. 5)Both the hearing Notice and the Notice of Hearing in the particular circumstances of this case and the hearing notice sent to the rentalsman on the same working day prior to the hearing were completely disregarded. The Hearing Officer did not take the process very seriously and spent a considerable amount of time preparing a written reply. She did not ignore the process.","The tenant appeals the decision of the Hearing Officer granting her landlord a possession order of her rental premises. The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process. The reasonableness standard of review applies here."
"The testator had left his wife, the residue of his estate, when he died intestate. After his death, the wife, who had signed a separation agreement, applied for an interpretation of the will and separation agreement to determine whether a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounced a given gift after his death. The executrix of the estate applied for a review of the separation agreement and found that the gift to the deceased wife did not revoke the will; she was entitled to the gift under the will. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge relied on Billing, supra, Eccleston, et al., (2009), and the CanLII decision; the phrase 'to renounce and waive any claim in the estate of the other and any right to share in the other' is a supporting factor; the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed. However, he failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual pledge to renunciation, given only for consideration under the wife's will, binds someone to renouncing such an interest in something to which he or she has no legal interest.","A couple signed a separation agreement which included a provision whereby they agreed to renounce and waive any claim in the estate of the other and any right to share in the estate of the other, which terms were incorporated into a corollary relief judgment. When he died, the former husband had not changed his will, which left the residue of his estate to his former wife. The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift. The mother of the deceased appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed, the appellant had failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death. Even if the former spouse were so bound, there did not appear to be any privity of contract which would allow the appellant, who was not a party to the separation agreement, to enforce it."
"The accused was found guilty of several drug offences after police entered his home and searched his home without a warrant. The accused alleged that the police entry and search of his home were justified because the complainant did not know exactly where he lived and there were no weapons in the home. The evidence heard on his Charter application was considered in the trial proper along with additional evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; evidence found to be in breach of s. 8 Charter right against unreasonable search and seizure excluded; the evidence found as result of the searches should have been excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. Although the call was not a 911 call, it was reasonable for the police to search for the complainant and to go to the accused's home; not to simply leave once the complainant told them she was fine. The trial judge erred in principle by failing to consider alternatives short of police entry into the home and the search of the home, all without a search warrant. In the particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the residence, whether invited or not, and to search to ensure that there are no other occupants and to ensure he had no weapon. The record here was insufficient for the court, at first instance, to engage in a s.24(2)(a) analysis.","The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises."
"The applicant brought an application to vary paragraph 1(b) of the order of Wilson, J. She sought an order that the child was still child within the meaning of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. (2nd Supp.) and an order requiring ongoing and retroactive payments by the respondent for some of the child's extraordinary expenses for post-secondary education. The parties were unable to settle the sharing of the daughter's educational expenses for 2008/2009. HELD: 1) The respondent was ordered to pay $3,452.00 in full and complete satisfaction of any claim for retroactive child support for 2008-2009. 2) The amount of support payable by the father in accordance with the provisions of clause 3(2)(b) is rebuttable, having regard for the actual means and needs of the children and respective means of the parents. It is the petitioner's responsibility to fund her own education, particularly when it appears she did not apply herself to achieving some success. The burden is on the applicant to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence. 3) The applicant is responsible for two loans. These monies may be applied by the Johnson directly to her outstanding debts.","The petitioner brought an application to compel the respondent to pay his pro rata share of the costs for the child's post-secondary education expenses. The petitioner had previously been ordered to pay $1,000 in costs to the respondent but instead paid the $1,000 directly into the child's credit card balance and there was no evidence that this was done by mutual agreement between the parties. The child was not performing well in her program with no explanation for her poor performance. HELD The burden is on the petitioner to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence. Although the child is a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act during the time she was attending classes, her expenses are excessive. The child provided no evidence to rebut the respondent's information that she did not attend many of her classes. The child must take greater responsibility for her own expenses and debts if she does not apply herself to her studies. The respondent was ordered to match the amount paid by the petitioner towards the child's expenses. The costs owed by the petitioner to the respondent are set-off against the amount owing; the respondent shall pay $3,452 to the child's outstanding debts by or before February 15, 2011."
HELD: The appeal was allowed and the application to strike was dismissed. The court found that the order by the chamber judge striking major portions of the statement of defence and counterclaim was made in error. The error consisted of a failure to address the merits of the application brought by the applicant to strike the impugned portions of these pleadings.,"The appellants appealed the order of a Queen's Bench chamber's judge striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim. HELD: The chamber's judge was in error in striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application. The Court of Appeal opted to deal with the merits of the application themselves, rather than remitting the matter back to Queen's Bench. While the allegation of fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, the pleading is nevertheless sufficient to answer the requirements of QB Rule 173. The appellants should have been given an opportunity to amend their pleadings. The appeal was allowed and the application to strike was dismissed without prejudice to respondent's right to seek further particulars."
"The tenants appeal the decision of a hearing officer under s. 72 of The Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. They contend the hearing officer, who rendered her decision on May 31, 2012, committed several errors of law and seek to have the matter remitted back for re-hearing. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The decision of the hearing officers is set aside and the matter is remitted to the hearing office for a re- rehearing. The tenants sought to file affidavit evidence in support of their appeal. The court found the reasons inadequate to allow for meaningful review of the decision and for this matter remitt back to the Hearing Officer for rehearing on June 15. The tenant's application for possession was not formally before the hearing director at the same time as the landlord's application. While the tenants do not dispute that rent is owing, they contend an infestation of bed bugs in the residential premises has made it uninhabitable and forced them to incur personal expense to address this problem. The facts, they submit, should have been considered by the hearing hearing officer in the exercise of her 'just and equitable' discretion.","The tenants appealed a decision of a hearing officer under s. 72 of The Residential Tenancies Act. The hearing officer determined that the landlord's claim for non-payment of rent had been established and that an order for possession as warranted. The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent. The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem. They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs. However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient. The Court held that it was impossible to tell whether the hearing officer considered the tenants' evidence at the hearing, made findings of fact in that regard or whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in this situation. The reasons are inadequate to allow a meaningful review of the decision."
"The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies Hearing Officer in finding that the tenancy agreement was not a fixed-term agreement and that the landlord is legally disentitled to compensation pursuant to s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The wording of the lease indicates it is for a fixed term of one year from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013 and may thereafter be continued on a month to month basis. The fact that an indefinite term follows the fixed term is not reasonable within the meaning of that section and the landlord was legally disowned to compensate for that loss. 2) While the appellant gave evidence before the hearing officer that September was difficult time to rent the premise, the fact is he did not try because he decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting it. This decision was made not with respect to the possibilities of renting an unfurnished premises as of September 19, 2012 but was a macro decision based on his business going forward. None of this macro decision can be attributed to the respondent. 3) The hearing officer misinterpreted ss. 19(1)(g)(iii) of The Residential Tenancy Agreement and the 2006 Rules. The Hearing Officer erred in holding that the fact a month-to-month tenancy would follow the primary fixed term negated a fixed Term. The one-month notice provision referred to in the Term of the Lease was applicable only if the tenancy was extended to a Month to Month tenancy following the end of the fixedTerm. 4) The onus is on the defendant to establish a failure to mitigate on the part of the plaintiff.","The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer. The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant. The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss."
"The accused was charged with 14 counts of indecent assault and three counts of gross indecency against 14 individuals, all of whom were boys who attended the residential school between January 1, 1959 and December 31, 1967. The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys at the school. He developed the intermural hockey, competitive fastball and softball teams and the Beauval Warriors, which was the regional champion hockey team through most of the years. There were times when the relationship with various boys crossed the line from appropriate and acceptable behaviour to become acts of sexual assault and sexual interference. The Court was required to take into account the potential distraction of the trier of fact from its proper focus on the facts charged and the potential for undue time consumption.",HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of 10 counts and 7 counts were dismissed.
"The plaintiff landlord claims damages against its tenant, the defendant, asserting negligence by failing to clean, wax and polish the vinyl tile floor in the building, thereby permitting moisture to penetrate between and underneath the tiles resulting in lifting and cracking. The tenant also claims economic interference, alleging the landlord interfered with the sale of its restaurant. HELD: The tenant is awarded judgment against the landlord in the amount of $6,464 [$3,964 plus $2,500] in lieu of taxable costs. 1) The damage to the floor is $22,281 and the tenant is contributorily negligent to the extent of 25% of the damage. Leaking of water through the ceiling, sagging ceiling tiles, and deterioration of the floor tiles could be attributed to poor maintenance lack of sufficient polish and waxing. Although excessive moisture and high humidity within the building undermined the subfloor, causing instability and cracking of the vinyl floor tiles. 2) Moisture is 5 times in excess of standard reading for normal building samples and is due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor. 3) The evidence does show that a part, but only a small part, of the moisture entering into the building was due to negligent negligence. 4) The tenants are awarded costs for the three day trial of $1,500 inclusive of disbursements. 5) The tenant may set off the base monthly rent of $7,700 as specified in clause 8(b) of the lease.","HELD: The Court held that the cause of the damage was high humidity in the building caused by water leaking into it from the roof. The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800. Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836. The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500."
"Default judgment at case management was granted in the within matter December 1, 2014 against the defendants, Mario Di Battista and R-Rock. In the amount of $19,393.00, jointly and severally, R- Rock now sought to have the judgment set aside pursuant to s. 37(1) of the Small Claims Act, now in excess of 1 year from the granting of the judgment. HELD: The court directed that upon the return date argument be presented first as to whether the circumstances warrant consideration as an 'exceptional circumstance' permitting the application to proceed and whether on the merits the judgment ought to be set aside.","HELD: The defendant was ordered to present argument on the return date on whether the circumstances warranted consideration as an “exceptional circumstance” pursuant to s. 37(2) of the Act, to determine whether the application should proceed."
"Shareholders approved a plan of arrangement and sought an order approving that arrangement pursuant to s. 186.1 of the Business Corporations Act. The plan proposed liquidation and dissolution with a provision that if various shareholders of record cannot be found after outreach efforts, their pro rata entitlement to return of the corporation's capital will accrue to and be paid to the remaining known shareholders. The applicant argued the court has the power to approve such an arrangement under the powers given to it under ss.186.1(4), 203(8) and 210(m) of the Act. HELD: The court adopted an interpretation that was appropriate. The proposal of the applicant was not being used by the applicant for a purpose which the legislature did not intend. The court could exercise its power under s.210(l) while comply with the mandatory direction in s.220(1). The court found no conflict between the power given to the court in s.(l) and s.(m) to override the mandatory directions contained in ss.220 and 221 and s. 210(1) in the context of liquidation or dissolution of a corporation. The purpose of the application was to allow the court to approve a proposed distribution to shareholders of their entitlement, qua shareholders, either in the form of money or property, in a fashion consistent with the broad purpose and intent set forth in the Act within Divisions XIV and XVI.","HELD: The court held that it did not have the power to approve the proposed plan of arrangement. The court applied the rules of statutory interpretation, specifically the presumption of coherence and overlap, to the provisions of the Act and found that the applicant was using s. 186.1 for a purpose that the legislature did not intend. The applicant could have proceeded to dissolution under Division XVI. In s. 210(m) the legislature intended to give the court the ability to order disposition of property of creditors and shareholders but not to deal with a shareholder’s right to distribution on dissolution."
HELD: The Court found that the parties were persons of sufficient interest regarding the child pursuant to s. 23(1)(a) of The Child and Family Services Act and that an indefinite order of protection was appropriate. The Ministry’s position was that the parents had been unable and unwilling to provide the minimum level of parenting required for the child to his needs and that this failure was likely to cause them physical and/or emotional harm. The Court ordered that the child be committed to the care of the parents for an indefinite period of time.,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order committing a two-year-old child to the care of his maternal grandparents for an indefinite period of time. The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest. The child had lived with them since birth. The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change. These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother."
"The accused was charged with angling for and consuming fish in waters closed to the public pursuant to s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995. The issue before the Court was whether the accused was bound by s.7 of the Regulations, made pursuant to the Fisheries Act, 1995 and whether the regulation violated his Treaty right to fish for sustenance/food. HELD: The accused was granted a stay of the charge. 1)The evidence presented was that the accused, as a Treaty Indian, was fishing for food in a location close to the mouth of the Canoe Lake Lake, and therefore within the purview and discussion of the members of the band, the proposed closure was a conservation measure in and of itself not an infringement on the Treaty right. 2)Although the accused had no claim to the actus reus of the substantial charge, his evidence was uncontradicted by any defence evidence. His evidence was found to rest on his claim that the regulations were not in breach of his Treaty rights. 3)The only document from the Saskatchewan Ministry of the Environment giving evidence on the validity of the regulations was a letter from the respondent corporation that was never located by the Court.","/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry. The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone."
"HELD: The Court held that an amendment to an information expanding the time particulars of the offence could be made at trial based upon evidence that indicates the offence may have been committed within the amended timeframe. Since the evidence was to the effect that marijuana plants did not start arriving until early June, grant amendment of the indictment to cover the period March 1, 2016 to September 15, 2016. The Court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused were unlawfully producing cannabis and possessed the cannabis for the purposes of trafficking; based on the totality of the evidence, the only rational conclusion to be drawn in respect of the cash found in their residence was that it was property obtained by the commission of an indictable offence in Canada.","HELD: The accused were each acquitted of all charges. The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation. The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him. Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G. The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer."
"HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 236(a) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46 and his guilty plea to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so.  1) The sentencing principles outlined in s. 743.6 of the Code apply to this case.  2) The accused has an extensive criminal record including 57 prior convictions of which are for violent offences. He has shown no remorse since he in drunken stupor shot his cousin in the head for no apparent reason. 3) Although the Crown provided the Court with multiple cases, the Crown was relying primarily upon three cases which the Court reviewed in support of its request for a 15 year global sentence with no parole eligibility until Gordon had served half of that sentence pursuant to the s.743.8 order. The Court found that a global sentence of 10 years is appropriate in this case to be served in a federal penitentiary on the manslaughter conviction.","HELD: The court sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 10 years for the manslaughter conviction. A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence."
"The plaintiffs sought damages for mental distress following an aborted real estate transaction. The defendants had failed to complete the purchase of the condominium. The plaintiffs, under the guidance of their solicitor, obtained an order striking out the defendants' defence and entering summary judgment against the defendants with the plaintiffs' damages to be assessed. The plaintiff claimed damages for depression, anxiety and psychological distress following the failure of the defendants to complete their transaction. For the plaintiffs, that the defendants had been totally irresponsible in allowing the plaintiff's conduct to succeed. Awarding the plaintiff $3,500, $1,000, and $5,000 for mental anguish, that these damages could have been avoided had the defendants not taken advantage of their substantial equity in the company and, in addition, given that the plaintiff had already secured financing from the bank which would have allowed her to purchase the condo, they were not able to repay the mortgage on the condo. Further, the plaintiff suffered significant damages for emotional distress resulting from the failed sale of the house. The court found that the plaintiffs had made all reasonable and reasonable efforts to minimize the damage caused to the plaintiff and her family.","The plaintiff vendors claimed damages for mental distress following an aborted real estate transaction. The breach of contract by the defendant purchasers had a domino effect as the plaintiffs had intended to buy a condominium and were sued by their intended vendor, who in turn was a party to a contingent real estate transaction. When the transaction fell apart, the female plaintiff broke down and needed medical treatment. For the plaintiffs and awarding aggravated damages in the amount of $1,000 to the male plaintiff for frustration/hardship and $5,000 to the female plaintiff for mental distress/follow up treatment. The court distinguished between punitive and aggravated damages and noted that the defendants' breach of contract did not have to be 'wanton or reckless' for the plaintiffs' claim in mental distress to succeed. These damages arose naturally from the breach and were foreseeable at the time the contract was executed."
"The plaintiff sought an order under the Partition Act for the partition and sale of two properties owned jointly by the parties, a declaration of ownership regarding personal property and a division of other property owned by the defendant based on a constructive trust. The parties cohabited for approximately twelve years. The plaintiff was the owner of a mobile home and her three children from a prior marriage lived in it. For the twelve years between 1975 and 1988, the plaintiff earned $17,409.95 per year. Her income diminished due to reduced hours worked and in 1986 she stopped her employment altogether. Her average earnings over the years were $10,162.95. The constructive trust was found to have met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment including that the contribution was sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to an interest in the property and that the defendant was chargeable as a constructive trustee. Awarding the plaintiff $800.00 per month in arrears, that this sum should be accounted for in the amount of $12,000.00. It was found that the plaintiff's contributions to the business of the parties did not constitute unjust enrichment.","The parties lived together for some 12 years before separating in 1988. The plaintiff was 53 and the defendant 60. The plaintiff sought an order under the Partition Act for the partition and sale of two properties owned jointly and a division of property owned by the defendant based on a constructive trust. The defendant owned and operated residential rental properties. The plaintiff, who had stopped working as a medical records technician in 1988, maintained the household and assisted in the business by answering phones, bookkeeping, showing apartments and helping with minor repairs. (1) that the plaintiff met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment by virtue of the plaintiff's contributions of time and money, namely (a) an enrichment, (b) a corresponding deprivation, and (c) the absence of any juristic reason for the enrichment. The proper remedy was an award of monetary damages representing 25% of the increase in the value of the defendant's assets during the relationship, not the imposition of a constructive trust; and (2) jointly held properties were to be sold pursuant to the Partition Act, unless the plaintiff elected to buy out the defendant's one half interest within 30 days. Prejudgment interest was calculated from the date of separation to September 1, 1991, at 10% per year."
"Three issues arising from the breakdown of a 4 1/2 year marriage: the date spousal support should terminate, the value of property in British Columbia and whether the wife's student loan was a matrimonial debt. HELD: The husband's obligation to support the wife should end; $700.00 per month ordered for another year. The wife's obligation should end on November 30, 1995. 1)The court was unwilling to impose costs on the wife. 2)The respondent was entitled to an exemption for an amount of $900 per month pursuant to s. 23 of the Matrimonial Property Act. 3)It was necessary to promote the economic self sufficiency of each spouse within reasonable period of time.","The parties applied to the Court to resolve the issues of spousal support and a division of the matrimonial property. The parties had been married 4 years. There were no children of the marriage. The Wife had a university education but was unemployed. She had already received interim support in the amount of $1,500.00 per month for 1 year. HELD: 1)The support order was terminated effective November 30, 1995. 2)The Court determined the value of a resort property owned by the Husband in BC and permitted an exemption for its value as at the date of marriage. 3)The Court refused to permit the Wife to subtract from the value of her assets, the amount owing on a student loan which pre-dated the marriage. 4)With the exception of those items already discussed, the Court divided the value of the matrimonial property equally."
"The sole issue before me was whether it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual assaults alleged occurred on or after October 22, 1986, the date that the accused became an adult. The case had not yet come to a Youth Court transfer and a concurrent proceeding was pending in Youth Court. HELD: 1)The accused was acquitted of the charge in theindictment. His evidence was clear that he had attempted to have sexual intercourse with the complainant when she was or 9 but that he subsequently moved from the Beardy's Indian Reserve to Prince Albert while he was still a young person and had no further contact with her. Although the one or two incidents of improper touching took place after the sexual intercourse incident, she quite frankly admitted that he sexually assaulted her when she turned 10 and was almost 11 on the first date specified in the indictment.  2)The Court of Queen's Bench accordingly had jurisdiction only when a matter is transferred to it pursuant to s.6 of the Young Offenders Act.",The accused was charged with sexual assault and was tried in the Court of Queen's Bench. The evidence at trial indicated that the alleged acts had occurred prior to the accused becoming an adult. He had not been ordered transferred into adult court under s.16 of The Young Offenders Act. HELD: Accused acquitted. 1)The Judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had sexually assaulted the complainant. 2)Because the complainant's evidence suggested that the assault occurred while the accused was a young offender the Judge concluded that the Court of Queen's Bench was without jurisdiction in the matter.
"The applicant applied for an order pursuant to s14 of the Attachment of Debts Act paying out to her certain monies paid into court by the Royal Bank of Canada and by Martindale Holdings Ltd. plus the interest thereon. The respondent was personally served with a garnishee summons but did not appear. The applicant obtained judgment against the respondent May 11, 1987 in the Court of Queen's Bench for Alberta in the sum of $11,634.74. Sokulski, the respondent's DEFENDANT applied to have the judgment set aside and if no appeal is taken, the funds, including any accrued interest, will be paid to each of the defendants. HELD: The Court made no order as to costs as this chambers application would have been unnecessary had the proper procedures been followed in the first instance.  1)The Chambers judge exercised his discretion to set aside the judgment obtained against the non-appearing garnishees.  2)The Court was also satisfied that the deficiencies in the procedure were addressed. 3)The chambers judge did not allow the payment of the monies by the plaintiff to be resisted. If the plaintiff had resisted this Chambers judge's application in its own discretion he would have directed that monies be paid out to the plaintiff. 4)The judgment was set aside.","The Plaintiff applied for payment out of certain monies paid into court in response to 3 garnishee summons served on 2 garnishees after judgment. The first summons was never served on the Defendant. Of the other 2, only 1 was served on the Defendant. Further, although 1 garnishee was only served twice, it paid monies into court on 5 occasions. There was no application to set aside any of the garnishee summons' by the Defendant and he did not appear on this application. HELD: Application allowed. 1)The court has an inherent power to control its own process in garnishment proceedings. 2)The court also has the discretion to order the payment of the money to the plaintiff as a judgment creditor. 3)The chambers judge ordered that the monies held in court to the credit of this cause be paid to the plaintiff, but made no order as to costs."
"The appellant sought to strike the respondent's Originating Notice and Statement of Claim. He argued that the chambers judge erred in that he did not have jurisdiction to review the s. 38 Order but, when he did, acted with bias in his handling of the application. Dismissing the appeal, that the Chambers judge properly considered the admissible and relevant evidence before him. The order in this case is not analogous to the situation before us. In B.N.R. the Chambers Judge was granted jurisdiction to Review the Order, which was not binding upon the defendant. The judge reviewed the record to the extent necessary and determined that the respondents were creditors. He did not allow the appellant's application to challenge the finding of fact by Palmeter, A.C.J. that, for the purposes of the action, the respondents are creditors. The appellant's argument that the Chamber judge was biased in his granting of the Order was dismissed. There was nothing in the extensive record before the Court to indicate that the judge acted other than in an impartial and fair manner in considering the application by the appellant.","The respondents were granted an order by a Chambers judge pursuant to s. 38(1) of the Bankruptcy Act which authorized them to commence a fraud action against the appellant, a bankrupt. In making his ruling, the Chambers judge found that the respondents were creditors of the bankrupt estate for the purposes of s. 38(1). The respondents subsequently commenced an action against the appellant. The appellant applied to the judge assigned to oversee the case management of the action for an order striking the Statement of Claim on the basis that the respondents were not creditors of the bankrupt estate and, therefore, should not have been granted the order authorizing the commencement of the action. The case management judge held that he did not have the jurisdiction to inquire into the merit of the s. 38 order. He dismissed the action. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that the case management judge did not err. The appellant could not collaterally attack the s. 38 order by challenging a factual finding made in the granting of the order."
"The appellant appealed the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration in the grievance of Lavern Chypiska. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no material error in the analysis of the words in Article 16 in the context of the whole agreement. The Chambers judge was of the view that the majority had brushed aside basic grammatical conventions, proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the appellant, and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions, including alterations wrought by changing the ordinary meaning of any words in the course of interpreting its provisions.","The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions. She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation. Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges."
"FIAT. The parties negotiated settlement of all of the outstanding issues including divorce, custody of the children, division of matrimonial property and spousal support payable by the husband to the applicant. The wife counter-petitioned in March 1993 and included in her claim a Lump sum and periodic spousals support. The matter proceeded from there and it was apparent that the parties were aware of the nature and effect of the Interspousal Contract and each had independent legal advice before the agreement was signed. Subsequently the clause with respect to spousAL support was incorporated into the judgment of the Court which was dated November 26, 1993. The applicant is seeking costs of the application. HELD: While the income of the applicant has dropped, the respondent's counsel that she has not established that she cannot be self-sufficient has been concluded. The agreement in the Gessner case was intended to be final and in light of those conclusions, the Court has no alternative but to dismiss the application. While it is true that the applicant's income has dropped I agree with her counsel that her position has not been made out. During at least some of the years since the separation she has been very self- sufficient and if she has fallen upon hard days of late, while it is regrettable, the terms of the agreement which limited the payment of spousol support to the 31st of December 1995 appear applicable. There is no suggestion that the Agreement was unfairly negotiated or that she was subject to undue influence or pressure in any way before signing the agreement and was in fact advised by counsel before doing so.","FIAT. The parties were married in 1973 and separated in 1992. The husband petitioned for divorce and corollary relief in 1992. The wife counter-petitioned in 1993 claiming a 'lump sum and periodic spousal support'. An interspousal contract entered into 1993 provided for periodic monthly spousal support of $350. Both acknowledged that they were aware of the nature and effect of the agreement and each had independent legal advice before signing. The husband paid periodic spousal support until December 1995. The applicant sought to vary the 1993 order on the grounds there had been a change in circumstances in that her annual income was currently less than half of what it had been at the time the order was made and her economic hardship could be traced to the breakdown of her marriage primarily because his job had required them to move from place to place during the marriage. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The agreement was intended to be final. While the applicant's income had dropped she had not established that she could not be self-sufficient. The terms of the agreement which limited the payment of spousal support to December 1995 appeared to be applicable. The applicant had previously brought a similar variation application even though she earned in excess of $25,000 in 1995. 2)There was no suggestion that the agreement was unfairly negotiated or that she was subjected to undue influence or pressure in any way prior to signing and she had been advised by counsel.  3)Costs sought by the respondent were refused."
"The appellant appealed an order entered in Queen's Bench on October 15, 1998 dismissing the motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim for insurance premiums payable by the plaintiff under the hail insurance contract in question. Although the plaintiff's claim is fixed at $3,373.50 being the amount of an appraisal award, the respondent challenges the validity of this appraisal award purporting to be made under The Saskatchewan Insurance Act and the statutory conditions that govern such appraisals. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part. The appellant had satisfied the criteria in Bombardier Credit v. Kostuchuk et al., 1994 CanLII 3870 and was entitled to judgment for $10,870 with interest at the rate of 10% as stipulated in the promissory note, plus costs in Queen Bench on the applicable tariff and costs in this Court on single column 5 and the appellant's prayer for relief in its motion was amended to claim the full amount of the premiums payable. There were a number of 'housekeeping' items that must be addressed in order to facilitate the orderly disposition of the action.The appellant was granted leave to amend its statement of defence to the plaintiffs claim by pleading the relevant statutory conditions in the Saskatchewan insurance act, together with any additional material facts pertaining to that defence. It was given leave to plead to any new matters in the respondent's amended statement of claim.","The insurer appealed the October 1998 order which dismissed the appellant's motion for dismissal of the insured's action and for summary judgment on its counterclaim for insurance premiums payable under the hail insurance contract. The insured had signed a promissory note and tendered a cheque payable in September 1996 but stopped payment and advanced a claim of set-off. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part under Rule 129 without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to proceed for the alleged loss of $38,585. 1)The appellant was granted leave to amend its statement of defence by pleading the relevant statutory conditions in the Saskatchewan Insurance Act and any additional material facts and new matters raised by the amended statement of claim. The plaintiff was granted leave to reply. Each party was permitted to re-open the examinations for discovery. 2)The insured had no defence to the counterclaim for premiums which was a separate action. The prayer for relief was amended to claim the full amount of the premiums which were payable with interest at the rate of 10% as stipulated in the promissory note together with costs on the applicable tariff in Queen's Bench and in the Court of Appeal on single column 5."
"FIAT. The divorced husband applied to vary the spousal support provisions contained in a separation agreement dated June 18, 1975. By virtue of paragraph 4(a) of the agreement the parties agreed the initial sum of $550 would be paid for in 1959. Although this was unilaterally reduced in 1995 it was subsequently increased to $627.55 per month after the wife remarried or died in whichever date the sooner. The application was dismissed with costs to the husband. The modest income of the respondent indicates that the agreement clearly stated that there would be a complete, final and effective settlement of their respective rights. The retirement of the applicant and the reduction of his income as a consequence is or was reasonably foreseeable at the time the agreement was entered into. The fact it had occurred is not that kind of radical unforseen change in circumstance required to be established upon the authorities to support the variation application. Nor am I persuaded that the respondent's modest income provides any proper ground for variation of the agreements. She still had a much lower standard of living than the applicant even after taking into account the amount she is receiving as spouse support.","FIAT. The husband seeks to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' 1975 separation agreement. This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first. The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years. The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income. In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement. At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent. The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income. This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support. The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement. The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent. The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support."
"The plaintiff was a party to a mortgage foreclosure commenced against the defendants. The defendants had planned to insure the mortgage with the federal government through its mortgage insurance program and retained the services of a Kentville lawyer. The mortgage fell into arrears during construction of the apartment complex and the defendants made an application for further disclosure. The plaintiff counterclaimed for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and for negligence. The defendant defended the action on various grounds and counterclaimed against the plaintiff, alleging that the defendants had induced him to take certain steps in reliance on the plaintiff's advice on legal matters. At trial, the defendants were ordered to make full disclosure. At the discovery, the plaintiff submitted that all of the documents sought, and indeed all of Muttart's evidence, ought to be excluded on the basis that it is subject to solicitor-client privilege.HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the plaintiff had waived the privilege and that it was reasonably inferred that the defendant had in fact made voluntary disclosure or consented to disclosure of any material part of the communication. There were no exceptional circumstances which would justify granting the necessary leave to obtain the documents. The state of mind exception to solicitor and client privilege was examined carefully and exhaustively in Lloyds Bank Canada v. Canada Life and Christmas. The documents sought appeared before the Associate Chief Justice at an appearance day and were to be produced within two months. The examination was to proceed on a question-and-a-half basis and apparently would be subject to specific objections by the plaintiff. The discovery proceeded without objection. In this factual situation, the waiver may be reasonably inferred.","The borrower in a mortgage foreclosure action counterclaimed against the lender and joined the insurer of the mortgage and experts he had retained for advice in the development on the basis of negligent misrepresentation. During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate. No privilege was claimed during the discovery process. The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs. Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver. There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance."
"This was an application by the Provincial Director pursuant to s. 98 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act for continuation of the custody portion of a custody and supervision sentence made under s. 42(2)(n). The Young Person was 18 years old when he appeared on the application. He had served 180 days in custody and had only 90 days remaining for the community supervision portion. The issue was whether the young person was likely to commit a serious violent offence before the expiry of the youth sentence. HELD: The application was allowed to proceed. The matter was adjourned for a hearing. The court was required to determine whether there were compelling reasons to keep the Young Person in custody. It would seem that an application to continue custody would be a marked departure, procedurally, from our previous experience under the Young Offenders Act. Although the new Act has been in place for over months, this was the first experience with an application of this nature in Saskatoon.","The Provincial Director applied pursuant to s. 98 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act for continuance of the custody portion of a custody and supervision sentence made pursuant to s. 42(2)(n). The Provincial Director was concerned that, because S.T.T. had not followed through with his treatment, he was at a high risk to offend again. HELD: The application lacked compelling reasons to keep the young person in custody.  1) This was the first experience with an application of this nature in Saskatoon and the Court provided a detailed discussion of the procedure for the benefit of future applications. 2) The application was not brought in a reasonable time having regard to all of the circumstances. The young person must be put on notice that the application is being made. 3) The Review (Progress) Report is a form of disclosure for the young person and should be available well in advance of the hearing."
"Following the completion of the plaintiff's civil trial by judge and jury, counsel for the defendants presented a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A. The rule provides that the defendant may without being called upon to elect whether he will call evidence, move for dismissal of the action. HELD: The application is dismissed and the defendant is entitled to one set of costs only against the plaintiff, the same to be taxed pursuant to column unless any other provisions of the rules with respect to offers of settlement are applicable. 1) There is no expert evidence presented by the plaintiff to the jury to provide the jury with the competence to reach a conclusion on the second most fundamental issue of the case, which is whether the standard of care that is applicable in a professional negligence case is breached. 2) The calling of a legal expert to provide opinion evidence is not a matter of convenience or choice for the plaintiff. The jury has no evidence upon which they could possibly render a competent verdict upon the disparate facts relied upon by the plaintiffs in the evidence that she and her husband gave at the trial. 3) The plaintiff's claim and the evidence she did present at this trial dealt with the very complicated issue of whether the duty of care owed and the breach of that duty by the defendant lawyers in respect of the preparation for and conduct of plaintiff's trial in what is known as a prosecution for quasi-criminal statutory offence(s) (Ries Estate). The issues raised involve substantial legal expertise and judgment including knowledge of the legal rules of admissibility respecting the evidence of witnesses, the identification of legal issues likely to be raised at trial, the appropriate strategy to address those legal issues and the judgments and decisions taken in pursuit of that strategy all are complex and important professional judgments to be made by the trial lawyer.  4) The court was awarded its costs of the motion in the context of column V. The court recognized the importance of calling expert evidence at trial where the issue is a matter beyond the ordinary competence of a trier of fact to decide, in that case, the trial judge's responsibility to decide.","The plaintiff brought a professional negligence claim against her former solicitors with respect to their handling of three charges against her for practising medicine without a licence and one charge for providing medical treatment, while not registered under the Medical Professions Act. The solicitors brought a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A. HELD: The motion for a non-suit was granted. The claim was dismissed. Although given an opportunity, the plaintiff failed to call expert evidence respecting the elements of negligence including the duty of care, standard of care, breach of the duty of care or causation. The solicitors were awarded one set of costs taxed on column 4."
"The Court presented with a form of a consent judgment bearing the consents of the two parties. At first blush, it might assume the parties would jointly be seeking relief, but the terms of the proposed judgment were unconscionable. There had not been equality in the bargaining positions of the parties and the petitioner had chosen not to seek legal counsel and advice. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs of the application and the court's own costs of filing the material on her own behalf. The Court could not urge the petitioner to seek advice and assistance from outside counsel but could urge her to seek it out. There was no equality in bargaining positions between the petitioner and the respondent. When the parties came to the Court requesting the proposed form of consent judgment, the terms appeared to be patently unfair or unconscionsable to one of them and the Court must not be seen to legitimatize, condone, condone or acquiesce in acquiescing in the acquiescing acquiescence of the petitioner into the agreement. The proposed consent judgment was clearly improvident. The parties did not need Court order nor judgment to attain their apparent goals. They were content to proceed with this arrangement without the formality of a judgment or contract. The petitioner's obligation to provide child support would be $88 per month. The 18 year old child would be 18 years old in approximately 18 months time. The economic value of releasing the petitioner from her obligation to pay child support may be less than $1,600 in all. No reasonable person would conclude that the proposal was anything but unconscioable and would speculate that at some point in the future, she will come to realize how much she was indebted to the petitioner. The court ordered the use of legal advice and guidance.","The Court was presented with a consent judgment. The respondent was unrepresented. The Court found the terms of the consent judgment were so unfair as to be unconscionable. HELD: The Court refused to issue the order on the grounds that the Court must not be seen as legitimatizing, condoning, acquiescing or approving of an unconscionable bargain."
"The respondent received an investigation order for the investigation of the trading in the securities of Knowledge House, a company of which the respondent is President, CEO and Chair. The respondent applied to the Court for certiorari to quash the investigation and for an order to return all of the emails that had been obtained. The chambers judge essentially granted the respondent's application and dismissed the Commission's's's appeal. The Commission argued that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and that, as a result, the procedural orders under appeal should not have been made. It followed that the chambers judge did not allow the Commission the opportunity to rule on this point before the issue of privilege was resolved. The application for a stay of the judicial review was dismissed. The court reviewed the history of judicial review applications and found that judicial review is the only mechanism to resolve issues of solicitor-client privilege. There is no express language and no clear legislative intention in s. 29A to take away the inherent authority of the superior court to order production. The principles of deliberative secrecy and the exercise of discretion on the part of the Commission are at the heart of the regulatory system established by the Act. The balance between confidentiality and disclosure within that process is one that is critical to the effective discharge of the commission's mandate. While there are many administrative and practical issues to be addressed, the commission is in the best position and has the statutory discretion to address the issues of discovery.","The president of a company against whom the Securities Commission had ordered an investigation applied to the court for certiorari to quash the investigation. He alleged that the investigators had improperly obtained and used the contents of his email, some of which were subject to solicitor and client privilege. In the context of the certiorari application, the company president successfully argued that the Commission's return should contain the fruits of the investigation so far and that he should be entitled to examine one of the investigators for discovery. The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made. Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints. The decision as to whether or not to release the information sought required the balancing of competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case; the Commission was in the best position to conduct such an exercise."
"The defendant was convicted of unlawfully furnish a tobacco product to a young person contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act. The defendant appealed the conviction on the following grounds: the trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case; failing to apply the doctrine of stare decisis; and the verdict was unreasonable by being inconsistent with the acquittal of the appellant in the case of R. v. Westfair Foods Ltd. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was quashed, the sentence was vacated and an acquittal entered. 1) The trial judge correctly set out the state of the law surrounding the defence of diligence in this case. He was required to consider what a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances to avoid this offence. A reasonable person is not required to possess extraordinary or great diligence or to exercise extreme care that a person of unusual prudence would apply. The system implemented by Westfair in R. vs. Friesen to prevent the sale of tobacco to minors was essentially the same as the procedure followed by the other defendant. 2) The evidence tendered at the trial suggests that prior to the incident on August 25, 2003, before the incident, Westfair had an established system created to prevent its cashiers from selling cigarettes to minors. This standard exceeds the requirements of reasonable person.  3) By applying a higher standard of Due diligence, the defendant would have succeeded in establishing the defence for due diligence as was decided in R.' v. W.Fair Foods Ltd.(1992), 138 C.C.C.(3d) 68 (Ont. Prov. Ct.) held at p. 77. To demand more, would move a strict liability offence dangerously close to one of absolute liability.","The appellant appeals its conviction of selling tobacco to a minor contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act. The appellant argues that the learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is entered.  1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place. 2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence. The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law. Had the appropriate standard of due diligence been applied to the facts of this case, the appellant would have succeeded."
"The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit from the respondent, developer. It was the only planned unit of its kind in the warehouse the developer proposed to convert to a 26 unit condominium. The developer decided not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it instead to a single story unit (Unit 5). The appellant registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land on which the land stood. The respondent later sold the unit to third party purchaser. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property' as there was no evidence that the respondent filed a statement of defence at the time it made the application and the issues lacked refinement. The determination of appropriate remedies was premature at that stage of proceedings.","The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer. The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent."
"The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. (Chisum), was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1. The accused admitted to consuming aspen logs for the log home industry. The logs were cut to length and then loaded onto semi-truck. The defence argued that the logs were from the forest and were from logs that could be used in log homes. The issue in this case was whether the Crown has shown that the Crown requires a Forestry Product Processing Facility Licence. HELD: The requirement for processing facility licence was restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures forest product. The creation of a chisum log is processing and must require a processing licence. The process used by the Chisums was more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. It is further supported by the fact that the process detailed in P-1 encompassed the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs that were used in the construction of log home. The logging process was not an insignificant process, nor is it process removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest land.","The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act."
"The Ministry of Social Services sought an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoption. The boys were apprehended from the care of their maternal grandparents, A.H. and Laura. Art and Laura oppose the application and petition the Court to return their grandsons to their care. HELD: The Court found that the boys had been placed with the MSS for a period of time and that it was incumbent upon the court to determine whether the children should be returned to parent, placed with a person of sufficient interest or with the Minister for a temporary period. The Court concluded that the Stevens home met the necessary physical requirements to properly care for the children such that they would not pose a risk to the children. 1) After working through the Criminal Code convictions and the photography business, the balance of the Court's testimony focussed on his relationship with the boys. He admitted that he masturbated in the home with the door open. He acknowledged that the home had a somewhat unorthodox feel to it. The physical plant of the home must present some challenges. However, the physical plant was generally okay. The children appeared to be doing well at school and playing with their friends. The parents' relationship with their children was fostered by their children. 2) The MSS had determined that they did not regard the boys as good resource for them. They were ordered to forthwith transfer the boys to their parents. 3) The Court ordered the permanent placement of the boys in the custody of the Minister until the age of 18.","The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption. Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care. The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody. HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility."
"The mother has filed a motion requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the 2008 order. As the Gunn J order is premised on the child, Adam, residing with the mother and the child David, residing in the father's home, have no longer resided with either parent. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. The capital gain is a non-reoccurring amount which should not be included in the determination of the father’s 2008 income. HELD: With respect to the capital gain shown on the father, it is clear that the father will not earn the sum of $270,000 in the 2009 taxation year. The father has only one source of income, being his new employment position. It would be unfair to have the father continue to provide support on the basis of an income in the sum that is not quite what he is receiving. The parties agreed in 2008 that the parties would base support for the children on the actual guideline income for the father. The fact that the mother spent his severance funds on legal fees and to set up his new home in Alberta is irrelevant. The severance is included as part of the dad’S income.","FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600."
"The accused, who was charged with a variety of offences, was found unfit to stand trial pursuant to s. 672.23 of the Criminal Code. The Court found that he had at least some recollection of the events, but there was not any possibility that he would be able to participate in a meaningful way. Based on the evidence of the witnesses, and the Court's assessment of his ability to communicate with and instruct counsel, and in particular, to comprehend the nature of the proceedings and its possible consequences, the accused was found to be incapable of participating meaningfully in the trial.","The accused was subject to a hearing to determine whether he was fit to stand trial on charges under the Criminal Code. The accused was grossly lacking in mental abilities, had limited and basic comprehension, had the mental capacity of a young child and these facts were not likely to change anytime soon. The accused had extreme difficulty paying attention to the court proceedings and appeared incapable of doing so. He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD: The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability. The accused said that his lawyer was the judge, could not answer when asked what the judge's role was and he had limited insight into why he was in Court. The accused met the portion of the limited cognitive capacity test which requires an understanding of the nature of the proceedings and their possible consequences and the accused is capable of communicating his version of the events surrounding the allegations, but there is no possibility he could participate in a meaningful way in the trial. According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence. The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding."
"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order from the Court of Appeal requiring the legal office of Eggum, Abrametz and Eggum to produce to the sheriff of the Judicial Centre of Prince Albert, the shares owned by Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co. Ltd. pursuant to the June 5, 2001 writ of execution. HELD: 1) The solicitor's lien arises out of s. 66(3) of The Legal Profession Act. The solicitor has no rights greater than those of the client. He owns the shares. They cannot be subsumed to the company and thus become liable to a solicitor’s lien as being part of the records of the company. The claim for lien is not made out. 2) The court found that the evidence before the court did not allow it to determine the amount owing by Jensen for legal work done for it. Given the totality of the evidence, the Court did not consider a valid solicitor lien to have been raised. 3) The application to compel the sheriff to produce the shares by mail is dismissed. 4) The sheriff has the power to seize shares pursuant to The Executions Act.  5) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure of a piece of farm land. The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act has an application pursuant to s. 21(1) of the Legal Profession act to seize the shares of a company owned by the applicant. The applicant has no right to refuse production and delivery of documents on which a solicitor has lien. The argument that the receiver cannot have rights greater then those of a client cannot be sustained. The claims for a lien cannot be made out based on the uncontroverted affidavit of the respondent. 6) The applicant is entitled to costs of this application.",A judgment issued from the Court along with a writ of execution. The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.
"The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: possession of a controlled substance for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act; unlawfully possessing property (or proceeds of property), knowing that all of the property was obtained (or derived directly or indirectly) as a result of the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to section 354 and 355(a). The accused had nine prior drug convictions since his arrest, two for trafficking and one conspiracy to traffic which resulted him receiving a sentence of 5 years in the penitentiary; his pre-trial detention was in part the result of a failed preliminary hearing which saw the prosecutor unable to reach Estevan. The court accepted the accused's deposition that he was a compliant prisoner, had no disciplinary issues or problems while on remand and that he would have qualified, had he been in the regular prison population, for a one-third reduction in his sentence for the current offences. The Court gave the accused credit for one and one-half days for each day he spent in custody for the past three and a half years, the same to be served unless otherwise permitted at a provincial correctional centre in Saskatchewan. The accused was ordered to pay a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,325.98 to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the sentence of imprisonment imposed by this judgment is ordered.","The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code. At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed."
"HELD: The plaintiffs claim their damages are set off against the claim of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs acknowledge they owe the defendant for the removal of a bedroom wall. The defendant denies his workmanship was poor, that he was not allowed to finish the job, and that his tools remained at the plaintiffs' home for several months after he was terminated. The plaintiff counterclaims for the cost of the work, service, postage, photographs, witness fees, mileage and parking to attend court and compensation for lost use of tools. 1) The plaintiffs were awarded judgment against the defendant in the amount of $3,342.00 for Mr. Harder's unpaid work.  2) In the circumstances, the counterclaim of the defendant is set off, the plaintiffs are awarded $6,292.54. 3) In this case, the defendant's conduct constituted a breach of the contract and negligence, there is nothing to suggest it was malicious, oppressive or high-handed, such that punitive damages are rationally required to punish or deter. The objective of punitive damages is to punish the defendant rather than compensate plaintiff, whose just compensation will already have been assessed. The court found the defendant to be guilty of breach of contract, negligence in that the plaintiff's actions did not constitute breach of duty of care owed to them by the defendant.","The plaintiffs hired the defendant to perform renovations to their home. The plaintiffs terminated the contract believing the defendant's workmanship was poor and that he caused some damage to their home and created a mess. The plaintiffs sued the defendant alleging damages. The defendant counterclaimed the cost of the work completed but for which he was not paid and compensation for the lost use of his tools. HELD: The Court granted judgment for damages in the amount of $3,822 for necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning expenses and granted the counter-claim in the amount of $580 for unpaid work performed by the defendant and then applied setoff. The Court allowed the cost of issuing the claim and for reasonable cost of service."
"FIAT: The applicant brings an application to strike the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution or compel the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Mutual Insurance. HELD: 1) The delay from June 2010 to May 2012 really is a delay from May 2011 until May 2012 and solely on the head of counsel for the plaintiff for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. While one year is an excessive period of time it is not at such an early stage that it would lead the Court on its own to strike. 2) As the defendant is retired from active business, this delay is not causing him any professional embarrassment or damage to reputation. This is not matter that the file is in the public's eye and therefore very few people would even know that it is currently in existence. The context in which the delay occurred is one year of inexcusable delay. 3) As examinations for discovery are completed this matter is at a point where it could well go to pre-trial conference. 4) The plaintiff has made its case and ordered the specific amounts for each structure for which Wawanea settled its claim to be disclosed. 5) As examination for discovery were completed this is approximately 2 weeks after the application for this motion had been filed. 6) The defendant is retiring from active activity and will not be able to afford to delay further litigation. This delay is entirely attributable to the defendant's failure to respond to undertakings made in 2010. It could form the basis of a disclosure order in this case should the trial judge ultimately determine that the communications sought here were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery."
"This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. HELD: The Court held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials did apply and that hearsay evidence was not admissible. The judge also held that records kept by the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The Court rejected the Crown's argument that the Crown had waived the right to compel the respondent to swear the information to justify his fear of harm to others. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; the transcript of the hearing conducted by the CSC as a whole was admissible; the officer who prepared the reports was properly authorized to testify and swore the information. The burden of proof at the hearing was reduced to that of proof on a balance of probabilities as outlined in R. v. Falle; the Supreme Court of Canada set out in its decision that 'the normal criminal rules of law apply to this type of hearing'. Hearsay evidence is admissible in evidence; the Crown did not call the authors of the reports nor did defence seek to cross-examine them. There was no evidence that the respondent, who was convicted of robbery, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail, actually feared that he would commit another offence causing death or serious harm if he was released on parole.","The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application."
"The plaintiff alleges that the defendant applied a substance in the back alley next to his property which caused damage to his lawn in the Town of Wadena. Report by Back-Track Investigations and Special Services Ltd. supports the plaintiff's belief that damage occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of a substance from the alley. However, the evidence does not support that. In preceding years, before it was moved to the Statchuk yard, it was used to store tools, machinery and applicators. The floor in it replaced before moving to his yard. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The onus is not on the defendant to prove his claim on a balance of probabilities and this involves proving that the plaintiff was responsible for killing their lawn. For the reasons stated, he has not done so.",The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. The plaintiff had not proven his claim on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was responsible for the damage to his lawn.
"The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products. Prior to 1985 that activity, exclusively wholesale, was achieved through a nation wide network of outlets leased from the appellant and operated by agents on a commission basis. Those agents were not required to make personal investment in the franchise, provide staff of two, rather than three, and were responsible for the inventory. The appellant knew from the outset that Murphy was not spending full time with the franchise. It knew from its inception that he was engaged in other businesses and could not spend full time there. It was important to maintain the integrity of the franchise and to enable prospective franchisees to enter the franchise program. The trial judge found that the appellant had not made any errors in this regard. The respondent was adjudged to recover judgment against the respondent, Yarmouth Equipment, for $206,344. The court found that it had not committed an error in this respect. The issue before the appellant was whether an exclusionary clause in a written agreement between the parties precludes giving effect to acts and statements made by the agents of the appellant to the respondent. The appellants did not establish that the trial judge made some palpable and overriding error which affected his assessment of the facts.","The appellant, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of a major international company, induced the respondent to enter a franchise agreement by making representations as to the viability of the venture. The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause. Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable."
"The respondent pled guilty to a charge that he stole a sum of money from the victim when armed with an offensive weapon, a tire iron. He was sentenced to two years in a federal institution to be followed by probation for one year on the terms and conditions as set out in the probation order of the trial judge. The Crown now sought leave to appeal and if that be granted, appeals from that sentence. The respondent was sentenced two years imprisonment to befollow probation for 1 year on terms and condition as set in the order of trial judge; a three year probation order was imposed. He had grade 11 education, was unemployed and had an admitted drug problem. This was his first offence. He wanted help for his addiction problem. Armed robberies of convenience stores late at night or early in the morning are all too prevalent and many of these are perpetrated by persons seeking money with which to purchase drugs. The trial judge recognized that her disposition was despite what happened that night and despite what the Crown had said, the sentence was not fit. Leave to appeal, allow the appeal, set aside the sentence imposed and in its place sentence the respondent to two Years in a Federal institution to being followed probation for a one year term as set by the probation orders of the probation judge. A prohibition order under s.100(1) of the Code should have been imposed. The sentence is not fit and the respondent is to be prohibited from having in his possession any firearm or any ammunition or explosive substance for a period of time commencing on the day the order is made and expiring five years after the time of the respondent's release from imprisonment.","The respondent was given a three-year suspended sentence and placed on probation after pleading guilty to armed robbery. He stole $23 from a convenience store, while armed with a tire iron. At the time, he was celebrating his birthday and was inebriated. This was his first offence. The Crown appealed the sentence. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the sentence and imposing a sentence of two years in a federal institution, followed by one year probation, with an order prohibiting possession of firearms following release. Although there were some mitigating factors, they were not such as to call for a suspended sentence considering the serious nature of the offence and its prevalence."
"FIAT. The court reserved a decision on the questions of child and spousal maintenance including costs of access and counselling. The respondent's 1996 income included the following: Employment 22,950 Unemployment insurance benefits 5,197.00 Town councillor's indemnity 700.00 Total $28,847.00 The petitioner's position was rosy. She was in receipt of unemployment insurance benefits $318 every two weeks plus whatever casual work she could obtain. Her employment with the respondent's company was terminated. Her total income in 1996 totalled $1,404.44. Given the petitioner's modest income, it was reasonable to assume that that amount will revert to the respondent, thereby increasing his receipts from the company by an equivalent amount. If there is a significant change in her income level an application to vary may be brought by the respondent. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay interim maintenance to the petitioner in the amount of $388 per month for the support of Brianna payable on the first day of each month commencing on February 1, 1997 and continuing until further order of this Court. 2)The petitioner was to retain therespondent informed of her employment status and revenue.  3)Costs including transportation were to be reviewed if the parties had not settled the matter prior to July 4, 1997. 4)Interim custody and access were reviewed on July 4.","FIAT. Interim custody of two of the children was awarded to the respondent in January 1997. The eldest resided with her mother. Decisions on child and spousal maintenance, including costs of access and counselling had been reserved. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay interim maintenance of $388 per month for the child residing with the mother and $350 per month for interim spousal maintenance. Under the guidelines he would be required to pay $1,165 per month for three children at an income level of $38,000. No abatement was made in view of the petitioner's modest income. 2)The respondent was to assume costs of twice monthly access by the petitioner and counselling costs. 3)The petitioner was to keep the respondent informed of her employment status and revenue. 4)Interim custody and access was to be reviewed July 4/97 if the parties had not settled the matter."
"The plaintiff was an employee of the defendant and over the substantial portion of that employment he acted as Town Clerk and Chief Administrative Officer. In this proceeding, he seeks indemnity for money he paid for legal expenses incurred as a result of charges he faced for alleged violation of s. 368(1)(b) of the Municipal Affairs Act. The defendant counterclaims for $11,717.94, which were legal fees remitted to the plaintiff and paid by employees of the defendants under an alleged mistake of fact that the plaintiff was acting in the course of his duties when the event which gave rise to the legal fees occurred. HELD: 1)Every one who, knowing that document is forged, causes or attempts to cause any person to use, deal with, or act on a document as if the document were genuine. This was common ground between the parties. 2)The plaintiff did not intend any criminal act and, by that he meant he did not violate s. 27 of the Act. 3)His evidence took on this type of directness. There was no question that any improper or unauthorized or unlawful act was not done for his own personal gain. 4)The defendant was found guilty of both charges.","The plaintiff was for 15 years the Town Clerk of the defendant municipality. He sought indemnity for legal expenses he incurred as a result of charges he faced for violation of s. 368 of the Criminal Code and s. 27 of the Municipal Affairs Act. The criminal charge was dropped when he plead guilty to Municipal Affairs Act charge, of diverting money from the special reserve fund for an unauthorized purpose. The defendant counterclaimed for monies it had already paid to the plaintiff. Awarding the defendant $13,502, and the defendant $5,351 on the counterclaim, that the defendant should not reimburse the plaintiff for expenses arising out of the plea of guilty on the Municipal Affairs Act charge, as the plaintiff admitted to his mistake. They should reimburse the plaintiff for expenses arising out of the criminal charge, however. In committing his mistake, which was honest and not done for personal gain, he was performing his employment duties."
"The applicant was the mother and had sole custody of the one child of the parties. By order June 7, 1996 the respondent was required to pay $750 per month as maintenance for the said child. The applicant applied pursuant to s17 of the Divorce Act to vary the order and to obtain an order that the respondent provide maintenance in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines. HELD: The respondent was found to have a gross income of $63,500.70 and a gross rental income of of $2,937.69 and additional net incomes of $22,716.00 being that portion of his living allowance deemed to be income for a total of $89,154.39. He was to pay to the petitioner, Michelle, one-half of all extracurricular expenses, to the extent that the orthodontist's costs were not covered by the dental plan of the petitioner and within 60 days of the time the petitioner provides him with receipts for these costs. Deducting all of the interest and capital cost costs, take the net rental income to $3,960.69.","The mother who had sole custody of the nine year old applied pursuant to s17 of the Divorce Act to vary an order requiring the father to pay $750 as child support and to obtain an order for maintenance in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The mother argued the father should not be allowed to deduct all of the interest or any of the capital cost associated with his rental income. HELD: 1)The father was to pay monthly child support of $754.19, retroactive to September 1/98. The father's annual net rental income of $2,937.69 and a portion of his living allowance deemed to be income were added to his gross annual employment income. 2)The father was to pay one-half of all extracurricular activities within 60 days of receiving the receipts and one half of orthodontist's costs to the extent they are not covered by the petitioner's dental plan."
"The plaintiff and his wife, who claimed to be the deceased's only surviving child, had been living in India for 14 years. They had been married for 14.5 years. Their son, who was the same age as the plaintiff, was born in India. They lived in Nova Scotia and were together for 15 years. The plaintiff eventually obtained a second estate in the United States. The defendant brought a third estate in Nova Scotia. The deceased's Will was executed in 1997. The parties had each made a separate claim for relief under the Testators' Family Maintenance Act and the Matrimonial Property Act. The cause of death was mixed drug overdose. The evidence led in both respects to the continuing claims for relief sought by the plaintiff. The present-day testamentary capacity of the deceased was in no way affected by the defendant's claim. The fact that the defendant had declared his will in a solemn form to be read by the judge at his Nova Scotia estate estate estate hearing was sufficient to justify a single hearing.","A wife claimed part of the estate of her estranged husband. The Court considered the applicability of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, the Matrimonial Property Act, and the Pension Benefits Act. Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate, that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed. To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator. This involves a very broad judicial discretion. Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance."
"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposed the application and requested a summary trial. HELD: The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as bodyshop foreman and assistant manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The Court accepted the defendant's evidence wherever it conflicts with that of the plaintiff and concluded the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. 1) Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment unless the judge is unable to decide the issues in the action in the absence of cross-examination. Taking all factors into account, the Court considers this is an appropriate notice period to which the plaintiff was entitled. 2) The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating there is a genuine need for trial. 3) The plaintiff's griping was not exactly unusual in a work place and the type of conduct alleged against the plaintiff would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his job function. 4) In the case of a person in the plaintiff's position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice period selected should reflect that management positions were fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there was a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non- management one.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs."
"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused testified on his own behalf and called his son-in-law, Richard Schmitt, as witness. The facts as outlined by the accused on the one hand and by the Crown on the other are at variance in material ways. While the bodily harm resulted directly from the effect of third parties falling on top of the accused and Mr. Brown, the third parties involved in the actual incident were all present and contributing factors. The only person who was injured was the victim's son. HELD: The accused was convicted. The court held that the jury must conclude that the accused driving was a contributing cause of death outside the deminimus range and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that Nurse was incorrectly decided and the courts in Saskatchewan prefer the approach of the B.C. Court of Appeals which held the elements of assault causing harm consist of: (1) the mens rea to commit the assault, that is the intentional application of force to the person of the victim; (2) that such force resulted in bodily harm; (3) the assault was contributing and was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the harm; and (4) the accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to the accused in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions, very short period of time elapsed between the assault and the body harm.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm."
"The applicant sought injunctive relief and an order prohibiting the respondent and Potash Corp. (the defendant) from producing and marketing potassium sulphate and restraining the defendants from selling, marketing or otherwise disposing of it during the life of the injunction. The factual foundation upon which the applicant relies is that the plaintiff entered into the Technology Licensing Agreement with the view to considering Big Quill's application for an interlocutory injunction to restrain and prohibit the respondent from producing or marketing potassium sulfate and that both defendants were aware prior to commencement of production of the product that the defendant was in receivership and had been in contact for more than a year. HELD: 1) The applicant was granted an order pursuant to ss. 65 of The Queen's Bench Act and Queen’s Bench Rule No. 387(a) prohibiting the defendant from producing any potassium sulphates and restraining both defendants from marketing or selling it on its behalf. 2) The defendant was found to have a proprietary interest in the scientific principles of ion exchange and crystallization and that the Confidentiality Agreement was not the only one that could be used to produce potassium sulphide. The defendant had obtained an exclusive license from the plaintiff to use that technology and was found not to have any contractual or other relationship with the plaintiff. 3) The plaintiff was awarded costs of the action in this regard.","The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction pursuant to s.65 of the Queen's Bench Act and Queen's Bench Rule 387(a) prohibiting and restraining the respondents from producing and manufacturing potassium sulphate near Alsask until further order; an order restraining the respondent from selling, marketing, or disposing of the potassium sulphate for profit until further order; other ancillary relief; costs of the application. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents in any event of the cause. The applicant did not demonstrate an entitlement to injunctive relief on the second and third stages of the three stage test. The applicant demonstrated there was a serious question to be tried but failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm. The delay (the action was commenced February 16, 1998) was considered. On balance the respondents would suffer greater harm if the injunction were granted as the respondent Nylen makes his living marketing and selling potassium sulphate."
"The appellant was denied access to information requested pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. The appellant had made an application to the Department of Justice (the Attorney General) for information on the proposed ADR process. Keating had been aware of the allegations and had been intimately involved in them. He was given certain 'can say' statements by former residents of the institutions which outlined all of the accusations made against him. Throughout the course of the investigation, the Department had retained Facts-Probe Inc. to conduct further interviews to obtain information for employee discipline, possible criminal prosecution and ultimately to process insurance claims. In the process, the applicant was provided with information about the proposed 'alternative dispute resolution' process, which would allow him to compensate victims for the abuse he suffered as a result of participating in the process. The applicant was also provided with a list of all the alleged victims, their names, ages and occupations, and their contact information. The application was refused and the respondent was ordered to return to the Justice Department for further questioning. The respondent was also ordered to pay costs to the applicant in accordance with the terms of the Access to Information and Privacy Act (ADA). Throughout the entire process, there was much publicity and media attention and the degree to which the various roles of the R.C.M.P. and Department of justice had meshed and interchangeable was clearly set forth in paras. 11-33 of the affidavit of Inspector Atkins. The appeal was taken from a decision of Robert Doherty, Freedom of information and Protectionof Privacy Act Coordinator in October 1998. The parties involved in the application for the information were referred to as the 'victims' or'survivors'.","The applicant was aware that allegations of abuse had been made against him in an alternative dispute resolution process undertaken by the Province with respect to his former employment. He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations. The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed. Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven. The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo. The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes. The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant. Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province. There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy. The applicant was entitled to know what he had been accused of and should have the right to correct the record."
"The accused was convicted by a Provincial Court judge of having care and control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge acquitted him of a charge under s.253(b) after trial. On appeal, the Court of Queen's Bench judge set aside the conviction and ordered an acquittal. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The trial judge erred with respect to the nature of the charge when she focussed on post-driving conduct when the charge was care and Control. 2)The court made inaccurate assessments of the evidence and the conclusions of the trial judge. 3)The acquittal because of a reasonable doubt on the.08 charge did not have, expressly or inferentially, included in it finding by the Court that he accepted the testimony that the accused's blood alcohol was between.068 and.081 at the time of driving. He did not, in fact, so accept the testimony of the testified witness. It was inconsistent with the facts and the judgment of the Court on those facts to say that the appellant did not see any indicia of impairment. 4)The conviction could not stand. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of imprisonment was set aside and the Provincial Court was restored.","The accused was convicted of having care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired (Criminal Code s.253(a)) but acquitted on the charge under s.253(b). The Provincial Court trial judge did not accept the accused's testimony that his blood-alcohol concentration was between .068 and .081 at the time of driving. On appeal the Queen's Bench judge set aside the conviction and ordered an acquittal. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Queen's Bench judgment was set aside and the Provincial Court trial judgment was restored. While the appellate judge stated the correct standard of review, he did not in fact apply it and made inaccurate assessments of the evidence and conclusion of the trial judge."
"The husband applied for an interlocutory order that the matrimonial home be sold and ordered to return to the wife certain personal belongings. The wife had been cut off her husband's medical insurance coverage and would not receive any further income until she started receiving old age security and CPP. She also wanted title to her house back. The husband applied to have the home sold, claiming reversible error in two respects: first, that he had no evidence to justify selling the home and that he was influenced by irrelevant considerations relating to the husband's behaviour; and second, that the Chambers judge had ordered the sale of the home without the benefit of professional appraisal or any compelling reason. HELD: Appeal allowed with costs and case remitted to the Supreme Court for a rehearing on an expedited basis. 1) There was no reason why the matter could not be heard again by the Court of Appeal should its schedule permit it. Findings of credibility were entirely within the province and it might accelerate these proceedings and bring about a more timely conclusion if he were able to hear it. 2) The husband's application for an order to sell the home was dismissed. It was obvious to the judge and the parties that it would be impossible for the wife to maintain the home with its attendant monthly mortgage obligations without financial assistance. 3) At no time did the husband try to quantify the division of property he was looking for, let alone express the view that he is seeking an equal division of assets, or even half of the Home equity, unless wrong principles of law have been applied or patent injustice would result. 4) In the unusual circumstances of this appeal, the husband had costs in the amount of $1,500 inclusive of disbursements in any event of the cause but not payable until the earlier of either the sale or the final settlement of the issues.","In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home. The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value."
"The parties were married for four years and had four children. They separated in October 2004 after the petitioner (who was working part-time and lived with her mother when she was not attending university) filed a counter-petition for divorce. The parties' four children, aged eight, nine and ten years, lived with their mother when they were living with their father. The mother, who was employed with the federal government, was the primary caregiver to the children. She worked part- time and sometimes lived with a friend. She claimed that the father did not help with the care of the children (because he was a taxi driver) and at times created additional hurdles by refusing to assist in transporting the children to daycare during the week and refusing to co-sign the child's student loan application. HELD: The Court held that it would be in the children's best interests to remain in the custody and primary care of their mother. The court also held that the respondent should have the primary custody of the two younger children (who were now fifteen and thirteen years of age) and that it was in the best interests of the parties to have their living arrangements arrangements set up in accordance with their respective constitutions and laws. The respondent was 65 years old and retired. He drove a taxi from time to time. He lived with his mother when he was working. The petitioner was a social worker and obtained two university degrees. She also sought primary care. The Court found that the parties' inability to reconcile over the past few years had resulted in a permanent breakdown of the marriage. The children had not been able to live with their parents for several years and there was little reason to believe that they would ever be able to have a functional relationship with their new home.","Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors."
"The accused was charged with committing an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The complainant was the common-law spouse of the accused and had been for seven years. She was upset and crying and asked the police to call the police. The police arrived within minutes of the complainant arriving at her neighbour's residence. She asked to be called to the police station to provide statement and have photographs taken of her injuries. On the trial date, the Crown applied to have the initial statements made by the complainant admitted into evidence for the truth of their contents, as an exception to the rule which excludes hearsay evidence. Evidence was then called on voir dire. HELD: The Court found that the test of reliability had been met.  1) The complainant's evidence was important to the Crown's case and there was no other means of obtaining that evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she was a hostile witness was immaterial at this stage.  2) The accused's character was examined as a further indicator of reliability. The Court held that the tests for reliability were met when the witness recanted on an earlier statement. The earlier statement was necessary evidence because evidence of the same quality could not be obtained at trial. The fact that a witness is available at trial does not preclude the prior statement from being 'necessary'. 3) In the case at hand, it was clear that the complainant was upset, scared and crying. She had fresh red marks on her neck and chest, which corresponded with her description of the incident and she stated that she was very upset with the accused. The accused had punched her in the neck and left the apartment without saying a word.  4) The Court noted that there were no other indicators of reliability as determined by the Court in R.v. Khelawon, 2006 SCC 57 (CanLII).","The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made."
The accused applied for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant and the evidence ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused argued that the Provincial Court judge did not have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. HELD: The evidence was admissible. The accused's application was dismissed. 1)The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications between the complainant and the accused wherein the complainant would attempt to engage the accused in conversation involving their alleged sexual activity. It is reasonable to presume that such a scenario could quite likely result in the accused making admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of his allegations. 2)The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not violate the accused's s. 8 rights. 3)The intercept evidence was non-conscriptive. If there was a breach it was not serious and was inadvertent. The breach was not the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There was no evidence of bad faith. The admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 4)The accused was awarded his costs of the application.,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute."
"The Respondent was a spouse within the meaning of the Pension Benefits Standards Act and the Pension Security Standards Act but was separated from his wife, the biological mother of the applicants. The respondent was employed by Marine Atlantic for thirty-one years. During that period, the estate received no monies from the corporation. The applicants sought the removal of the personal representative, who was a former employee of the corporation, and a pension plan beneficiary, and therefore was not entitled to the survivor benefits. The Respondent applied for an order removing the personal representatives as they were in conflict. The applicant argued that the respondent should be removed as Adminstratrix of the Estate and that the estate should pursue an action in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against the corporation and the corporation for payment into the estate of the pension plan entitlement earned by the Intestate and for reimbursement by the corporation of the amounts already paid to her. The respondents argued that they were entitled to survivor benefits pursuant to the plan but believed the applicant was the spouse of the deceased and entitled to be paid survivor benefits under the plan. The application was dismissed. HELD: The application must fail. The removal of Joan McGean as personal representative is not in the 'best interests of those persons interested in the estate' (aside from the fact that the applicant is a spouse) and is not a common law spouse, and the termination of the respondent's pension benefits would be of no benefit to her as a spouse. The estate took no steps to change the Respondent's status in law, that is, he never divorced her.","The intestate's biological child, who was one of the personal representatives of the estate, wished to sue the intestate's former employer to have the pension to which he was entitled at the time of his death paid into the estate. The other personal representative of the estate, who was the intestate's spouse, was in receipt of survivor benefits under the pension and, as such, was opposed to the intended court action. The biological child applied to have his stepmother removed as a personal representative of the estate. Application dismissed; the removal of the personal representative would only be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate if the intended lawsuit was feasible, which it was not. The estate was bound by the terms of the pension plan, which provided that the respondent was clearly entitled, as the spouse of the intestate, to survivor benefits and the payment of a lump sum into her estate if she died within five years of the intestate's retirement."
"An appeal from a conviction in the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan that the appellant did, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The trial judge was in a position to test the credibility of the officer who made the demand for a sample of the appellant's breath after making the formal arrest as argued by the appellant. 2) Even excluding the slurred speech and bloodshot eyes, the remaining indicia which the officer observed provide ample evidence to support her belief the appellant was operating his motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired. The trial court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample. 3) The appeal is not clear that the trial judge observed the bloodshot eye of the respondent after the registration of the vehicle. In coming to his conclusion he considered the totality of the evidence. The court found the officer's conclusion was supported by the facts. 4) The appellant's belief was based on the observation that he was driving with a flat tire and with the vehicle's windshield wipers operating although it was a clear night, as well as all the indicia of impairment referenced above.","The appellant was convicted of driving over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath."
"After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the Court declared him a long-term offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. The defendant appealed from this sentence. He argued that during the dangerous offender hearing the judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long term offender instead of a dangerous offender. He also conceded that the defendant was not willing to take the high intensity sexual offender program because he refused to accept responsibility for the offences. He then filed a notice of appeal stating that he was doing a life sentence for two sexual assaults but that he would not participate in sexual offender treatment if he never had the chance to participate in it. He followed this up with a letter dated August 28, 2010 to this Court. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The judge was not bound to accept the experts' assessment. He was free to take their assessment and weigh it. 2) The defendant was found to be doing a worse sentence than he was before. The court was also found to have misapprehended evidence. 3) The court found that both the defendant’s behaviour and that of the complainant were consistent with that of a person who had been previously incarcerated and who had expressed a reasonable hope of eventual control of risk in the community. 4) In addition to the reports and testimony of the complainants, the defendant had been in custody since June 2005 for four degrading sexual assaults upon vulnerable women and had been released from prison for less than 2 months when the predicate offences were committed on May 28, 2005.","The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal."
"The plaintiff union and its representatives republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The union and the plaintiff brought an action to recover general damages of $25,000. The trial judge found that the defamatory statements were protected by qualified privilege and fixed general damages at $100,000 (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The plaintiff union appealed the decision of the trial judge, who held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and members when the latter republished the grievance. He also fixed the award of general damages, which were to be paid out at $50,000 to the plaintiff. The parties then brought an application to have the arbitrator find that the words of the union were capable of bearing defamedatory meaning notwithstanding the overarching labour relations context. Application allowed; general damages fixed at $200,000; the plaintiff union's appeal dismissed with costs to the union awarded at $75,000 in the amount of the provisional award. The court reviewed the history and context of the publications and concluded that the defence of absolute privilege does not apply in this case. It is possible, within the context of a trial judge's decision, that statements made by a union regarding a member or its representatives may be defamed by the publication of the statements. In this case, the words expressed by the Union were not defamatories but rather allegations with which the plaintiff strongly disagreed. The plaintiff's position that he had been defamed was not supported by the evidence, nor was he motivated by malice, but rather by an attempt to find corroborating witnesses, was not so intimately connected with the process as to justify the extension of the defence for absolute privilege, and was in fact an attempt by the union to establish that its allegations were entirely unsubstantiated and without substance.","The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed."
"FIAT: The plaintiff, CN applied to the Court seeking orders that the defendants, Clarke Transport and Clarke Transport, answer certain questions which they refused to answer on discovery. The application raises interesting issues with respect to the proper scope of questioning or examination for discovery. HELD: 1) The Court found that when the Court moved from the words of touching and relating to any matter in issue, it intended to move away from the broad relevance test that existed under the former Queen's Bench Rules. 2) It is clear that the insurance adjuster's file would be subject to a litigation privilege. There is no evidence that this obligation under the rules has not been complied with.  3) With respect to matters relating to railcars previously loaded by Clarke, it is concluded that the company's counsel advised the plaintiff that they did not have a position on what caused the derailment and if they developed a position they would advise the plaintiff. 4) The history of these 445 cars may be relevant to the issue of negligence in loading the subject car, but such relevance is limited by the nature of the undertakings. It is not appropriate for the Court to order the plaintiff to answer specific questions or to provide proper answers. 5) The application is dismissed with costs of $1,500 to the plaintiff in any event of the cause.","HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers."
"The parties were self-represented at a case management conference. At that time the Sykes indicated they were going to be making an application to have portions of the action struck. The plaintiff amended claim to claim damages from overhanging trees on their property. The amended claim was successful and the parties were allowed to self-represent. HELD: The portion of the plaintiff's amended claim that was struck was allowed to proceed. The court held that an injunction ordering the trees to be removed was 'beyond the authority of this Court.' It was not necessary for the plaintiff to prove the damage to the property was caused by the trees, but it was clearly a remedy this Court had no jurisdiction to grant. The defendant's request for an injunction was struck as frivolous and vexatious. Even if the plaintiff could prove the debris was solely from the sykes' trees, this would not be sufficient to strike the claim. The issue was whether the claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action.","The Court allowed the application in part. It struck the portion of the claim with respect to damages from debris falling from the defendants’ tree. Even if proven, the damages were part of urban life. The plaintiff claimed for injunctive relief ordering the trees to be removed. The Court had no jurisdiction to grant this relief. The amended claim could proceed limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees into the plaintiff’s property and whether the trees invaded the plaintiff’s air space."
"Continental Seafoods applied for a refund of health services tax paid on refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring. The contract contained stringent quality specifications governing the processing of the product which included a phase where the pickling occurs in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to ‑2ºC. The applicant argued that this was a new matter, not presented by the parties or considered by the Minister, and was not proper consideration on appeal. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and allowing the claim to be appealed, that the province tax authority can only be set aside when a claim has been made for refund under s. 10(1)(h)(I) of the Act. Once it has been established that the machinery or apparatus is used in any degree in the manufacturing process, this is sufficient. The use of a cold room in the process performed a function that was part of the manufacture or production of the products, and thus the tax paid should not have been apportioned based on the use of the equipment in production.","The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act. The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product."
The applicant sought an interim distribution of matrimonial property and interim support for her two children and an order prohibiting the respondent from contacting her and from going to her workplace. An interim order granted the wife exclusive possession of the parties' farm home with the exception of the tool shed and other parts of the farm yard which the husband was required to enter for the purpose of farming. Both parties were ordered to have no contact with each other and the respondent was ordered to pay periodic child support if he got a job off the farm. HELD: The application was dismissed.  The court was not prepared to vary the order of May 27 and October 19 which prevented the husband from approaching the home quarter.,"The Wife sought an interim distribution of matrimonial property and periodic maintenance for the 2 children of the marriage, aged 16 and 13. The Husband had not made an interim lump sum payment in the amount of $2,000.00 ordered in May and had undertaken to provide support monies after harvest. The Husband claimed that the value of the crop harvested was less than the farm expenses and resisted any change in the previous interim orders made. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court was not prepared to make the interim orders requested on the basis of the contradictory affidavits filed. A pre-trial was directed."
This was an appeal against a decision wherein the appellant was convicted of an offence contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. The officer who had accompanied the accused to the hospital for treatment for injuries received in a single motor vehicle accident had asked him if he had been drinking and when the accident had occurred as this information might be important to his treatment or any prescription he might give. At issue was whether the trial judge had erred when she found the appellant's rights under s.8 of the Charter were not violated. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)The obtaining of the information from the doctor as the basis of formulating the demand was not analogous to a search and seizure within the meaning of Section 8 of The Charter. 2)The trial judge did not err when she concluded the appellant had breached his common law duty of confidentiality to his patient. 3)The Court held the provision to the police by the doctor of specific medical information about the appellant without his consent did not violate the officer's right to confidentiality.,"This was an appeal from a trial court decision questioning whether the trial judge erred in determining that the appellant's rights under s.7 and s.8 of the Charter had not been violated. When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital. As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter. The trial judge did not err in determining that the appellant's rights were not violated under either s.7 or s.8 of the Charter."
"FIAT. The Crown applied to have the witness, who is an unindicted co-conspirator in this matter andseparately charged with drug offences arising out of this same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s. 9 of the Canada Evidence Act on the basis that she has demonstrated ahostile attitude towards the position of the Crown and hascontradicted in a substantial way, her prior video-taped statement to police officers made shortly after her arrest. The defence sought to use her prior statement as substantive evidence. HELD: 1)Annette Cook's prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its subjectents. It will be for the jury to decide after receiving appropriate instructions with respect to the evidence of an officer who has provided consistent testimony. 2)The reliability threshold is not met in the absence of an appropriate substitute for an oath where appropriate substitutes for the oath exist. 3)The credibility of the witness is determined on the balance of probabilities on the question of reliability. 4)The evidence of the officer who administered the contemporaneous oath or affirmation does not corroborate every individual's statements on the videotape but does so sufficiently in enough different particulars to allow the Court to decide what portions of the statement they wish to accept. 5)When, as here, there is only one demonstrably falsepiece of testimony, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court is not prepared to say that ipso facto the Balance of the Statementis unreliable. 6)The Court is satisfied on thebalance of probabilities that her statement, but for thedemonstrably false portion, meets the threshold of reliability and that her claim to have been induced by an adverse relationship with the Crown has been met within the meaning of the test for reliability.","FIAT. The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability."
"The accused was employed by Uncle Charlie's as a doorman and relief bartender. During the course of the evening there were two minor incidents and exchanges between the accused and the accused. The accused says he observed the accused make a motion or gesture which he interpreted as an invitation to get involved with him. He alleges that the accused grabbed him and turned him around, to defuse the situation. He was not drinking on the occasion. The Crown witnesses testified that Baikie was more aggressive than the Crown would have us believe and that he threw several blows to the accused, either at the complainant's head or his face. HELD: The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The facts were as stated by the Crown witnesses, with the qualification the accused did indeed attempt to 'get at' the accused whilst being restrained by Layman. He may have thrown punch at the accused or attempted to do so, but his efforts were quite ineffectual. In hisinebriated state, he was no threat to him and that theaccused in fact took advantage of the situation to administer a 'beating to' to him. The defence witnesses' descriptions of the events were consistent with the accused's stated intent to get at him and to cause him harm. He did not throw a punch, nor did he use force. The complainant's argument that he was knocked unconscious by the altercation was not supported by the evidence.","The accused, employed as doorman and relief bartender at the time of the altercation, was charged with assault causing bodily harm in which the complainant sustained significant injuries to his head and face. Three crown witnesses and five defence witnesses testified as to the altercation in the bar. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The self-defence argument was not accepted. Neither s.34 or s.37 of the Criminal Code justified the assault. 2)The testimony of the Crown witnesses was accepted. The complainant was no threat to the accused in his inebriated state and the accused took advantage of the situation to administer a beating to him. The injuries were not consistent with the scenario described by the accused and the witnesses."
"The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy. Section 181 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act reads as ""(1) Where in the opinion of the court, a receiving order ought not to have been made on an assignment ought not have been filed, the court may by order annul the bankruptcy."" This application is twofold. Firstly the bankrupt received misinformation or had amisunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and secondly secondly the undervaluation of his assets. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to apply for an order declaring bankruptcy which would result in the bankrupting of his trustee and the creditors being paid in full much more expeditiously than would otherwise take. Certain of the builders' liien claimants had already commenced an action. 2)There was evidence that prior to bankruptcy the bankrupt attempted to deal with his financial problem through the orderly payment of debts but found out on an informal basis that it would be defeated. There was likely merit to the bankrupt's contention that the bankruptcy proceedings have been of no value to him. The majority of secured creditors, who are secured, would also benefit from the repayment of the loan. 3)There were other actions by secured creditors returnable in Queen's Bench as early as next week.","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy on the grounds that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and because his assets had been undervalued. He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants. The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy. The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy. HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. The onus will be on the bankrupt to comply with the requirements of the trustee to qualify for an automatic discharge on November 15/98 or an early discharge as provided for in s168.1(2)."
"The parties separated in 1999 and each sought interim custody of their 1 year old son, born October 10, 1997. HELD: Interim custody was granted to the respondent with access to the primary residence and to the child maintenance person. 1)The respondent was 31 years old and was employed as unit secretary at the General Hospital. She remained at home with the child for the first year after his birth and then returned to work at the hospital. She had been permitted to see the child on two occasions for four hours on each occasion. She attempted to commit suicide May 1, 1998. She was convicted of driving while over.08 as a result of the incident. The respondent was hospitalized for approximately 3 weeks in order to receive psychiatric assistance. 2)It was in the respondent's best interests to be in the custody of her son. S.W.S. should be returned forthwith to C.J.S.'s parents for return to normal working hours and to return to the petitioner's furniture, clothing and other belongings. 3)The petitioner was to have access on three days each week while he was off work. The court was to find that the respondent had no personal knowledge of same and it was denied by the petitioner that there were drugs in her system. 4)The child care person shall be responsible for 75% of the child care costs actually incurred. The petitioner shall also be responsible to reimburse the respondent for 75 percent of those costs within 15 days of presentation of the bills. 5)Costs of care were to be determined on the basis of the interim custody order.  6)The court was satisfied that the petitioner had taken steps to deal with her psychological and psychiatric difficulties. The child care professional was to arrange for the child's access on the third day each week.","The parties were married in September 1996 and subsequently separated in April of 1999. The parties both seek custody of their only child born in October 1997. The issues before the court is interim custody and primary residence of the child, access by the other parent and interim child maintenance. The parties filed evidence that was considerably contradictory relating to each other and respective abilities as parent. viva voce hearing was held to assist determining the questions of credibility. The mother aged 31 years of age, is employed as secretary. The mother remained at home during the first year of the child's birth then returned to work. The mother suffered from post partum depression following the child's birth and as result attempted to commit suicide. She was hospitalized for three weeks to receive psychiatric assistance. The psychiatrist who treated the mother states the mother is unlikely to have future suicide attempts and has responded well to treatment. The child was with the mother every afternoon during her hospitalization and the mother bonded with her son. The father is currently employed at Ipsco on shift work and is currently living with his parents. The father has had the child since the separation and the child has had little access with his mother. HELD: The child's primary residence should be with the mother. Based on the information before the Court, the mother has always been the primary caregiver of the child and remained at home with the child for the first year of his life. The mother was responsible for the child's day to day needs, health care and child care. As well the father asserts that he was involved in the child's health care needs but was unable to name the child's pediatrician. The father will have access to the child for three days when he is not working including overnight access. The father's gross annual income is $48,897 which results in a payment to the mother for child maintenance in the sum of $393.00 payable on the first day of each and every month until further ordered by the Court. In addition the father will responsible for 75% of the child care expenses."
"The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by Lorne Putnam's company. The three brothers each formed a new company at that time with Gene owning the dairy farm and Merle owning the trailer park and gravel pit operation. The plan was to incorporate new company called 'Geneco.' Gene Putnam died in 1982 and after his death his company changed over to a single quota system known as Total Production Quota (TPQ). Therefore any sales after that date were under the new quota scheme. The plaintiff argued that the agreement only refers to the Fluid Milk Quota and therefore it was obligated to only share proceeds from the sale of the sold version of the quota and not all quota sold. The defendant agreed to split the proceeds three ways. First, it was agreed that all three brothers would get a share of the sale proceeds. The second, the agreement was not binding on any of the plaintiffs. The third, and the most important issue was the sharing of proceeds from a sale of only one quota. The plaintiffs sought to have the agreement interpreted as meaning that the three brothers and their company were obligated to share proceeds only from sales of only the one quota sold and that all other quota sold should be retained by the actual milk producer. The parties agreed that the quota would be transferred to the new company and that if the quota was disposed of prior to 2003 it would be shared equally among the brothers. The agreement was based on the terms of the previous agreement which clearly indicated that they and their father had agreed that they would have joint ownership of all the milk quota owned by the company and the Market Share Quota. The fourth, and perhaps the most significant issue, was the possibility of a tax consequences resulting from the reorganization of the parent company. Granting the plaintiffs the costs of interpreting the agreement, that the plaintiffs were entitled to a share in any sale of any quota sold, regardless of whether the quota is changed or not.","The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales. The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties."
"The issue was whether the Agreement was a lease or a security agreement. The dealer and the owner entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' of $9,320 and the same amount by semi-annual installments commencing December 15, 1997 and continuing until June 15, 2002 with the final 'termination value' payment of $23,650 to be paid at the owner's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The evidence was clear that the parties treated the trade-in as the advance payment even though the value of the trade in did not equal the amount of the advance Payment; the difference being $679.33 (between $10,000.00 and $9.320). HELD: The claim was dismissed. The defendant was awarded costs of $42,089 with costs on the basis of Column D of the Tariff of Costs. 1)The Agreement had many of the attributes of a lease but the Agreement itself used notions such as retail financing and secured party. It would be unjust to make any further order under the Act in these circumstances and in the absence of an evidentiary basis, for example, of the fair market value at the time of the seizure as required for an order under s.55(c) of the Act.  2)The primary incidents of ownership are use of the sprayers for all of its useful life with the obligation to pay the capital cost plus the cost of investment, acquisition of substantial interest, and loss or gain from unusual depreciation or appreciation of the value. Ergo, the transaction falls within the ambit of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, and Case Credit's right to recover the unpaid purchase money is restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2)of the Act (SSG). 3)The parties were to have a specified period of time from which title was reserved until the owner elected to pay. The Agreement has many attributes of ownership, such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, realize on security and retail sales contract. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law.","The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3."
"The appellant and the respondent, while not married, lived together in a 'common law relationship' for approximately ten years. Two children were born out of this relationship. The respondent separated in 1995. The appellant commenced an application under the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of the parties' assets. In conjunction with that application, the appellant sought a declaration that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is infringed by the definition of'spouse' in s. 2(g) of the MPA. The MPA does not apply to the appellant and respondent because they do not come within the definition in the Family Maintenance Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent was present during the hearing of the appeal but made no representations. 2)The application was allowed. The Court assumed the facts as set out in their respective affidavits and concluded that the applicant's s. 15(1) Charter rights were infringed and that the infringement was not saved by s. 1. 3)The Court was not satisfied that the conclusions drawn by the Chambers judge were analogous to those reached by the appellant on the basis of the equitable distribution of the assets between the parties. 4)The appellant was awarded costs of the application. 5)The applicant was awarded general damages of $50,000, $60,000 and $70,000. 6)Costs of the constitutional challenge were awarded in the amount of $45,000 to the respondent.","The appellant and respondent lived together in common law relationship for approximately ten years. Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets. They separated in 1995. The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets. She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect. This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter."
"The accused was charged with second degree murder contrary to s. 235 after she was confronted by the husband who had sexually assaulted her and threatened to kill her if she dropped the assault and sexual assault charges. The Crown tendered statements that were made by the deceased to several Crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents of choking. The defence argued that s. 589 of the Criminal Code should be considered bar to the admissibility of the statements made by Michelle Lenius to her friends, family and co-workers. The court questioned the relevance of hearsay statements to the trial judge regarding the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The evidence is admissible on a principled basis and must not be confused with the evidence of similar fact evidence. The principles of the principled approach are not to be expanded on by the trial court in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial. 1) The trial judge must not invade the province of fact and condition admissiblilty on whether the evidence is ultimately reliable. However, it will need to examine whether the circumstances in which the statement was made lend sufficient credibility to allow a finding of threshold reliability. 2) Hearsay evidence is presumptively inadmissible and it should not be admitted in order for the trial to ensure a fairtrial. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact information has not been overcome by its probative value and it must not been admitted in the order to determine the possibility that a fair Trial will be held.","Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath."
"The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived. The sentence was made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Code. Section 737 states: 737. (1) Subject to subsection (5), an offender who is convicted or discharged under section 730 of an offence under this Act or the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act shall pay a victim surcharges in addition to any other punishment imposed on the offender. (2) The sentencing judge failed to comply with s. 730(1) of the Criminal Code or, alternatively, the explicit provisions of ss. 737(5) and (6) of Code. This is particularly true where an offender is exempted from payment of a Victim surcharge due to undue hardship. The maximum surcharge for an offence of this nature is 15 per cent. This applies particularly where the sentencing judge has consistently and consistently raised the maximum amount of surcharges by the entire court.","The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived. The appeal is made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The imposition of a victim fine surcharge under s. 737 of the code is mandatory subject only to an application under s. 737(5) relating to undue hardship. If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharge, it is also mandatory that the Court give reasons. The sentence is varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30."
"The plaintiff, an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Saskatoon Civic Employees' Union, commenced this action under the simplified procedure of Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules seeking judgment for $50,000. The plaintiff's claim is grounded on a provision of the Union's by-laws which reads: 12.1 a) Defending an action or proceeding against Union officer claiming liability on the part of that Union officer for acts or omissions done by the Union officer in the course of his/her duties or paying any sum required to settle the action; b) Damages and costs awarded against union officer as result of the failure to enforce the indemnity by-law; c)Exhausting internal remedies The dispute in the Fourth Action involves a contractual debate concerning the meaning and scope of an indemnity clause. This is substantially different from an internecine dispute in a voluntary sports organization respecting the disciplining of high school coach over recruiting practices. Nothing in the Union by-laws precludes the plaintiff from seeking relief from the Courts before making a final appeal to the CUPE National office. HELD: The Court held that it had jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff's application for summary judgment pursuant to Queen’s Bench Rule 485 and that it should not deprive the plaintiff of the opportunity to bring this application in the absence of a clear and enforceable provision excluding his access to the Courts. 1)In absence of some statutory regime precluding the Court from intervening in disputes of this nature, the debate in the fourth action is totally appropriate for disposition by the Court. 2)The plaintiff is not entitled to indemnity under the by-Laws. The Act provides the Labour Relations Board with exclusive domain on many matters dealing with industrial relations. 3)The dispute is, in its essential character, contractual in nature; namely, is the plaintiff entitled to the benefits of the indemnities clause in the union membership contract. The essential nature of the debate between Taylor and the Union relates to the interpretation of the terms of the union by-Law. 4)This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the LRB. The forum for this contest is The Queen”s Bench Court.","The plaintiff is an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Union. He commenced this claim based on the Indemnity Clause contained in the Union's bylaws. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success."
"The parties were married for 37 years and had two children. The respondent applied to vary the period of retroactive child support based on the evidence of the petitioner and the respondent's mother. The petitioner argued that although the parties' corollary relief judgment provided for a shared parenting arrangement and equal sharing of all special and extraordinary expenses, the court did not have jurisdiction to grant retroactive support for the older child because the petitioner was not, at the time of the application, a child of the marriage. The younger child clearly left the charge of his parents in April 2008 and established an independent household without the consent, agreement, approval or financial support of the parties. He did not seek any of these from his parents when doing so. The evidence established that the respondent and his girlfriend took up residence in a downtown Toronto apartment in 2008. HELD: 1)The respondent's application to vary was retroactive to July 2004. This is also the year when the respondent gave notice of his intention to seek an increase in support. 2)The trial judge did not allow the petitioner's mother's costs claim. 3)The court had jurisdiction to consider the application of the respondent for retroactive variation of child support and a readjustment of the claim for section 7 expenses pertaining to her older child. 4)The issues raised by the petitioner were determined primarily to jurisdiction and not the result of the result. The court was not precluded from ruling on the merits of the applicant's claim. 5)The petitioner's conduct was speculative and conjecture. However, it was found to be within the court's jurisdiction to make a retroactive order for an adult child and was not relevant to the cause of this application.  6)The parties agreed the respondent had contributed to his/her child's support in a way that satisfied his or her obligation, and therefore no retroactive award should be ordered.","The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father."
"The appellant company appealed the assessment of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The mall was owned by the appellant company. HDL Investments Inc. was dissatisfied with the City Assessor's determination of its fair value. The company appealed to the Court of Appeal under section 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act, S.S. 1988-89 c. M-23. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The sale verification information obtained by the Assessor in relation to the sale of the mall was of considerable importance and merited considerable weight. The sale price satisfied the remaining criteria of Document 1.1.6, namely that it represented the fee simple interest in the property, did not include atypical financing or other conditions of sale, and was not a substitute for the sale price of the other shopping malls.  2) The Committee did not misapprehend the importance, generally, of the sale verification process and the information it yielded. The importance lies in the fact municipal assessors are highly dependent on the information at his command, including the information supplied to him by the parties to the transaction. Hence the Committee erred in law in upholding the decision that the sale qualified for inclusion in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived or, alternatively, to have it acquired its interest on an arm's length sale. The amount paid to the Committee was not sufficient to buttress this power of the assessor and secure the performance of this duty of the person. Section 172 of The Cities Act bars consideration, on the appeal of an assessment, of any information that is substantially at variance with information provided in the assessment manual. 3) There was no material error on the part of the Committee regarding the sale.","This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed."
"The plaintiffs applied for certification of a proposed multi-jurisdictional class action involving Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride), a prescription drug approved in Canada for the treatment of depression, anxiety disorder, panic disorder and other conditions. The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18 years of age. An affidavit filed by the respondent indicates that he took Paxil when he was under 18. The respondent applies for leave to cross-examine him on his affidavit. HELD: The application for certification is granted. The court has a relatively wide discretion in relation to the requirement in ss. 6(d) of the Saskatchewan Act that a class action be the preferable procedure and that cross-examination on an affidavit will not result in an injustice to the respondent. There are a number of statements contained in the respondent's affidavit that, when considered in the context of an application to certification under the Act, they are relevant to issues that must be determined by the court pursuant to ss.6(1) and 6.1 of the Class Actions Act. However, the issues to be resolved on certification application are complex and trial of an issue is not practical alternative where there is conflict in the evidence. A cross- examination will not assist the court in applying the criterion set out in s. 6 and 7 of the Act. It will be conducted at any reasonable location chosen by the applicant and the plaintiffs' counsel.","The plaintiffs have applied for certification of proposed multi-jurisdictional class action involving Paxil, prescription drug approved in Canada for the treatment of depression, anxiety, panic disorder and other conditions. The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18 years of age. The defendant applies for leave to cross-examine the representative plaintiff on his affidavit pursuant to Rule 317 of The Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The decisions reviewed by the Court all support the view that leave to cross-examine under Rule 317 is granted more readily in proposed class actions than it is in other civil proceedings. None support the proposition that proposed representative plaintiff is immune from cross-examination in respect of his or her individual claim. Cross-examination of proposed representative plaintiff may explore matters pertaining to his or her individual claim in the context of issue that must be determined by the court pursuant to s. and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act. A cross-examination of the plaintiff in this case may assist the court in applying the criterion set out in s. 6 and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act. The application for leave to cross-examine is granted."
"The plaintiff obtained a lien under The Builders' Lien Act for the services of the defendant. The defendant brought a motion seeking leave to enter final judgment against the plaintiff in the amount of $2,800 with interest to date of judgment and judgment entitling the plaintiff to maintain his lien. The plaintiff contended that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that, therefore, there had been a breach of the implied condition of the agreement that it would be performed in a workmanlike manner. HELD: The plaintiff's workmanship constitutes a breachof contract, and the defendant's damages are set off against the claim. The issue before the court is whether the plaintiff is liable to pay the defendant’s outstanding account. The court found that the plaintiff’d workmanship was not up to industry standards and that the quality of installation was of such standard as to amount to poor workmanship. The plaintiffs claim was dismissed for breach of contract, as the amount required to fix the damage was not even a reasonable amount. The claim for breach was set off for a simplified trial.","The defendant contracted with the plaintiff for supply and installation of materials. The defendant was not satisfied with the plaintiff's work, hired a third party to fix the plaintiff's work and refused to pay the plaintiff. The plaintiff sued for payment of the outstanding account HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The Court found enough evidence to conclude that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that there was a breach of the implied condition that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard. As the plaintiff's workmanship constitutes a breach of contract, the defendant's damages are set off against the claim."
"The respondent applies for judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act so that he might serve a three-year prison sentence imposed as a result of his conviction, in that country, for criminally negligent homicide (an offence equivalent to that of manslaughter in Canada). Romania opposes the application. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The respondent has not established that he will surrender himself into custody were to release him. He is a Convention refugee. It is not my place to look behind that status on an application of this nature. There is an arguable basis for submitting to the Minister that he should not be surrendered to Romania. 2) On the basis of the committal order, the respondent's failure to abide by the terms of his community-based sentence and the fact that he has no real property and has identified no significant activities that connect him to the jurisdiction are fact. 3) While there is a risk of non-appearance in extradition proceedings, the Court finds that it would be non-sensical for the respondent to flee before the Minister's decision on his surrender to Romania, neither are they great. The respondent's application before the Court is also dismissed. 4) Romania's submissions as to the deficiencies in the nature and extent of the sureties proffered by the respondent are compelling. 5) In the context of review by the Minister under s. 679 of the Criminal Code, this means that the Court will not delve into the validity of the proceedings against the applicant or assess the merits of the applicant's appeal therefrom or response thereto.","The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed."
"The accused was charged with three counts of dangerous driving, one of which related to his failure to recognize stopped vehicles in an active construction zone. The accused had been charged with operating a motor vehicle in a manner that was dangerous to the public and thereby caused the death of three young boys.

The aggravating and mitigating factors in the case were not considered, as was the length of the driving prohibition and the driver's blood alcohol content. Criminal Code s.718.2(e) applied, which provides for a sentence of six years plus one day in federal institution for each count. The principles of sentencing, which must be carefully considered, must be applied in order to determine the ultimate sentence should be for the accused. This is an intricate process that must be crafted with great care by the sentencing judge in determining what the ultimate sentenced should be. It is a very difficult task for any judge especially when it involves the deaths of multiple individuals.","The accused was found guilty of three counts of dangerous driving causing death, contrary to s. 249(4) of the Criminal Code, and one count of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, contrary to s. 249(3) of the Code.

He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment. The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone. The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse. He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record. The accused was at low risk to re-offend."
