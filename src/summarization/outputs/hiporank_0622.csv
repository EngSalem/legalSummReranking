He was fined $1200, with a surcharge of $120 and placed on probation for 12 months.
The sole issue on the sentence appeal is whether the trial judge erred in not ordering an unconditional discharge in the circumstances of this essentially domestic altercation.
The appellant and his spouse arrived at the Avenue Hotel parking lot in Prince Albert where they by chance encountered his spouse's former husband, John Watson.
He is a person of good character who made an error in judgment.
The offence is not one that requires an element of general deterrence to deter others.
There will therefore be an order setting aside the conviction and the determination of guilt and substituting therefore an absolute discharge.
If the fine and surcharge imposed have been paid, the sums so paid shall be remitted to the appellant.    DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 17th day of January, A.D. 1994.

3)Application by respondents (plaintiffs by counterclaim) for payment out of the monies garnisheed.
HELD: 1)Application allowed.
At the time that the applicants were served with the statement of defence and counterclaim, they were not represented by counsel nor did they know that they had to serve and file a statement of defence to the counterclaim.
However, immediately upon being served with the garnishee summons they contacted solicitors.
The application to set aside the default judgment was made as soon as possible after the judgment came to the attention of the applicants who have explained to the satisfaction of the court their failure to defend the counterclaim.
The applicants have clearly shown that they have a good defence on the merits to the counterclaim.
The applicants did not delay their application to set aside the judgment so that it cannot be argued that delay will cause irreparable injury to the respondents.
2)Application to set aside guarishee summons dismissed.
There has been strict compliance with s.3(2) of the Act.
The affidavits filed by the applicants challenging the affidavit for garnishee summons have no bearing on whether the garnishee summons should be set aside.
It is not the function of a judge to look into the merits of the case on such an application.
3)Application for payment out of monies garnisheed dismissed.
Section 14(1) of The Attachment of Debts Act provides that no order shall be made for payment out of any money paid into court by the garnishee when a garnishee summons issues prior to judgment until the plaintiff has recovered a judgment against the defendant.
Since the judgment has been set aside the application for payment out is premature and is therefore dismissed without prejudice to reapply.",[0]

[9]               Counsel for the trustee says the Zelmak, supra judgment is distinguishable from this case on the facts because the trustee there was discharged whereas here the trustee is not.
That argument supposes that it is appropriate in summary bankruptcy administration proceedings for a trustee to withhold a timely application for discharge and await a market enhancement of the value of non-exempt equity in homestead property.
I do not take Zemlak to stand for such a proposition.
On the contrary, I take it to mean that only the value of non-exempt homestead equity existing at the time of the bankrupt’s application for discharge can be attached by the trustee.
         I will make the order applied for by the applicant including the order for costs.
In so doing, I do not say that the trustee may not realize upon the value of her non-exempt equity in the homestead, but as at what date and to what extent remain open questions which can be addressed upon an application by the trustee for a discharge.

The trustee has never applied for a discharge.
The trustee did not oppose the applicant's discharge and in its report dated February 8, 1996 stated that the there were no facts, matters or circumstances that would justify the Court in refusing an unconditional order of discharge.

The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children.
They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated.
The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access.
The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister.
HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b).
The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister.
Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change.
The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister.

Unless otherwise ordered by a judge, the service and filing of a notice of appeal stays the execution of any other judgment or order pending the disposition of the appeal.
Where leave to appeal from an interlocutory order is granted, the judge hearing the application may give directions as to staying proceedings.
Where the execution of a judgment or order is stayed pending an appeal, all further proceedings in the action, other than the issue of the judgment and the taxation of costs under the judgment, are stayed unless otherwise ordered.

RESPONDENT
Mr. Hal B. Wellsch for the Appellants
The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order, an order in which it had retained jurisdiction, to confirm compliance with the order and which had been confirmed by this Court.
The original order cannot be challenged at this late date.
The Board acted within jurisdiction in hearing evidence which went to the issue of whether the appellant consulted or did not consult with the Commission and to determine whether the renovations completed by the appellant complied with the order with the result that the appellant ceased to contravene the Code.
The extent of the order, that is whether it was confined to the external access of the property or to other “facilities and services” and whether it had been complied with is the very question the Board reserved jurisdiction to determine.
In the result the appeal is dismissed with cost on double Column V.

A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant.
The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence.
The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada.
The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision.
During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations.
In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench.
This was not appealed.
An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order.
The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V.
The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services).
The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal.
The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order.
It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance.
The original order cannot be challenged at this late date.","[60, 1, 2, 59, 58, 4, 57, 3, 56, 5, 55, 6, 7, 8, 53, 52, 54]"

3.                     Since the defendant turned across the path of the Ford Tempo, and since the two vehicles came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as he was required to do by Section 50(3).
4.                     The right of way, however, is not absolute.
“the law does not require of any driver that he should exhibit perfect nerve and presence of mind, enabling him to do the best thing possible.
It does not expect men to be more than ordinary men.
Drivers of vehicles cannot be required to regulate their driving as if in constant fear that other drivers who are under observation, and apparently acting reasonably and properly, may possibly act at a critical moment in disregard of the safety of themselves and other users of the road.
But the law does insist upon a reasonable amount of skill in the handling of a vehicle which is a potential source of danger to other users of the road ... the question always is ‘What would an ordinary prudent person in the position of the plaintiff have done in relation to the event complained of?’”

The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second.
Two passengers were knocked unconscious.
One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head.
HELD: The defendant was found not guilty.
His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances.
The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield.
The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision.
It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.
 1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3).
The right of way, however, is not absolute.
As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor.
It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on.
Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor.
Alcohol was not a factor.
Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights.
3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","[2, 71, 0, 65, 17, 18, 63, 19, 61, 62, 64]"
8,"The action has been abandoned as against the defendant Ruhr, and is continued by the plaintiff against the insurer, Saskatchewan Government Insurance. FACTS          On May 11, 1993, a vehicle (hereinafter referred to as the BMW) leased to Gary Semenchuck (the ""plaintiff""), was struck from behind by a vehicle owned and operated by the defendant, Christian Ruhr.
Mr. Ruhr was solely liable for the accident.
The BMW was damaged as a result of the automobile accident.          The BMW was leased to the plaintiff from Crestview Chrysler Dodge Ltd. (""Crestview"") pursuant to a standard lease agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement, the vehicle was to be registered in the name of Crestview.
The plaintiff was listed as the ""secondary name"" on the registration.          After the accident, the plaintiff took the BMW to a Saskatchewan Government Insurance (""SGI"")
In Lepin the court chose to reduce the damages by 30%.
In light of those facts, it cannot be said that the 20% deduction for depreciation on the exhaust system is inappropriate, and as such the 20% for depreciation is allowed.
In light of the previous findings, it is not necessary for me to determine this issue.
CONCLUSION          The plaintiff's claim against SGI is dismissed with costs to be taxed.                                                             J.","A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident.
The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued.
An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found.
A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation.
The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.
SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act.
SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview.
It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event.
HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.
 1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs.
Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate.
An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate.
The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke.
On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate.
The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction.
Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate.
Estoppel was not applicable.
Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act.
The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages.
These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1).
They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4).
Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle.
As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).
 3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear.
A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.
 4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.","[252, 249, 1, 251, 3, 245, 2, 4, 6]"

Each parent seeks the custody of Sophie on the grounds that he or she is best able to meet Sophie's needs.
To review all of such evidence presented during the five-day trial would be unproductive and lead to a prolix judgment.
Therefore, I briefly propose to set out those facts necessary to provide a historical context and to deal with the distant past conduct of a party only to the extent the same is relevant to her or his ability to act as the custodial parent.
Presently, Tracy is unable to provide the degree of care and direction Sophie requires without significantly prejudicing her own development.
Accordingly, I award Lorne custody of Sophie.
It is my intention that Sophie sleeps in the same bed every night and receives one standard of consistent directions until the degree of consistency outlined by Clark and Snyder is relaxed by the Buckwold Centre.
In the first instance, I leave it to Tracy and Lorne to fix the prescribed  access dates and times having regard to Tracy's hours of work and Sophie's needs.
If difficulties arise in arranging appropriate access, either party may apply to this Court for further directions.          No costs are awarded to either party.","A decree nisi and an order granting custody to the mother was made in 1995.

HELD: Custody was awarded to the father.
1)Each parent was a capable caregiver.
However, the father was available to provide full-time care due to an employment disability and exhibited a strong desire to do so.
The past physical abuse of his former spouse was not considered relevant as it did not affect his ability to parent the child.

Original judgment has been corrected with text of addendum appended.
In due course a decision was rendered by the said Discipline Committee dismissing allegations 1, 3, 4 and 5 concerning said Dale Bonner and allegation 1 concerning said Paul Bedier.
If they are costs in the cause, then why the need for s. 51(3)?
Why is it not provided that upon receipt of a notice of appeal the executive director of LEADS shall file with the local registrar the documents referred to in s. 51(2) of the Act and shall also provide the appellant with a copy thereof, and that the costs of producing said documents shall become costs in the cause unless otherwise ordered?          I am of the view that if the Legislature had intended the costs of what is statutorily mandated to be provided to the local registrar are to be costs in the cause, the Legislature would have said so.
Absent clear and explicit language to that effect, I am of the view that I ought to hold, and do hold, that the costs of providing the statutorily mandated materials pursuant to s. 51(2) of the Act ought to be borne by, in this case, LEADS.","A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division.
The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'.
The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500.
At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
 1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach.
The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law.
None were found in either case.
The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.
 2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format.
The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case.
3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified.
Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct.
The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee.
They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act.
If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case.
In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220.
The concluding paragraph was amended to read: Subject to what has been stated in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the respondent will be entitled to recover its costs of, and incidental to this appeal, from the appellant, to be taxed on Column 3.","[1, 190, 0, 189, 188, 9]"

         Given the totality of what is before me, I do not consider a valid solicitor’s lien to have been made out.
The subsection is as follows:
... no farm land shall be sold by the sheriff under a writ of execution against the lands unless, on application by the execution creditor, the court orders that this subsection does not apply.
         Mr. Abrametz’s submission is that the end result of the seizure and sale of Barry Jensen’s shares will be a sale of farm lands.
That leave of the court must be first obtained.
I think not.
If Mr. Abrametz’s interpretation was correct, no shares of an agricultural company could be seized at all, pending leave, as they would all have some form of farm land as part of the company.
There is no such restriction in The Executions Act nor in The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act.
There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farm land.

The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares.
The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected.
At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act.
HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750.
1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted.
There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated.
2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.","[2, 165, 163, 0, 1, 162, 159, 4, 6, 3, 160, 161, 5, 7, 9, 158, 156, 157, 12, 10, 151]"

It would be unsound to base entitlement to retroactive benefits on the serendipitous signing of a collective agreement or the signing of a Board decision imposing one.
 [19]               I note, however, that at no time was the ""over 45 days"" issue raised in the proceedings before the Board, as has been noted by the union.
The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April of 2000 which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible.
The motion which brought this matter before the court for review does not raise the issue and it only came up in the briefs and in the argument before the court at the hearing of the motion.
 [20]             The two year contract has expired, the business has been sold, and to elevate this issue to the point where a rehearing would be required would seem counter productive.
Had it been an issue duly raised and argued before the Board, however, it would not have been easily ignored either by the Board or by this Court on review.
 [21]               Accordingly, the motion is dismissed.","A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees.
The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract.
HELD: The motion was dismissed.
 1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go.
The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold.
To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive.
2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review.
However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board.
The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply.
The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory.
The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses.
3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)).
4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice.
Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties.
To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference.
Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","[108, 109, 107, 106, 0, 1, 104, 105, 2, 103, 3, 5, 4]"

Judicial Centre:         Regina
Kevin Lenius threatened to kill Michelle Lenius if she did not drop the assault and sexual assault charges.
[2]            The Crown seeks to admit the two previous incidents of choking as similar fact evidence to prove issues of motive, intent and modus operandi.
The Crown also seeks to admit several hearsay statements concerning the previous incidents of assaults and threats for the truth of their contents as being relevant to the issues of motive, intent, and modus operandi.
Are the hearsay statements made by Michelle Lenius to her friends, family and co-workers admissible under the principled approach?
                                              CONCLUSION
Issues may arise however for which its probative value outweigh the potential for abuse.
That statement, except for the reference to planned and deliberate, is analogous to the case at bar.
[57]           For all the above reasons, the statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning threats and assaults will not be admitted.
[58]           Notwithstanding the above, the jury is entitled to consider the general nature of the relationship from its inception and that on occasion it was tumultuous and that the deceased left the accused and that the relationship appeared to be over.
                                                                                                   R. L. Barclay","Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife.
The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death.
In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been.
In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her.
The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi.
HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible.
The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value.
It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this.
To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value.
In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred.
The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice.
That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime.
There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice.
That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge.
There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction.
With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted.
The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify.
However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","[0, 340, 363, 362, 1, 21, 20, 361, 342, 19, 2, 25, 360]"

REASONING
Some preliminary remarks may be made regarding my general assessment of the evidence.
In assessing the evidence of the Crown witnesses I found some inconsistencies that were insignificant or explainable.
For instance there was uncertainty about the location of the Sunfire in relation to the two straight through lanes.
This was not a material fact.
I have been able to sort through any inconsistencies to find reliable and credible testimony that I accept beyond a reasonable doubt.

A stay is to be entered in the clearest of cases and when no other remedy will do.
I am able to assess the weight to be given to the Officers evidence notwithstanding the conduct complained of.
The right of the Defendant to a fair trial  has not been prejudiced by the introduction of this evidence in these circumstances.
The Charter Application for a stay of proceedings alleging a breach of fundamental justice is denied.
For these reasons, I have made the findings and reached the conclusions as hereinbefore stated under the heading, OUTCOME.
Dated at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, this 27th day of July , 2000.
S. P. Whelan","Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified.
The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light.
The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m.
After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication.
The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m.
The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m.
The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan.
The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m.
At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample.
HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant.
The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified.
The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code.
The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident.
On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.
The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial.
When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness.
This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony.
The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered.
The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice.
Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers.
The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges.
There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion.
Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate.
After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development.
stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases.
Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence.
The Charter application for a stay of proceedings alleging a breach of fundamental justice is denied.","[0, 150, 151, 260, 152, 258, 256, 259, 153, 154, 257, 10, 255, 155, 157, 254]"

It is also clear that the application for child support was made in a timely fashion.
            Weighing all of the factors, I find that there is no basis upon which s. 7 payments should be made retroactive.
I do however find that some retroactive child support is warranted based on the Tables.
As I can find no blameworthy conduct on the part of [J.C.M.], I am not prepared to award maintenance retroactive to August of 2000.
I find that retroactive child support should be fixed at $1,500.
Costs
            Rule 608 of The Queen’s Bench Rules of Court provides that costs are in the discretion of the court.
Rule 608(2) raises the presumption that a successful party is entitled to costs in a family law proceeding.
            In this case ongoing support was not an issue.
The main issues related to the s. 7 expenses and the retroactivity of the support order.
The result has been mixed and as such there shall be no order as to costs.
SUMMARY
There shall be no order as to costs.","All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old.
The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice.
The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years.
Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs.
HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act.
2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100.
There must be some justification for retroactive support orders.
This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support.
He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002.
It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court.
3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts.
There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated.
While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party.
The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties.
The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary.
Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted.
4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.","[166, 165, 0, 2, 178, 163, 1, 164, 4, 162, 161, 159, 5, 3, 6, 8, 158, 7, 167, 156, 9, 157, 154]"

All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement, which provides as follows: 
Section 14.01              RIGHT OF REFUSAL ON TRANSFERS
If a Party (denoted in this Article XIV as the ""Vendor"") shall wish to sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its Participating Interest in the Program Lands or a Project Area (herein called the ""Offered Interest"") (the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all or part of its Participating Interest) at any time during the currency of this Agreement, the other Parties hereto then having a Participating Interest in the Program Lands or Project Area affected (hereafter in this Section 14.01 called the ""Purchasers"") shall be entitled to a right of refusal in respect thereof as follows:
We conclude that the voting agreement does not constitute a sale of voting rights as contended by the appellant.
It follows that we agree with the result reached by the chambers judge.
The appeal is dismissed with costs to be taxed.","All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement.
They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause.
It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'.
HELD: Appeal dismissed orally.
The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement.
However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal.
In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets.
Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole.
Accordingly, the voting agreement is not caught by subsection 14.01.","[0, 24, 21, 46, 1, 45, 19, 2, 25, 44]"

against the Christison defendants.
The ban is not necessary
to protect the identity of the children.
The order remains in
place as to K.T., R.G.H. and W.G.H. and the boys.","Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless.
The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse.
At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports.
HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000.
Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.
 1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication.
It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports.
3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.
 4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling.
Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice.
The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice.
The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause.
5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors.
This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act.
Three reports were slanderous.
7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed.
8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive.
9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents.
The negligence claim was dismissed.
10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages.
They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.","[1520, 4, 1529, 2, 0, 1527, 6, 5, 13, 9, 14, 1515, 7, 15, 1528, 1530, 10, 3, 16, 1513, 19, 1508, 1, 1505, 1501, 17, 1500, 1526, 1524, 1507, 8, 1523, 12, 31, 27, 33, 18, 1509, 21, 1504, 1492, 35]"

There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement.
It is also clear from Duda’s evidence that Redhead was prepared to assume that risk.
         At the October 12 meeting there was no discussion as to who would be responsible for payment on work orders for repairs to the leased vehicles.
There had, however, been some payment since September 1 by Hyndman to Redhead for repairs to the vehicles.
                                                               DECISION
Contract
         On the evidence as a whole it is apparent that there was no contractual relationship between the parties, Redhead and Hyndman, with respect to the lease payments.
         There being no defence entered to the claim by Redhead against Standard and the defendant, Standard, having been noted for default, judgment is therefore given against them in the amount of the plaintiff's claim for:
(a)            damages for breach of contract for the outstanding lease payments and the outstanding parts and service account in the total amount of $63,267.49;
(b)            pre-judgment interest to be calculated from March 28, 1994, to the date of judgment pursuant to The  Pre-Judgment  Interest  Act,  S.S.  1984-85-86,  c. P-22.2;
(c)            costs of this action.","An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles.
At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993.
There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement.
It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them.
In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions.
HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs.
Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default.
Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act.
1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments.
Any verbal arrangement was never verified.
It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk.
2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.
The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.
 3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven.
Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.
 It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs.
Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","[62, 0, 36, 35, 1, 37, 2, 33, 34, 38, 60, 61, 3, 4, 31, 59]"

DANNA KOETHLER and SASKATCHEWAN JUSTICE,
THE OFFICE OF THE RENTALSMAN
Section 47(1) provides as follows:
An application for an order respecting any residential tenancy dispute may be made:
(a)     to the Rentalsman, in the form and manner that the Rentalsman may direct ....
On receiving an application pursuant to clause (1)(a) or determining pursuant to subsection (1.2) that a hearing should be held, the Rentalsman:
(c)     after holding the hearing pursuant to clause (b), may make any order the Rentalsman considers just and equitable in the circumstances including an order:
(iii)      requiring the payment of damages ....
         The definition section contained in the Act provides the following definition of a landlord:
In this Act:
(d)     “landlord” means a person who grants to a person the exclusive right of tenancy of residential premises and includes:
(i)         an agent or a personal or legal representative of, or any other person acting on behalf of, a landlord ....
         In the result, there is no error of law by the Deputy Rentalsman.
The appeal is therefore dismissed.","An appeal from a decision of the Deputy Rentalsman ordering the landlord to pay $3,414.50 to the tenant.
In issue was the jurisdiction of the Deputy Rentalsman to impose an award on the appellant who was acting as a representative for the landlord and not in his own right and who had not received notice that he was to be a named party at a hearing where an award could be made against him and who was unable to prepare and present a defence on his own behalf.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
1)The material clearly showed the appellant received notice that he was named as a party and in fact was the only party named as landlord.
An itemized list of the damages claimed was attached to the notice.
There was nothing to indicate he was unable to prepare and present a defence.
2)There was no error of law.
The definition contained in s.2(d)(ii) was considered in Lachance v. Auzano Asset which held s.2(d)(ii) was determinative of the issue.
The Act is intended to provide an informal and efficient procedure for determining landlord and tenant disputes.
This goal is facilitated by permitting such individuals as property managers to assume the role and status of landlords (Lachance).","[43, 44, 0, 52, 42, 1, 41, 40, 2, 3, 39, 4, 38, 5, 51, 37, 45, 6, 36, 7]"

                                        IN THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH
3.That the learned trial judge erred in law in failing to find that s. 11.1(3) of The Saskatchewan Regulations, to the extent that it affected the appellants’ “Aboriginal rights” and/or “Indianness”, must be read down in order to preserve its constitutionality under the doctrines of division of powers and/or interjurisdictional immunity.
The issue on this appeal is whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s. 11.1(3) of The Saskatchewan Regulations made under The Wildlife Act. 
[7]                                      Like the trial judge, I do not intend to comment on the enforcement guidelines with respect to Metis hunting and fishing rights that have been adopted by the Department of Environment and Resource Management.
It is not necessary to do so in order to dispose of this appeal.
Treaty and Aboriginal rights protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution have not been diminished by s. 11.1(3) of the Regulations.
At most the right to hunt for food in this province has been restricted by the requirement that all persons exercising that right do so in a safe manner.
The regulation applies to the appellants as hunters, not as Metis.
CONCLUSION
The appeal is dismissed.","An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting.
The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity.
The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns.
The facts were not in dispute.
The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land.
The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.
However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety.
At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code.
2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable.
There was no wrong decision on a question of law.
 3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute.
Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights.
Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights.
As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component.
The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws.
Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces.
All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test.
The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable.
Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights.
Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right.
In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied.
No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous.
The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential.
The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik.
The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).
 6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose.
Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act.
7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted.
8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement.
If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation.
It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component.
9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them.
Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary.
They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution.
The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","[0, 214, 210, 1, 209, 16, 25, 207, 50, 49, 208]"

Appeal Heard:                  March 26, 1999
Appeal Decided:               March 26, 1999 (orally)
Written Reasons:              March 31, 1999
The expenses in question related to activities such as swimming, hockey, soccer, gymnastics, snowboarding and music.
Absent any evidence to the contrary, it seems to us that the activities were ordinary activities and the expenses were of an ordinary rather than an extraordinary nature, given the income of these children’s parents.
Accordingly, the judge erred in requiring the appellant to pay a portion of them under s. 7(1)(f) in addition to the table amount fixed under s. 3(1)(a).
That portion of the judgment relating to payments under s. 7(1)(f) of the  Guidelines is set aside.
In all other respects, the appeal is dismissed.
Each party shall bear his and her own costs.

VANCISE J.A.","An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect.
The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines.
The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal.
The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children.
He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside.
1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue.
Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of.
The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed.
2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home.
3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f).
The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).
 4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.","[50, 0, 1, 49, 48, 2, 3, 47, 46, 4, 5, 45, 6, 44, 7, 43, 42, 8, 9, 10, 41, 40, 11, 12, 39]"

            The appeal from conviction is dismissed.
            The appellant also appeals the sentence which was a nine-month suspended sentence with a victim surcharge of $100.00.
He requests that this sentence be set aside and a conditional or absolute discharge granted.
Counsel for the appellant submits that the sentence should be vacated and a sentence imposed in this Court in lieu of it.
It appears that in these unique circumstances, s. 687 of the Criminal Code permits that to be done.
            At the hearing of the appeal, counsel indicated that an effort would be made  to locate a tape recording of the sentencing proceedings and arrange for it to be transcribed.
If that has occurred, I invite counsel to arrange for the Court to be reconvened for oral argument on the sentence appeal.
If the transcript is not available, I invite counsel to arrange for the Court to be reconvened to address submissions as to the applicability of s. 687 and to argue whether it is appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.","An appeal from conviction and sentence for theft of an electricity generator valued at under $5,000 contrary to Criminal Code s.334(b).
On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction.
The appellant pled not guilty.
Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction.
Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began.
Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal.
The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision.
HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.
 1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.
The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2).
2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession.
The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods.
The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft.
Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly.
There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.
 3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge.
However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines.
If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.","[0, 1, 108, 110, 107, 2, 4, 3, 109, 5, 105, 7, 103, 6, 8, 111, 104]"

ELSA SAN DIEGO
         This section of the Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty.
""Interest"" is defined in s. 237(1)(a) as ""any estate or interest in land"".
It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended, to the knowledge of the purchaser, to be part of the realty.
The Abilities Council did not have an interest in the realty that it needed to protect by notice on the title, or risk losing it, at least as against Tania and Kapronczai who had knowledge of the facts according to the trial judge.
         The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs to sell which, in my view, gives San Diego a claim for damages to which they were found entitled by the Provincial Court Judge.
And the Provincial Court Judge at the same time dismissed the claim against the third party, the Jabours, on the facts as found by the Provincial Court Judge. 
         In the circumstances, the appeal is dismissed both as it affects the plaintiff and the third party.","An appeal from Provincial Court on a Small Claim.
The Jabours, the third parties who acquired title to the house, firmly bolted a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Abilities Council by anchor bolts in a concrete slab.
The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift.
The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift.
San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party.
1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed.
It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty.
The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty.
2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.
 3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty.
Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land.
It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty.
The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs giving a claim for damages.
The Provincial Court judge dismissed the claim against the third party, the Jabours, on the facts.","[0, 53, 1, 52, 2, 51, 3, 4, 50, 49, 5, 48, 6, 47]"

He submitted first that the ignition key was not on the steering column but next to it on the dash of the vehicle.
As a result, so he argued, the attendants were mistaken about his wanting to start the vehicle.
[9]                  It is clear from the learned trial judge’s acceptance of the evidence of the ambulance attendants and that of the police officer who came along later, that he rejected the theory the appellant’s counsel advanced.
He was perfectly entitled to do so.
In my view, the location of the ignition key was not relevant, given the fact it was located somewhere on the right side of the steering wheel.
The appellant had a much different story.
He clearly accepted the evidence of the ambulance attendants and the police officer over the accused’s version of what took place.
            In my opinion, the learned trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on the evidence of the Crown witnesses to support the conviction.
            Accordingly it must stand and this appeal is dismissed.","An appeal of a conviction for having the care or control of a motor vehicle after consuming in excess of 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
It was clear from the trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the two paramedics who had noted the car parked in an unusual place and police officer who came along later, that he rejected the theory advanced by the appellant's counsel.
The location of the ignition key was not relevant.
The appellant's memory of the events was far from clear given the level of his intoxication.
The trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on the evidence of the Crown witnesses.","[0, 137, 1, 133, 3, 5, 2, 4, 136, 135, 131, 7, 6, 132, 8, 10, 9, 130, 11, 127, 128]"

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN
The offence is breach of a recognizance made under the authority of s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code, the purpose of which is to prevent further sexual offences against persons under the age of 14 years.
The breach consisted in violation of a term of the recognizance which prohibited the appellant from consuming alcohol.
The Crown admitted that there was no nexus between consumption of alcohol on the part of the appellant and his propensity to paedophilia.
In these circumstances, while we agree that a period of probation is an appropriate penalty for his offence, the inclusion of the term which prohibits him from consuming alcohol is inappropriate since it had no relation to the purpose of the original recognizance, and does not have, as far as we can see, any other purpose.
Furthermore, the term of the period of probation, three years, is out of all proportion to the nature of the offence.
The sentence is varied by reducing the term of probation to one year and by deleting the provisions concerning possession and consumption of alcohol, entry into premises where alcohol is sold and consumed, and submission to breath or blood testing.","An appeal of a sentence for a breach of recognizance made under s.810.1 of the Criminal Code, the purpose of which is to prevent further sexual offences against persons under the age of 14 years.

[1]            This is an appeal by a tenant against a decision awarding his former landlord $1,245.00.
The appeal questions the correctness of the award and the validity of the notice of the hearing.
I need deal only with the latter.
ANALYSIS
[5]            Section 60 is concerned with the method of service.
It sets out how service is to be effected and s. 60 (5.1) empowers the Rentalsman to validate a defective service provided the notice came to the attention of the person to be served.
Despite the landlord’s failure to strictly comply with s. 60(1)(a), the tenant did receive notice of the particulars of the claim and the place and time of the hearing.
It follows that in this case the tenant received only eight days notice.
He was entitled to insist on ten days notice and by denying him that period of notice the Deputy Rentalsman committed an error in law.
[9]            In the result, the appeal is allowed; the award is set aside; and it is ordered that there be a new hearing on a date to be fixed by the Rentalsman.
There will be no costs.","An appeal of an award of $1,245.
The tenant's father contacted him about the hearing while he was out of the country.
The father appeared at the hearing and objected to service of the hearing notice.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The award was set aside and a new hearing was ordered.
The Deputy Rentalsman committed an error in law by denying 10 days notice.
The Landlord and Tenant Act s.60(5.1) empowers the Rentalsman to validate a defective service provided the notice came to the attention of the person to be served.
The day the notice was received and the day of the hearing must be excluded in calculating the notice period (Interpretation Act s.24(4)).

            While the statement of Abbott C.J. reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge’s Case (1838), 1838 CanLII 1 (FOREP), 168 E.R. 1136.
This rule does not apply in the instant case for there is some direct evidence concerning the appellant’s ability to operate a motor vehicle during time frame No. 1.
See R. v. Comba, 1938 CanLII 7 (SCC), [1938]
            In my opinion the inference made by the trial judge is one that a properly instructed jury could have arrived at on the facts in the instant case and therefore should not be interfered with.
See United States of America v. Shephard, 1976 CanLII 8 (SCC), [1977]
2 S.C.R. 1067; and R. v. Mezzo, 1986 CanLII 16 (SCC), [1986]
            In summary, the trial judge made no palpable or overriding error in her assessment of the evidence, or her interpretation of the law or her application of the law to the evidence.
The appeal therefore is dismissed.","An appeal of conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (Criminal Code s.255 and s.253) on the grounds of misdirection in finding there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to impairment; an incorrect inference and failure to give correct legal effect to the facts as found including the lack of evidence of impairment at the material time while he was in care or control of the vehicle.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence.
Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence.
The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.
 2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838).
However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba).

The conviction was entered June 5, 1997, by Her Honour, Judge J.E. McMurtry of the Provincial Court.
There are two grounds of appeal, namely:     1.
Mr. Justice Tallis observed ""the need for some element of discipline with respect to s. 24(2) applications"".          The issue now raised is an important issue and impacts directly and perhaps conclusively upon the conviction of the accused.
Objections to the admissibility of the accused's statements based upon s. 7 of the Charter raise a different issue and different considerations from the application of common law principles.
There may also be a different approach to the evidence that counsel for either the accused or the Crown may adduce in the voir dire in order to establish the foundation for the Charter argument.          In the result, and particularly out of consideration for the justice of the case insofar as the accused is concerned, the appropriate approach in disposing of this appeal is that taken by the Court of Appeal in the Pelletier case directing, as it did, that a new trial be ordered.          Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the conviction set aside, and a new trial in the Provincial Court is ordered.                                             J.","An appeal of conviction on a charge of dangerous driving on the grounds the trial judge erred in holding that statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in the criminal proceedings; and in holding the statements could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police and therefore were voluntary and admissible.
The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement.
Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness.
HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered.
During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal.
Objections to the admissiblilty of the accused's statements based upon the Charter raise a different issue and considerations from the application of common law principles and a different conclusion may have been reached.","[21, 22, 1, 20, 2, 0]"

No Valid Proof of a Demand
 [23]               Marianne Fitzgerald was director of the Regina Tax Services Office, Department of National Revenue, during the time period in question.
 [46]               The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation.
It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.
The execution and serving of such a demand is purely an administrative act.
It does not require the exercise of a Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of his or her rights by restricting any right to appeal.
The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act.
The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is of no moment.
                                                             CONCLUSION
 [48]               I can find no error by the trial judge and the appeal is therefore dismissed.","An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act.
Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant.
The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection.
Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel.
There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing.
The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances.
2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party.
This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code.
Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed.
It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns.
3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326.
The appellants filed blank returns.
The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.
 It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all.
4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b).
Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage.
The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced.
Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.
 5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister.
Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing.
Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties.
The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation.
It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.
 The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.
 It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal.
The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act.
The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.","[0, 17, 1, 185, 184, 186, 183, 182, 181, 80, 78, 79, 15, 2, 179, 178, 18, 77]"

LANE J.A.","An appeal under s.33.1 of the Municipal Board Act from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board, one in a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor (MAF) to assessments for municipal tax purposes.
In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city.
HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual.
Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal.
3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed.
Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision.
The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case.
The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.

Application for DNA Warrant
s. 487.05 Criminal Code
February 27, 2002
FROM THE TRANSCRIPT:
THE COURT:                  Now, we have a number of matters, criminal matters and Small 
Claims matters to be dealt with this afternoon.
Prior to doing that, there is an application with respect to a search warrant that is to be made by the prosecutor and that ought to be made in camera, and so I’m accordingly going to direct that the courtroom be cleared.
THE COURT:                 But regardless of that side issue, it seems to me the oath is perfectly as valid taken before a commissioner or a notary as it is before me.
And I am of the view that it’s a simple matter, for example, in Form 5.01, for me to cross out, “taken before me”.
It’s nevertheless on sworn Information and it’s in accordance with the Code.
And to deal with Informations, except in emergency situations as I provided for in that protocol --
THE COURT:                 -- by way of something that’s been sworn before it gets before the judge . . . .
END OF PROCEEDINGS ON TAPE RECORDER (EDITED)","An application for a DNA warrant on the basis s.487.05 (the general warrant provision) of the Criminal Code with respect to DNA warrants does not refer to a form.
The applicant suggested a tape recording would avoid the potential problems in bringing the application before a Provincial Court Judge.
HELD: These concerns were raised in the January 21 decision concerning potential prejudicial or negative effects, which outweigh any requirement to swear the Information before a judge.
An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance.
The intention is to make protocol work as flexible as possible, not impeding the police in their legitimate role, while making sure the court maintains its independence.
Form 5.01 is specifically set out in the Code.
Section 487.1 does not have a form, but even if it did and used the same words 'taken before me', that would elevate form over substance in a significant way.","[75, 74, 9, 10, 73, 72, 12, 11, 71, 14, 13, 15, 1, 2, 5, 16, 8, 67, 17]"

The right to appeal to the Commission is contained in provisions of the Rules and the Act.
[9]               The hearing of the appeal took place before the Commission in Saskatoon on September 10, 1999.
The applicants were not given any notice as to the time and place of the hearing.
         The Commission held that the veering to the left by Cheetara and Mafia Mamma was within the tolerance of interference at the gate for two year olds and overturned the  decision of the stewards.
Consequently, Cheetara was restored to first place.
This judicial review application followed.
The relevant portions of Rule 31 are as follows:
The court went on to state that the basic principles of natural justice require that a tribunal shall be impartial and that the parties concerned shall be given an opportunity to be heard.
                                                          CONCLUSION
         The applicants are entitled to the costs of their application.","An application for a judicial review of a decision by the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Commission which held that the veering to the left by the two horses was within the tolerance of interference at the gate for two year olds.
The Commission overturned the decision of the stewards and restored the horse declared to be in first place.
In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants.
The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard.
HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed.
The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants.
1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.
 2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record.
The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.
 3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence.
The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual.
5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions.
The decision of the Commission to refuse to give the applicants notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable.
Their rights were affected by the decision.
Bibeault was distinguishable. 6)The applicants were awarded costs.","[158, 42, 0, 152, 1, 41, 40, 39, 3, 38, 4, 77, 5, 37, 151, 2]"

In addition GCB seeks an interim injunction restraining REAL from entering into any lease with Regina Central Bingo Association Inc. (""RCBA"") and preventing REAL from permitting the operation of a bingo hall by RCBA within Regina Exhibition Park except as a subtenant of GCB.                              FACTS          REAL is an agricultural exhibition association operating at Regina Exhibition Park in Regina, Saskatchewan.
FKJ subleased the Jubilee Building to GCB for the term of the lease and REAL consented in writing to this sub-lease.          GCB used the Jubilee Building to operate a bingo hall.
There will also be some inconvenience to GCB if the injunction is not granted as it wishes to ""renew"" or ""restore"" a state of affairs which has been in place for some time.
On balance GCB has failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the inconvenience it will suffer by the refusal of the injunction is greater than that which will be suffered by REAL if it is granted.          Therefore for the above reasons, and in the exercise of my discretion, I hereby dismiss the application for an interim injunction.
Costs will be costs in the cause.                                                             J.","An application for an interim injunction restraining the Regina Exhibition Association (REAL) from interfering with GCB's enjoyment of certain leasehold premises in the Jubilee Building and from entering into any lease with Regina Central Bingo (RCBA) and preventing the operation of a bingo hall by RCBA within Exhibition Park except as sub-tenant of GCB.
The original five year lease for use of the Jubilee Building as a bingo hall between Fundraising td. and REAL was assigned to GCB with REAL's written consent.
GCB further sublet the building without REAL's consent or knowledge.
Written notice of renewal was not sent to REAL.
The basis of GCB's application was estoppel on the basis that REAL entered negotiations regarding a relocation of the bingo hall and then began to deal directly with CGB's sub-tenant after the renewal date had passed.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
Costs in the cause.
1)There was no evidence that Fundraisers, the original party to the lease, attempted to exercise the option to renew.
2)GCB did not have a strong prima facie case on the merits.
It appeared that there were no negotiations between GCB and REAL.
3)There would not be irreparable harm.
Under the current arrangements, the bingo would be operated by RCBA.
If successful at trial the damages to GCB can be easily calculated based on the time it was unable to occupy the premises.
4)On balance GCB failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the inconvenience it will suffer by the refusal of the injunction will be greater than that suffered by REAL if granted.","[1, 60, 61, 59, 4, 0]"

B.C.J. No. 3056 (Q.L.) (B.C. Youth Courts), the young person refused to be represented by legal aid counsel and applied for court appointed counsel of his own choice.
He argued he ought to be able to discharge his counsel without disclosing reasons.
The court held that such a broad reading of s. 11(4)(b) of the Act was not warranted and that in the absence of a substantive reason for the discharge of his legal aid counsel the court would not appoint counsel at public expense.
The court noted such a broad interpretation begs the question as to what would occur if counsel of choice refused to act for whatever reason.
 [13]                  Here, if counsel for the young person is correct and the inquiry as to inability to obtain counsel is limited solely to financial inability some manifestly absurd results could follow.
A young person without financial assistance could, ad infinitum, disqualify himself from legal representation by his own misconduct or discharge his counsel for whatever reason and repeatedly insist on the appointment of substitute counsel.
 [14]                  Accordingly, I am of the view the learned Youth Court judge did not err in refusing to direct that the applicant have counsel appointed to him.
The application is accordingly dismissed.","An application for certiorari and mandamus.
In issue is whether the Youth Court judge has the discretion to refuse to appoint counsel to represent a young person having regard to the provisions of s.11(4) of the Young Offenders Act.
The meaning of the word 'unable' in s.11(4)(b) was in issue.
The youth was facing a variety of charges including failure to comply with conditions of an undertaking; failure to attend court; possession of property obtained by crime; obstructing a police officer.
He requested the Youth Court appoint counsel after his Legal Aid lawyer withdrew.
Both parents were on social assistance.
The matter was adjourned to investigate the possibility of an aunt providing financial assistance but the youth advised in April that she was unable to do so.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
The Youth Court judge did not err in refusing to direct counsel be appointed.
The Youth Court judge's discretion is not limited solely to considerations of financial inability.
The youth disentitled himself to continued Legal Aid representation by his own misconduct.","[65, 64, 0, 1, 63, 62, 2, 61, 3, 4, 5, 59, 6, 58, 60]"

The defendant does not allege that the settlement was amended or altered at that time.
         Once an agreement has been finalized and executed by the parties there is no further requirement for such confidentiality with respect to the concluded agreement.
If the parties had not reached a settlement agreement any reference to such discussions, admissions, disclosures, concessions, negotiations or evidence arising from any such discussion in any subsequent proceeding would be prohibited.
         The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to the minutes in his affidavit.
The affidavit makes no mention of anything said during the pre-trial conference nor of any evidence arising from anything said.
There is no reference to any oral or written admission or conversation made in the course of the settlement pre-trial conference.
He is also entitled to refer to the matters occurring subsequent to the execution of the minutes in order to establish non-compliance with the minutes.
         In the result the applicant is entitled to enter judgment for $15,000.00 together with the costs of this application.","An application for summary judgment pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184(1)(a) and/or Queen's Bench Act s.29 in accordance with the minutes of settlement agreed to follow the pre-trial conference.
The defendant did not file affidavit evidence but opposed the application solely on the basis that recent amendments to the Queen's Bench Act precludes reference to minutes of settlement.
HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to enter judgment for $15,000 plus costs of this application.
A settlement agreement reduced to writing in no way offends the confidentiality required under s.28.1.
The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to them in his affidavit.
Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to this situation.
If a party to an action is unable to enforce a concluded settlement, the pre-trial process becomes meaningless.
The legislation never intended such a result.
There was no suggestion that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settlement.
Nor was it suggested the minutes were unclear or ambiguous.
The defendant did not allege the settlement was amended or altered or that the balance of $15,000 does not remain owing.","[0, 86, 1, 84, 2, 85, 83, 4, 82, 3, 81, 5, 80, 7, 6, 78]"

The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors.
The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions.
The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm.
At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties.
HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld.
2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction.
One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.
 3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.
The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor.
Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency.
7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery.
They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants.
8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice.
Notes prepared by the accountant and the interoffice communications summarizing discussions with the solicitor also fell within the scope of privilege.","[152, 149, 6, 3, 151, 2, 150]"

[1]            This is an application by the City of Saskatoon and William Hewitt (the ""third parties"") to strike out the third party claim on the basis that it does not disclose a reasonable cause of action.

[5]            Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules provides:
173      The Court may at any stage of an action order any pleading or any part thereof to be struck out, with or without leave to amend, on the ground that:

[28]           Costs of these application shall be costs in the cause.","An application to strike out the third party claim as not disclosing a reasonable cause of action.
The plaintiffs brought a claim in contract and tort alleging Hagblom caused a fire in their building.
The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation.
The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence.
In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
Leave was granted nunc pro tunc to bring third party proceedings.
(1)The third party claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action.
It was not plain and obvious the claim could not succeed.
It was arguable on the pleadings that the third parties did not act in good faith in that it was alleged they deliberately set out to suppress information and destroy evidence.
(2)The statutory limitations will not nullify the third party claim if the allegations relevant to the contention that the third parties did not act in good faith are proven.","[0, 122, 1, 18, 119, 19, 17, 31, 2, 38, 37, 20, 118, 36, 116, 39, 16, 3, 40]"

possible throughout the appeal process.
Although the previous
disruptions in the child's schooling were not caused by any action of
the father, in our opinion a further dislocation in the child's living
arrangements and schooling would have been detrimental to the child.

This appeal is from judgment of Maurice J. under The Matrimonial Property Act, R.S.S. 1985, c. M-6.1.
The main issue is whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty- three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated.
The following excerpts from his judgment give the background facts, his reasoning leading to the disposition and the disposition itself:
The wife, age 50, and the husband, age 50, were married October 8, 1988.
They lived together until February 1, 1991, when they commenced living separate and apart under the same roof.
The wife left the matrimonial home on March 21, 1992, and commenced proceedings for divorce and division of matrimonial property on May 14, 1992. . . .
The appeal is allowed to the extent referred to above.
In all other respects, it shall be dismissed.

Appeal from a judgment directing matrimonial property.
The main issue was whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated.
The couple's marriage had lasted less than four years.
HELD: The QB judgment was upheld regarding the severance package.
The severance package was not a reward for past service; it was for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination.
The severance package was based on future earnings, which would have occurred within the duration of the marriage.
The QB judge did however fail to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give the husband his one-half share of them.

RESPONDENT
Lawrence W. Diduck on his own behalf
Lane Wiegers for the Crown
He alleges he was seriously assaulted and injured during one of those encounters at his home.
He testified that he had filed a number of formal complaints against the members of the RCMP and that these were being investigated.
In these circumstances - for these reasons, he testifies his purpose and intent in the messages overall was to be left alone; it was not his purpose and intention to be threatening.
Your defence, such as it was, was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it.
Since your defence was fully and fairly put, it cannot be said that you did not have a fair trial.
As to the appeal against sentence, since the sentence was limited to time already served by you while awaiting trial, it is now moot: that is, there is no issue to be decided.
Were we to rule upon its fitness, we would have no difficulty in finding it fit.
The appeals against both conviction and sentence are dismissed.","Appeals of sentence and conviction on the grounds the transcripts of court proceedings were not available; the court would not subpoena certain witnesses on his behalf; his state of mind when he made the telephone calls exonerated him.
HELD: The appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed.
The judge made no error in ruling that all of the evidence from the prospective witnesses and transcripts was irrelevant as being unrelated to the charges and too remote in time.
The appellant's state of mind was adequately established by his own evidence and the summation to the jury.
The defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it.
The sentence appeal was moot since it was limited to time served while awaiting trial.
The Court would have found the sentence to be fit in any event.","[1, 35, 2, 34, 3, 33, 4, 32, 31, 5, 6, 30, 7, 8, 28, 9, 27]"

The facts have been completely set out in the decision of Kovach J. dated April 26, 2000, Q.B. 127/98.
In my view the applicant misconstrues the mortgage agreement.
The monies paid by the applicant’s father as a result of a separate transaction were applied by Farm Credit Corporation to release the father’s land which had been provided to Farm Credit Corporation as accommodating security only.

I am satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to abridge the time and order the assessment.
         In referring this matter for assessment, I am not suggesting that the bill rendered by Mr. Morrison in this case was inappropriate and/or excessive.
         As a result, there shall be an order pursuant to s. 67 of The Legal Profession Act, 1990, supra, as amended:
(1)         that Mr. Morrison’s bill be assessed by the local registrar of the Court of Queen’s Bench at the Judicial Centre of Saskatoon, or his deputy, at a time and place to be fixed by him;
(2)         the local registrar of the Court of the Queen’s Bench at the Judicial Centre of Saskatoon or his deputy, is hereby directed to,
(a)      assess the costs
(b)      certify the amount that the local registrar, or his deputy, may determine to be due from each party with respect to the bill and the costs of the assessment.

A Registrar may assess any bill for legal services, provided that the application is filed within 30 days or more if a judge makes a discretionary order to extend the period for assessment if it is in the interests of justice to do so.
The issue if whether the applicant's two bills fall with the said 30 days or if this is a case where it is appropriate to abridge the time for allowing an assessment.
HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment.
The bills were issued in two separate matters.
In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue.
There will be no extension of time for the first bill.
The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it.
He was advised that the bill would be adjusted.
An initial adjustment was made and when still not satisfied, ongoing discussions about the bill continued.
The Court held that the last document received by the applicant was not the final bill as it was still subject to change.

BETH BILSON, Q.C.
2.2           Academic Freedom – General Policy Statement
Academic freedom is essential to the teaching, research, scholarship and community development functions of the University.
The University will defend the academic freedom of members from interference from any source; however, the University will not be held accountable for infringements of academic freedom originating beyond the control of the University.
The Board interpreted these provisions as imposing a positive obligation upon the University and its officers to defend and promote the exercise of academic freedom by faculty members and then went on to consider what happened at the Board of Governors meeting on April 12.
Thus it reached the conclusion which I have already quoted.
         In effect, the Board of Arbitration found that Mr. Watson’s conduct at the Board of Governors meeting did not comport with the requirements of Articles 2.1 and 2.2 of the Collective Agreement.
In my judgment, the reasons as a whole support that finding.
The decision meets the reasonableness test.
         The application is dismissed with costs.
                                                                                                                            C.R. Wimmer","Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties.
The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom.
The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved.
After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn.
The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention.
When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member.
No decision was reached at that meeting.
The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer.
The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement.
Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom.
HELD: The application is dismissed with costs.
The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement.
The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test.
The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement.
The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly.","[95, 94, 0, 93, 1, 92, 2, 3, 90, 4, 91, 5, 6, 7, 89, 88, 87, 8, 86]"

December 15, 1998 [1]
Associates applies under s. 63 of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by Associates and Humboldt in two reefer trailers.
It also applies for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest.
When the application came before me in chambers, the parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focussed their submissions solely on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s. 66.
This is an          important feature of the system because it          is very easy for a creditor to take and          perfect a security interest in all of a          debtor`s present and after-acquired          property.
The application of Associates is allowed.
It is ordered that its purchase-money security interests in the two reefer trailers have priority to Humboldt`s security interests in them.
Associates is entitled to its costs from Humboldt.                                                             J.","Associates, which held purchase money security interests pursuant to its 1997 leases, applied under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by Associates and Humboldt Flour Mills in two reefer trailers.
Humboldt's security interests were acquired pursuant to a security agreement granted in 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in 1998 to specifically include the trailers.
It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest.
At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers.
HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.
 1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a).
What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute.
Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession.
Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession.
S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34.
4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'.
5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease.
Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date.
Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada.
Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.
 6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly.
To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.","[1, 125, 2, 123, 124, 3, 121, 0]"

-the Plaintiff
SYDIA BROS. ENT. LTD. and MARVIN PROCYSHYN
The cause of the accident under this scenario was the plaintiff ‘cutting’ in front of  the defendant’s tractor.
The only material difference in the testimonies proffered by the plaintiff, the defendant and the defendant’s wife concerning the circumstances at the scene of the accident was the presence or absence of a half-ton truck in front of the plaintiff’s vehicle when the collision occurred.
This is an important difference because if there were a vehicle in front of the plaintiff’s vehicle at the time of the accident then this would lend credence to the view that the collision occurred as a result of the plaintiff ‘cutting in front of the tractor’.
I must say that I found all of the witnesses to be quite believable; each witness to the actual occurrence actually believed that what they were relating was a true and correct version of the facts as they perceived them to have transpired.
This is one of those rare cases were the scales of justice are evenly balanced.
The scales do not weigh persuasively in the favor of either the plaintiff or the defendant based upon the oral evidence given by the witnesses who testified at the trial.
On this basis, as a matter of law, the plaintiff’s claim must be and is hereby dismissed with no order as to costs to either party.
                                    _________________________T. WHITE, PCJ","At issue in the negligence suit was whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff's vehicle in front of him and stopped his vehicle to avoid the motor vehicle collision.
The only material difference in testimonies was whether there was a half-ton truck in front of the plaintiff's vehicle when the collision occurred.
HELD: The plaintiff's claim was not proven on a balance of probabilities.
The physical evidence did not assist and the court was unable to conclude that one version was correct and the other incorrect.","[43, 52, 51, 44, 4, 42, 5, 41, 39, 6, 40]"
52,"While the liability of John to pay maintenance for the children is not disputed, the parties were not fully agreed on the quantum thereof, which requires a determination of John's income.
Mary was 18 years old at the time and John was 21.
2.That Mary Helene Haley shall have sole custody of the children, Chelsea Haley and Courtney Haley, and John Cameron Haley shall have reasonable access to the said children upon reasonable notice.
3.That John Cameron Haley shall pay Mary Helene Haley child maintenance in the sum of $600.00 per month per child (total $1,200.00 monthly) for the two children, the said amount to be paid on the first day of each and every month commencing on October 1, 1995, and continuing for as long as the said children remain children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 4.That John Cameron Haley shall pay Mary Helene Haley spousal maintenance in the sum of $800.00 per month on the first day of each and every month commencing on October 1, 1995, and continuing up to and including June 1, 2001. 5.In order to finalize the division of matrimonial property:          (a)That each party shall retain for his or her own use and benefit the household items and personal effects previously distributed.          (b)That the 1,000 shares in the Yorkton Restaurant Venture Capital Corporation be divided equally between the parties.          (c)That John Cameron Haley pay Mary Helene Haley a lump sum of $5,340.00 within 60 days of this order.          (d)That there shall be a spousal rollover in the sum of $62,350.00 from John Cameron Haley's R.C.M.P. pension plan in the name of Mary Helene Haley. 6.That Mary Helene Haley shall have her costs to be taxed against John Cameron Haley, including one-half of the costs for the preparation of the reports and pension valuations by Cara L.

HELD: 1)The respondent's supplementary allowances were taken into consideration in finding a gross salary of $53,000.00 per annum.
Due to an injury he was no longer able to work overtime but was working full-time.
Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage.
The frequent moves due to the husband's employment had disrupted the petitioner's employment and university education.
However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse.
3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage.
Shares in joint names were divided equally.
Other assets were divided equally.
4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits.
The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date.
The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner.
5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income.
$600.00 per month per child was awarded.
 6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse.
The petitioner's future plans were realistic.
$800 per month until June 1, 2001 was awarded for spousal support.

[1]            At issue on this application is the interim custody of Keanna Marie James (Ross), child of the petitioner Christine James and the respondent Ryan Ross (Rollheiser) and, child support.
                        INTERIM CUSTODY BACKGROUND FACTS
I will also say that the mutual love and acceptance demonstrated by the families and relatives of each party, along with the overall concern for the best interests of the child, is self-evident and commendable.
                         INTERIM CUSTODY LAW AND ANALYSIS   
[8]            The purpose of an interim custody order is to give a person the right and duty to care for a child until a permanent order or another interim order is made.
[16]           Accordingly, there will be the following order:
(a)     The petitioner shall have interim custody of Keanna Ross (James);
(b)     The respondent shall have reasonable access including every second weekend, reasonable telephone access and reasonable access during holiday periods.
                                     INTERIM CHILD SUPPORT
[17]           The respondent, on October 15, 2003, was ordered to file year to date income information.
The respondent shall pay his proportionate share of childcare costs (being 82.5%) in the amount of $103.00 per month commencing with $206.00 payable forthwith for October and November, 2003 and a like amount on the first day of each month thereafter until further order.
[20]           The petitioner shall have costs of her application.","At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support.
HELD: Interim custody was given to the petitioner with access to the respondent.
The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month.
On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo.","[0, 104, 96, 12, 1, 13, 97, 95, 2, 11, 94, 33, 34, 14, 32, 93, 103]"
54,"The appellants alleged two insufficiencies in the evidence: (i)""The absence of any expert evidence that the injuries sustained by Musam Musleh [the victim-complainant] resulted from any blows such as kicks or punches and as such were the result of an assault.""
In short, they contended that the Crown failed to prove that an offence of assault, or indeed an offence of any kind, had been committed. (ii)""The absence of any evidence that the Appellant[s] delivered any blows to [the victim]"".
In short, they contended that the Crown failed to discharge the burden of proving identity.      As well, the appellants alleged an error of law by ""convicting . . . on circumstantial evidence, when other reasonable explanations existed"".      In our respectful view the appellants failed on all three of those submissions.      As to the  need for expert evidence to pinpoint the cause of the injuries suffered by the victim, the question is readily resolved by examining the circumstances immediately preceding the infliction of the injuries, by the description of the injuries given by the victim, (who, although he did not remember how the injuries were inflicted, had a very good recollection of their nature) by looking at the photographs of the victim taken the following day, by the opinions of both the counterman at the 7-Eleven store who saw the victim shortly after the injuries were inflicted and called the police, and of the investigating officer who saw the victim shortly after that.
The officer testified:
The traditional entitlement to present argument to a judge sitting without a jury last, however, is a procedural entitlement to which the curative provision contained in s. 686(1)(b)(iv) applies.
We would be prepared to invoke that curative provision in this instance.
In summary, we find that the verdict is not unreasonable, that it can be supported by the evidence, and that the judge made no error of law.
In the result the appeal is dismissed.","At trial in Provincial Court, the accuseds called no evidence and were convicted.
They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance.
2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds.
3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.","[42, 41, 40, 2, 1, 39, 4, 3]"

Appeal Heard:                  16 February 1998
Appeal Allowed:               06 March 1998      
Both parties agreed the test is set out in R. v. Redpath Industries Ltd. et al. (1984), 84 D.T.C. 6349 at p. 6351:
A criminal court is not the forum to determine income taxability and to make determinations as to rights to tax assessment or absence of rights of assessment involved.
In a tax evasion charge, it must appear prima facie from the evidence that the taxability is clear-cut, obvious, indisputable, unquestionable from lack of reporting, before entering the examination of the other facts of the charge, e.g. whether the undisputable taxability, based on income gained, proven and undeclared, leads to a conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that it was wilfully omitted by a taxpayer in his tax returns.
The evidence of taxability was not clear-cut, obvious or indisputable.
On the material before us there is no basis prepared to overturn the findings of fact made by the trial judge.
See R. v. Andres, 1979 CanLII 2238 (SK CA), [1982]
The appeal is therefore allowed and the acquittals ordered by the trial judge are restored.

         In terms of s. 7 expenses, the respondent's proportionate share is 80 percent.
With respect to any expenses in this regard not covered by student loans, the respondent shall pay his proportionate share of such expense within 30 days of such funds being due.
Section 7(3) of the Guidelines requires that any tax deduction or credit relating to a covered expense be taken into account.
In this instance, the issue is the education tax credit available to the children.
Any unused portion can be transferred to a parent.
This only becomes an issue if the respondent is required to contribute to his children's education expense pursuant to s. 7.
If the respondent is required to so contribute and if there is any unused tax credit available to either child, such credit should be transferred to the parents in proportion to their respective incomes.
If the parties are unable to work out an adjustment, an application may be made to the court for adjustment.
         The petitioner shall have her costs of the application fixed in the amount of $750.00.","Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278.
He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time.
The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies.
He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit.
The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time.
Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans.
The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans.
At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001.
HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines.
Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act.
They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents.
It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a).
The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees.
The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs.
The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay.
Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month.
The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.
 3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance.
The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2).
A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald.
It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget.
To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency.
4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due.
If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.","[217, 2, 218, 220, 219, 0, 1, 215, 216, 3, 5, 4, 214, 6, 213, 7, 8, 211]"

[1]                              The plaintiff, Coachlight Resources Ltd. (""Coachlight"") and the defendant, Duce Oil Ltd. (""Duce"") are corporations engaged in the recovery of petroleum and natural gas substances.
This action relates to a horizontal well drilled by the parties on LSD 3 of 33-6-9-W2 (the ""Horizontal Well"" or the ""Well"").
The Horizontal Well was drilled from an existing vertical well in which Coachlight held a 65% interest and Duce held a 35% interest.
The plaintiff  invoiced the defendant for its share of expenditures for the Horizontal Well but the defendant refused to pay the whole amount.
The Court therefore finds that Coachlight is only entitled to the CAPL 1981 interest from its notice of June 20, 1994.
All petroleum, natural gas and other hydrocarbons except coal and valuable stone within, upon or under:

INITIALS:         pw","Coachlight sought an order requiring the defendant to pay the balance of its 35% share of $681,955.58 as costs for drilling a petroleum/natural gas well plus $49,701.61 representing its 35% share of the lifting and production costs under the Operating Agreement.
The plaintiff also sought a declaration that it holds builders' liens against the defendant's interest in the Well and other joint interest assets to the extent of the debts due.
Duce Oil denies liability for any costs of the horizontal well in excess of $447,535 being 110% of the authorization for expenditure executed with respect to the Well.
The defendant counterclaimed on the basis the plaintiff conducted certain operations without authority, was negligent in conducting operations and overcharged or made improper charges in its accounting procedures.
HELD: 1)Duce was liable for $96,286.95 representing 35% of the unpaid costs of the original and supplemental authorization for expenditures (AFE) and the costs of the screw pump.
2)Duce was responsible for $49,701.61 representing regular lifting and production costs and other joint interest wells plus expenditures under $25,000 which did not require an AFE.
3)Coachlight was only entitled to interest from the time of its written notice on June 20/94 that it was exercising its option under the CAPL 1981 to charge interest.
4)In default of payment within 90 days of Judgment the plaintiff would be entitled to a builders' lien in the entire estate or interest of the defendant in all petroleum, natural gas and other hydrocarbons except coal and valuable stone, upon or under the lands as specified together with all proceeds from the defendant's interests in petroleum and natural gas and its interest in fixtures, machinery, tools, appliances and other property in any of the defendant's oil or gas wells on those lands.

[1]                  Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in this proceeding, there are questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that require resolution before the parties can put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown.
The father was unrepresented at trial with the unfortunate result that these proceedings became an extended replay of past domestic arguments.
[2]                  The parties were married on May 22, 1982 and had three children:
[T.B.D.], born […], 1985;
[M.M.D.], born […], 1987; and
[L.C.D.], born […], 1991.
            The respondent also had renters in the house in 1998 who have sporadically paid him rent or given him gifts such as a $680 stereo, in lieu of rent.
The net after-tax cost of day care has also not been calculated.
The petitioner is not precluded from returning that issue, on more comprehensive evidence.
Likewise, the respondent is not precluded from having a review of his maintenance obligation conducted if he produces the necessary income information.
            There will be a judgment for divorce, to be made final on the expiration of thirty-one days.
            The petitioner will have her costs of the proceedings, to be taxed.","Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute.
The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997.
The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100.
He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home.
He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share.
The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence.
He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home.
HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother.
The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend.
2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited.
The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed.
The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent.
The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.'
The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate.
The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report.
3)The property was to be sold.
The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home.
A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour.
Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds.
4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father.
RRSP's were to be divided equally.
Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party.
Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father.
The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred.
No repayments had been made in 10 years.
The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility.
5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect.
The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory.
Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income.
No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof.
The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced.
6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","[2, 0, 1, 310, 307, 5, 309, 8, 4, 6, 308, 7, 9, 3, 10, 14, 12, 15, 16, 305, 13, 11, 298]"

J. Plemel, Q.C.                                                                                    for the Crown
M. Brayford, Q.C.                                                                                          for the Accused
Evidence obtained though a process of self-incrimination will generally be excluded in order to ensure that the accused has a fair trial.
The fair trial test tends more towards an absolute rule of exclusion because courts are instructed not to concentrate on the motives behind the Charter violation.
Of course, the rule is different if we are dealing with “real” evidence.
That being the case I have concluded that even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused’s rights, they were nevertheless violated.
Because the result of that violation was that there were statements made that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements.
Therefore, all of the statements of the accused including those made after the arrest are excluded and will not form part of the Crown’s case.
The result of the voir dire is that none of the statements of the accused will be admissible in evidence in this trial.
Dated at Saskatoon this 27th June 2007.","Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.'
The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers.
The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample.
The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood.
During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information.
The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions.
The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand.
The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police.
The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law.
HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case.
The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive.
The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights.
He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act.
He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute.
Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated.
Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements.
The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act.
As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial.
As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","[78, 1, 79, 77, 76, 2, 3, 75, 4, 5, 74, 6, 72, 8, 7, 73]"

[1]               The accused, Michael Pesenti, is charged that on or about August 9, 2009, at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, he did: 
b) operate a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug and did thereby cause bodily harm to Neil Honatzis, contrary to s. 255(2) of the Criminal Code.
[2]               He came before me for preliminary inquiry on these charges on July 26, 2010.
After the Crown had called all of their witnesses on the preliminary inquiry, I asked Defence Counsel if they had any witnesses to call on behalf of the accused.
[28]           Therefore I grant the Defence request for an adjournment so that they can make the necessary arrangements to call Sergeant Barbar as a witness for the Defence in this preliminary inquiry.
At this time, I see no need to deal with the Defence request to be able to cross-examine Sergeant Barbar when he appears as their witness.
In my view, Sergeant Barbar is being called as a Defence witness
and as such can be examined-in-chief by Mr. Owens.
If a situation arises in the course of his examination that creates a basis for Mr. Owens to make an application to cross-examine Sergeant Barbar then we will deal with it at that time.
D.E. Labach, J","Defence sought an adjournment of a preliminary hearing to call a police accident reconstructionist as a witness.
Prior to the commencement of the hearing, defence counsel was aware that the Crown did not intend to call this person as part of its case.
One month prior to the preliminary hearing, defence counsel requested that the accident reconstructionist be made available as witness.
The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission.
The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing.
HELD: The defence request for an adjournment was granted.
The Court could not be satisfied that the officer was not a material witness to the preliminary inquiry.
The Court was not satisfied that defence was guilty of neglect in failing to procure the officer's attendance when they had been advised by the Crown that he was out of the country.

Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit.
          Counsel for the appellants argues that the sentencing judge did not take Alsager’s rehabilitation into consideration.
Given these types of offences, that is not an error of law.
Counsel also suggests that the consecutive offences for Alsager’s handling of the 36 elk ought to have been concurrent offences.
Because I find the overall sentence to be appropriate,  I cannot interfere with the sentence on this basis, even if I agreed with counsel’s submissions.

A. R. Rothery","DIGEST
The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors.
The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000.
HELD: 1)
The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents.
The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public.
The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry.
This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.
 2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000.
The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high.
Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'.

EDWARD JAMES HERBERT LANG
         I have considered and rejected arguments that involved a calculation of the precise value of the personal properties because the evidence I had was not reliable and there was an appearance of equality as noted above.
I have also accepted the claim that Edward’s house, jointly owned with his mother as protection “in case he meets someone” is exempt property.
I have rounded some of the numbers and ignored the fact that the mortgage on the matrimonial home was reduced by about $10,000.00 during the period in question.
Both parties had the benefit of the matrimonial home during the marriage.
         It is to the credit of Edward that at trial he conceded that his claim for 50% of the equity was perhaps unfair (i.e. inequitable) and that 25% would do.
As well he was prepared to extend the time for payment.
However the claim was, in its entirety, inequitable and had he not filed a counter petition there would have been no division, no trial and no excessive legal costs because the petition made no property claims whatever.
I therefore direct that there shall be judgment in favour of Sharon Lang for $1,945.00 plus an award of costs of $5,000.00 for a total of $6,945.00.","Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue.
The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months.
HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000.
The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances.
However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case.
The home was to remain in the petitioner's name.
It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage.
Five of those children still lived with her in the home.
The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage.
2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed.
One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax.
The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","[0, 1, 2, 54, 53, 3, 52, 51, 4, 50, 5, 49, 48, 6, 7, 47]"

JUDGMENT              DICKSON,J DATE: January 8, 1986 
I granted a decree dissolving the parties' marriage at trial and reserved judgment on the issues of maintenance, costs and division of matrimonial property.
Because matrimonial property has been divided equally, the applicant abandons her claim for spousal maintenance but the respondent must bear his share of the cost of maintaining his children.
Payment of the sum of $74,620.00 plus interest thereon shall be secured by a charge upon the folowing lands:
MINERALS IN THE CROWN. 
Should a periodic payment of the said sum be in arrears for more than 30 consecutive days, the remaining sum owing shall become immediately due and payable and in such even the applicant shall have leave to apply for an order of judicial sale of the said land to satisfy payment of the remaining sum.
The applicant shall recover her costs of $500.00 and the respondent shall pay her an additional sum of $512.50 to cover one-half the cost of appraising the real property.

The appellant, Dr. Huerto (""Huerto""), has been reassessed and ordered to pay $384,635.44.          The grounds of appeal can be summarized as follows: [1]The committee did not have jurisdiction to enter into the investigation of Huerto. [2]Huerto had a reasonable apprehension of bias in respect of Dr. Orchard as a member of the committee.
[3]The committee committed an error of law and misinterpreted the empowering legislation and their duty under that legislation.
[4]The committee exceeded its jurisdiction by basing its decision on irrelevant considerations and thereby abused its discretion and further acted on inadequate materials.
Furthermore, Huerto provided the Committee with a lengthy and detailed economic analysis in an attempt to show the Committee that his method of frequency of patient contacts and testing was more economical than cardiologists who had hospital privileges.
There is no question but that it is acceptable for the Committee to examine billing patterns and to review how the pattern of one physician differs from another physician or group of physicians.
The Committee had a hearing to give Huerto the opportunity to explain the deviations it observed in his billing pattern as compared to a group of physicians.
The Committee did not decline or exceed its jurisdiction and did not commit an error of law.
Accordingly, there is no basis for interfering with the decision of the Committee and the appeal is dismissed.                                                             J.

She seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that Mr. Marzolf’s income is significantly higher than $110,000.00.
On the same basis she also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls.
Retroactive Variation
The objectives of the Guidelines are set forth in s.1 which states:
The objectives of these Guidelines are
(a)  to establish a fair standard of support for children that ensures that they continue to benefit from the financial means of both spouses after separation;
(b)  to reduce conflict and tension between spouses by making the calculation of child support orders more objective;
This results in child support payable for two children from January 1, 2003 to June 30, 2003 of $1,878.00 per month and the sum of $1,186.00 for one child for each month during the balance of the year.
Based on and as a result of the foregoing, the parties should be able to determine the shortfalls in child support paid by Mr. Marzolf during each year and calculate the amount now owing to Ms. Marzolf.
Any mathematical errors in the computations made herein may be corrected with the agreement of the parties failing which they should be brought to my attention.
[27]         Ms. Marzolf is entitled to her costs of this application which are hereby set at $2,600.00 which costs shall be paid forthwith.","Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999.
The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month.
The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000.
The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley.
The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school.
The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000.
She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls.
HELD: 1)
The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay.
In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return.
The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income.
To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding.
The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years.
The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2)
The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922.
This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources.
It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount.
Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income.
This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376.
However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424.
The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410.
It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003.
This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952.
Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.
 3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345.
It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent.
In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support.
Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.
 4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003.
In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes.
The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003.
Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so.
She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support.
Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.
 5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract.
Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed.
6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted.
No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment.
Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year.
The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7)
In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410.
Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8)

CYPRESS REGIONAL HEALTH AUTHORITY,
I do not believe the defendants to have contended otherwise.
         I find that it is not appropriate for me to grant an injunction requiring the defendants to make the required retroactive assessment payments before the end of 2010.
Neither do I see any reasonable prospect of a solution to the problem by making payments on a “best approximation” of entitlement.
That is a viable solution to the problem.
I am not persuaded that it can be done by an earlier time than fully compiled payments.
In the long run the results of such a solution are likely to be troublesome and chaotic.
         As to the alternative of directing an expedited arbitration and appointing an arbitrator to conduct it, I am of the view that I am without jurisdiction to do that.
         The defendants’ motion is dismissed.
The plaintiffs’ motion is dismissed.
I appreciate the thorough research and able submissions of counsel.
I will entertain submissions as to costs if counsel so request.
                                                                                                      J.D. KOCH   ","Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement.
The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year.
This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates.
In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration.
The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.
HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme.
The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed.
While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case.
While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages.
It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations.
It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation.
The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","[102, 0, 103, 2, 101, 100, 1, 99, 3, 97, 6, 4, 5, 96, 7, 95, 94, 93, 92, 91, 8]"

March 27, 1995          This is an application for judicial review of a unanimous arbitration award by a three-person panel dated December 1, 1994 which reinstated the respondent Cumming as an employee of the applicant.          The parties, including the respondent Union had entered into a ""mutual agreement"" dated January 12, 1993 which was a back-to-work agreement for the respondent grievor following his termination as an employee on October 1, 1992.
THE AWARD i)  Facts Found By The Board          The respondent grievor commenced his employment with the applicant on October 5, 1970.
To the extent the Board concluded that it was not ""prepared to accept that the August 14, 1993 incident amounted to a culminating incident""
I interpret this to mean that taking into account the grievor's absence from work on August 14, 1993, together with his previous employment record, the appropriate penalty was not discharge.
This it was entitled to do.          The application is dismissed with one set of costs to the respondents.                                                             J.","FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee.
The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer.
The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction.
The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination.
The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'.
The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay.
HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable.
If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness.
3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise.
The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness.
4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule.
The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct.
5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.","[86, 85, 84, 3, 0]"

September 30, 1994            The accused applicant applies for a review of the terms of his judicial interim release.
Although he has referred to his Charter rights in his application, he acknowledges that the required notice has not been given and that he is not seeking a Charter remedy.
He declined an adjournment to enable him to bring a Charter application and with the co-operation of the Crown, copies of the record were produced and filed with the court to enable the accused's review hearing under s. 520 of the Code to proceed.            The accused is charged with four counts of defamatory libel under ss. 300 and 301 of the Code.
I have come to this conclusion on a consideration of the nature of the offences with which the accused has been charged, on the circumstances surrounding the alleged commission of the offences, on the accused's stated intention to continue picketing, and on his view of what is lawful activity.
The application is denied and the existing order stands.                            _________________________________J.","FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel.
The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place.
He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial.
He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully.
HELD: Application dismissed.
Amendment refused.
If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges.
The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.","[13, 0, 1, 12, 2]"
73,"The applicant argues that his constitutional rights and his right to make full answer and defence have been infringed by the refusal of the respondent to provide full and complete disclosure without trust conditions and undertakings being imposed thereon.
It is important to note that the applicant contends not for less onerous trust conditions or undertakings, but that disclosure be without trust condition or undertaking of any sort.          The Crown maintains that the trust condition or undertaking required is appropriate in the circumstances of this case.
The affidavit of the applicant, among other things, states that his counsel is unable to give him copies of certain disclosure material to enable him to review and study it on his own as he wishes and feels it necessary to do.
CONCLUSION          I find that evidence does not show how disclosure, on the trust condition in question, would prevent the applicant from making full answer and defence to the charges he faces.
I find that the interest of the public and the complainants in having the statements and videotapes narrowly disseminated is clearly shown.
The conditions apply only to victim's statements, videotapes and references to victim's statements - obviously matters of some sensitivity.
The Crown is not withholding disclosure.
The information contained in those statements and videotapes is available to the accused and retained experts for use in preparing his defence.
The accused will know the substance of the complaints and, therefore, the case he has to meet.","FIAT The accused, who was charged with two counts of sexual assault involving complainants 15 and 13 years of age, applied for a remedy under ss.24(1) of the Charter of Rights compelling the respondent to provide full disclosure to him, without trust conditions or undertakings of any sort.
HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter.
The obligation to disclose is not absolute.
The Corwn's obligation to protect the privacy of the complainants is fulfuilled by providing the statements and videotapes to counsel for the accused on trust condition that counsel retain them in his possession.
The information contained therein is available to the accused and retained experts for use in preparing his defence.
Since the accused knows the sustance of the complaints and, therefore, the case he has to meet, there is no danger to the fairness of the trial by virtue of the trust condition attached to disclosure.
The public interest is served and the integrity of the criminal justice system is maintained when complainants are assured that staements and videotapes will not be reproduced.

In the end the adjournment was granted.
The matter of costs was reserved to me.
Taking into account the circumstances of the earlier appearance, I order that the defendants will have the costs of that adjournment in any event of the cause and I fix those costs at $200.00.
CONCLUSION          It is hereby ordered as follows: (1)that the defendants shall produce to the plaintiffs the documents described in paras.
3 of their statement of defence to counterclaim by setting forth the nature and source of the alleged shortfalls and deficiencies along with the monetary value of same; (4)that the defendants shall have costs in the amount of $200.00 in any event of the cause.","FIAT The Plaintiffs purchased a Robin's Donuts franchise from the Defendants.
They later tried to sell the franchise without success.
Eventually they turned the franchise back and sued for damages alleging that the Defendants had interfered in their attempts to sell the franchise and had wrongfully refused to consent to a sale negotiated by the Plaintiffs.
The Defendants counterclaimed for unpaid royalties and rent.
The parties each prepared and served their Statements as to Documents.
Both parties then applied for production of additional documents under Rule 212.
The Defendant also sought further particulars of certain matters referred to in the Plaintiff's Defence to Counterclaim under Rule 164.
HELD: Applications allowed.
Both of the parties were ordered to produce some of the documents requested.
1)A party must disclose all documents which may contain information which either directly or indirectly enables the other party to advance his case or to damage the case of his adversary.
 2)The test of relevance on discovery is wider than that of admissibility at trial. 3)Documents brought into existence with the dominant purpose of using them in order to obtain legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation which is in reasonable prospect at the time of their creation are privileged. 4)Particulars are appropriate only (i)to enable a party to properly plead in response or (ii)to eliminate surprise.
5)The Court found that further particulars were appropriate in this case on the second ground, given the vague nature of the impugned paragraph in the Plaintiff's Defence to Counterclaim.","[132, 2, 1, 134, 131, 5, 128, 130, 129, 0]"

No. 330 of 2005 Judicial Centre: Saskatoon, Family Law Division BETWEEN: EVAN GAVELIN PETITIONER - and - NEVADA PATEMAN RESPONDENT Counsel: N. Turcotte for the petitioner T. Hackl for the respondent FIAT DUFOUR J. April 30, 2008 1)
The respondent is now married and the petitioner is engaged to be married on May 31, 2008. 2)
The petitioner seeks an order that would enable him to exercise increased access to the two young children born of his relationship with the respondent. 3)
This is the second time access issues have come before the Court.
On February 1, 2007 Ryan-Froslie J. issued a fiat that specified custody and access.
It appears unlikely that they will be able to agree on much, if anything.
Granting specific access for holiday periods in the distant future acts as a disincentive for the parties to resolve matters within a reasonable time period of time. 31)
Applications to alter interim access orders are not the answer.
Moving the matter quickly to pre-trial and/or trial is. Costs 32)
Costs of this application shall be in the cause.                      J. G. D. Dufour","FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial.
The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order.
HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.
 The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule.
Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children.
The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order.","[80, 2, 79, 78, 77, 3, 4, 0, 5, 76]"

DALE HENRY, in the name and on behalf of 609897 SASKATCHEWAN LTD.,
PLAINTIFF
            Questions 4, 5 and the first branch of 6 fall to be resolved on the basis of the existing rules of court and the applicable jurisprudence, it not having been yet demonstrated that this aspect of the proceedings warrant a modification of the rules.
            The second branch of question 6 and the first branch of question 7 are self‑evident once one accepts the unity of interest between Henry and 609 which is necessarily reflected in the decision authorizing the derivative action.
It follows that relevant documents will need to be disclosed and any issue of privilege related to those documents dealt with in accordance with accepted principles.
The issue of cost of production of documents for the statement as to documents is presently to be resolved in the same manner as set out above dealing with costs generally.
            As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs.
I do wish to emphasize that, henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants who have status in these proceedings and not Henry in his personal capacity nor the board of directors of 609.","FIAT: By fiat of December 5, 2002, Gerein C.J. authorized the initiation of a derivative action by Dale Henry (Henry) on behalf of 609897 Saskatchewan Ltd. (609).
By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action.
In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought.
HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action.
The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage.
Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609.
Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action.
It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609.
Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action.
As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs.
Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609.","[55, 54, 0, 1, 53, 52, 2, 51, 3, 4, 50]"

January 30, 2009
The applicants argue that substantially similar proceedings claiming similar relief for similar claims have been commenced against the defendants and third parties in the courts of Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and previously in the Federal Court of Canada. 
ANALYSIS
[16]           All parties to this application have filed extensive Briefs of Law and Argument including Cases and Authorities in support of their respective positions.
In Englund, Richards J.A., delivering the judgment of the court, observed at para.
As I have concluded, these amendments directly and conclusively answer the question as to when the various and important considerations raised by the stay applications presented to this court should appropriately be considered - - - namely, at the certification application stage.
This court should parenthetically observe that even if the Englund case criteria were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the court, the court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss this stay application in the facts and circumstances of this case.
That alone, without the assistance of s.6 and the other amending provisions of the Sask. Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that that action should appropriately (but conditionally) be stayed.
CONCLUSION
                                                                                           T.C. ZARZECZNY ","FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act.
The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules.
The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick.
To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG).
MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent.
Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference.
Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced.
The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process.
They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money.
The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick.
The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process.
HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed.
1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.
 'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act.
The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications.
They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses.
The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad.
That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act.
That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction.
The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act.
The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed.
They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted.
2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case.
There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions.
That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed.","[26, 0, 171, 178, 25, 1, 85, 2, 170, 23, 3, 31, 87, 84, 167, 168]"

         The legislature has chosen to establish the workers’ compensation system as an self-contained system, with no right of appeal to the courts beyond the final decision of the Board:  s. 22(2).
The legislature regarded this as sufficient in matters of workers’ compensation, likely because of the extensive system that it established in the Act.
         Finally, especially in light of the comments of Sopinka, J. in Pasiechnyk, there is no reason to suppose that the Board members would not effectively deal with the issue raised by Mr. Galger.
Conclusion
         Whether or not each of the impugned decisions was made without jurisdiction and consequently is a nullity, Mr. Galger has an adequate alternative remedy available to him.
No special circumstances, that might justify judicial intervention at this time, have been presented.
An order in the nature of certiorari is not available to Mr. Galger because he has not yet pursued his right of appeal.
         The application is dismissed.

On January 2005, the Board's appeals committee upheld a 2004 decision of the Board's case management division that the applicant was fit for employment.
Although the applicant has another avenue of appeal available to him within the workers' compensation system, he takes the position that the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction, so that there is no proper decision from which to appeal, leaving him with an application for judicial review as his only remedy.

                               IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION UNDER 
62)                  In this case, it is instructive to reflect upon the USC’s reaction to the report of the Elections Board and the inconvenient truths noted therein.
The USC’s response to the report was to ignore the very process it created to ensure there was a fair referendum.
63)                  In my view, no reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice.
When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome.
64)                  Accordingly, I conclude that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice.
The applicant is entitled to a portion of the relief he seeks.
The portion I am willing to grant is limited to the effect of the referendum.
I order that the referendum held by the USSU on the issue of whether it should join the CFS is of absolutely no force or effect.
65)                  In all of the circumstances, I decline to award costs.","FIAT: In October 2005, a referendum was held within the student body of the University of Saskatchewan to determine whether the University of Saskatchewan Students Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students and its related corporation, the Canadian Federation of Students-Services.
The result favoured joining the federation.
The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995 seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum.
HELD: 1)
The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable.
In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations.
In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice?
This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues.
The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer?
2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice.
When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome.

Finally, they are told that they must not convict unless they are satisfied of the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that they must be unanimous.
It is difficult to conceive stronger antidotes than these to emotion, preconception and prejudice.
         In addition, a court can permit challenges for cause, such as those referred to in paragraph 23 of the Court of Appeal decision.
While I recognize that there has been significant pre‑trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as the ongoing memorial reports, for the reasons I have set forth, I find that the accused has not met the onus of proof necessary to succeed on this application.
Conclusion
         In conclusion, I am satisfied that a properly instructed jury will be able to deal with the issues in the trial impartially and in accordance with the evidence presented, such that the accused will receive a fair trial.
I therefore exercise my discretion and deny the application for a change of venue for the trial.
N.G. Gabrielson","FIAT: The accused applicant brings an application for a change in venue in this matter pursuant to s. 599(1) of the Criminal Code.
HELD: 1). The application for a change of venue is denied.
2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue.
There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports.
However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application.
In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue.
However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found.
Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre.
It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered.","[127, 0, 126, 128, 1, 2, 122, 125, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6, 124, 119, 120]"

Mr. McLaughlan’s reason for failure to pay his support is as set out above.
He was stubborn.
Mr. McLaughlan provides no evidence as to why he earned little income from 1995 to 1998 and in 2002, and does not, in any way, suggest that he was ill, injured or unable to work for any reasonable reason.
8)               Mr. McLaughlan appears to be suggesting that his payment of ongoing support, and any payment he must make towards arrears, leaves him in financial difficulties, given he has remarried and has two more children.
However, in order to allow Mr. McLaughlan a rescission, I would have to determine that he has, firstly, a present inability to pay arrears and, secondly, that he will not in the future be able to pay the arrears.
(Vide: Wurmlinger v. Cyca, supra; Diebel v. Diebel (1997), 1997 CanLII 11005 (SK QB), 155 Sask. R. 96 (Q.B.)).
9)               Given that Mr. McLaughlan is currently earning the sum of $45,784 per year, he can afford to pay a reasonable payment towards the outstanding arrears.
10)              For all the reasons set out above, I am dismissing Mr. McLaughlan’s application for rescission of arrears.
                                                                                                    D. L. Wilson   ","FIAT: The applicant applies for a variation of support for the parties' one child, born in February 1992.
The applicant seeks both a variation and rescission of arrears which have accumulated under the original support order.
HELD: 1) The applicant has established the necessary change in circumstance, namely the introduction of the Guidelines.
Based on the applicant's income, his child support payment is reduced from $500 per month to $425 per month.
 2) The applicant is in arrears in the amount of $56,365.60.
He has provided little explanation for his failure to pay the child support he was ordered to pay other than he was stubborn.
It is apparent that he had the ability to pay.
The application for rescission for arrears is dismissed.","[58, 0, 57, 1, 56, 2, 4, 3, 5, 53, 6, 55, 7, 54, 51, 50, 52]"

The Court is at a complete loss.
Unlike the information provided in the affidavit in Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b.
Hilltop Equipment Sales) (1998), 176 Sask. R. 293 (Q.B.), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of Ms. Scott’s affidavit is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of the indebtedness owing.
         The Plaintiff has accordingly not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.
         There shall therefore be an order:
The garnishee summons shall be set aside, and if no appeal is taken, the funds paid into court will be repaid to the garnishee, Biggar and District Credit Union, to the credit of the defendant after the expiration of the time for appeal.
The applicant shall be entitled to costs of this application which the Court fixes at $500.00, payable within 30 days of this fiat.

The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act.
HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.
 1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons.
2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand.
Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement.
3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant.
The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing.
Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing.","[64, 0, 65, 1, 62, 2, 61, 3, 4, 63, 5, 60, 59, 58, 6, 8, 7]"

No other information is provided regarding the nature of those other proceedings, whether there were other parties added, or what the pleadings involve.
The School Division advises that in seven years nothing has been resolved, prompting them to make this application.
Mr. Klein opposes the application saying he is a bona fide purchaser without notice of the Flads’ interest and relying on the indefeasibility of his title.
ANALYSIS
         In 597383 Saskatchewan Ltd. (c.o.b.
Peter's Sewer Service) (Trustee of) v. 614630 Saskatchewan Ltd. (c.o.b.
In substance, the Regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s. 87.
There will undoubtedly have to be some future consideration given to bringing all the interested parties together in consolidated or joined proceedings in the interests of effective adjudication.
The Flads were not served with notice of the present application.
I have no information about the nature and status of the proceedings taken by the Flads in connection with their caveat.
I am therefore requesting, on the matter of directing trial of an issue, that further written submissions by the parties be filed within 30 days.
                                                                                       Y. G. K. Wilkinson J.  ","FIAT: The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding an un-subdivided parcel of land.
The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act.
HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order.
Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders.
The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2)
While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings.
Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act.
The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3)
The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","[162, 163, 0, 59, 62, 60, 61, 160, 161, 63, 1, 159, 58, 2, 66]"

The Director, on the other hand, takes the position that this Court is without jurisdiction to do what the applicant seeks and, in any event, submits that the applicant has not met the criteria necessary to trigger the exercise of the Court’s discretion.
Does this Court have jurisdiction to set aside the Director’s certificate filed with the Court of Queen’s Bench?
         The Director submits that this Court is without jurisdiction to provide the relief requested by the applicant.
This is because s. 62 of the Act requires that any appeal must be launched within 21 days.
There is no provision in the Act allowing for an extension of time in which to bring an appeal and, consequently, the Court is without jurisdiction to grant the relief.
It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document or, if uncertain, at least seek assistance from someone who could help him.
         The applicant has failed to satisfy me that the third prong of the four-pronged test has been met and, accordingly, I am not prepared to exercise my discretion in favour of setting aside the Director’s certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.
COSTS
                                                                                           M.D. POPESCUL   ","FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court.
The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal.
The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria.
HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing.
Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same.
2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing.
Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable.
A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures.
Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt.
This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346.
It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered.
The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction.
This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment.
3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.
 4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake.
It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him.
The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail.
This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least.
Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default.
In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","[14, 211, 206, 0, 13, 95, 96, 1, 19, 97, 205, 204, 99]"

[4]                  As the applicant cannot bring herself within s. 30 of The Queen’s Bench Act, 1998, there is no basis for this Court to waive the limitation period.
Having arrived at this conclusion, it is not necessary to address the other arguments advanced by the applicant or the respondent.
The application to join S.A.H.O. as a party to the action is dismissed.
[5]                  The amendments sought by the applicant had S.A.H.O. been joined as a party are not allowed.
These include reference to “[e]ach of the Defendants” in paras. (a)(x)-(xiii) inclusive, and para. (a)(xv).
If the applicant wishes to substitute “the defendant” in each of the foregoing paragraphs, she may do so.
The amendments sought by the applicant
[6]                  There is obviously some duplication in some of the facts and allegations included in the “housekeeping” amendments with facts and allegations contained in the original statement of claim.
However, as there has not been any opposition to these amendments, the same are allowed.
[7]                  The respondent, S.A.H.O., is entitled to taxable costs against the applicant.
[8]                  Order accordingly.","FIAT: The applicant's motion seeks to amend the statement of claim dated December 31, 1999 in which she alleges wrongful dismissal by her employer on January 10, 1994.
The purpose of the amendment is to join the Saskatchewan Association of Health Organizations (SAHO) to the action.
The applicant seeks to make SAHO a party for the purpose of claiming from it a disability pension from the date of her termination until she turned 65 on July 29, 2000.
HELD: The application to join SAHO is dismissed.
The claims do not arise in the same time frame but are separated by a minimum of 120 days being the disability period under the disability plan.
There is no connection between the two claims.
The existing claim alleges a breach of contract of employment.
The claim proposed against SAHO alleges a breach of a contract of disability insurance.
There are no common facts.
The facts relevant to the breach of contract of employment are the applicant's performance on the job and the actions of the employer.
The facts relevant to the disability claim are the applicant's health commencing at least 120 days after her employment terminated.","[60, 0, 1, 59, 2, 58, 3, 4, 56, 57, 5, 55, 6, 54, 7, 52, 53, 8, 51, 9, 10, 11, 50]"

Aaron A. Fox, Q.C., and Barbara C. Mysko                                     for the applicants
The grounds put forward for the application may be summarized as:
I conclude the applicants have failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case.
            With respect to the criteria of irreparable harm, the harm alleged by the applicants is largely a qualitative and subjective one.
Concerns that a change in school or busing will cause stress or psychological damage to the children is speculative at this point.
There is no reason to believe that the special relationship between the residents of the Town of Wilcox and Notre Dame College which is referred to in the affidavits will be adversely affected.
There is no obvious reason why it should be.
I am not able to conclude the applicants or their children will suffer irreparable harm if a mandatory interlocutory injunction is not issued.
            The application is dismissed.
In the circumstances there will be no order as to costs.
                                                                                                                               R.D. LAING","FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school.
They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed.
HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case.
1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case.
The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity.
There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council.
There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided.
No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election.
The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding.
The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made.
To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process.
2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair.
A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter.","[269, 268, 2, 1, 271, 266, 270, 0, 267, 3, 5, 259, 6, 260, 265, 4, 7, 15, 9, 8, 10]"

March 17, 2004 
I have decided that an order should be made, but in the lesser amount of $18,000.00.
THE BACKGROUND FACTS
Subsequently, the plaintiff engaged a different sub-contractor to complete the work.
THE COURT PROCEEDINGS
[5]            Two actions have been brought in Saskatchewan.
[10]           Finally, it is noted that by order dated December 12, 1999, Pricewaterhouse Coopers Inc. was appointed as Receiver for the plaintiff.
They have since been  appointed as Trustee in Bankruptcy.
(3)            That the plaintiff has a meritorious claim.
However, on balance, I am not persuaded Rule 539(c) should be invoked.
LIABILITY OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS INC.
Having decided as I have respecting security for costs, there is no need to address this matter other than to say that no such declaration will be made.
QUANTUM OF SECURITY
[38]           The defendant asks for an order requiring security in the amount of $50,000.00.
Taking that approach, I estimate 35% of the costs should be attributed to the plaintiff’s claim.
Accordingly, I conclude that the security which should be posted is $18,000.00 for fees and disbursements.
CONCLUSION
(5)     that the application to have PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. declared  liable for any award of costs is dismissed; and
(6)     that costs of this application will be in the cause.","FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000.
HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000.
1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court.
The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.
 2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs.
Rather, it is a factor to be considered.
In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim.
It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3)
The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action.
Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate.
It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding.
4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated.
The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000.
The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant.","[0, 236, 15, 228, 229, 1, 24, 214, 16, 25, 51, 227, 59, 50, 13, 213, 210, 215, 2, 26, 211, 235]"

They are properly pled.
Summary
            The defendants are granted their application to have the plaintiffs’ claim severed so that the threshold issue of liability shall be tried prior to requiring the defendants to disclose and be discovered on the issue of damages.
            The defendants’ application to strike portions of the plaintiffs’ claim is dismissed.
            Because success has been divided, there will be no order as to costs.
            Any further applications pertaining to this litigation are to be directed to my attention in the first instance.
                                                       A.R. Rothery","FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim.
They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent.
Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages.
The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim.
HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction.
Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27.
Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit.
There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action.
The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary.
Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability.
The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated.
Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm.
This joint venture requires confidentiality.
Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence.
Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established.
It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them.
The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim.
The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course.
2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed.
The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics.
The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics.
While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act.
The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","[155, 153, 152, 5, 0, 156, 1, 4, 147, 149, 2, 154, 150, 9, 146, 8, 151, 3, 6, 143, 7]"

[12]           The applications are brought pursuant to Queen’s Bench Rule 41 which states:
41(1)      Where the joinder of multiple claims or parties in the same action may unduly complicate or delay the trial, or cause undue prejudice to a party, the court may:
(a)        order separate trials;
[21]           It will also be left to the trial judge (or the pre-trial management judge) to designate specific days on which defence evidence may be adduced during the trial and argument presented with respect to each claim.
All defendants other than those comprising the Walbaum Group shall be relieved from attending the trial on any date not designated by counsel for the plaintiffs or designated by the trial judge for adducing defence evidence and presenting argument.
[22]           Costs will be in the cause.
                                                                                                         D.P. Ball","FIAT: The defendants, Sims, Garbriel and Dumurs, bring separate motions, pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 41(a), for severance of the claims against them or for an order staying the claims against them until the plaintiffs' claim against the primary defendant, Walbaum have been heard and decided.
HELD: 1)
The Court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether to grant an application for severance.
 In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials.
Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.
 2) The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than 1 day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or Dumurs.
It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them.
Specific dates and times should be set aside for the plaintiff to call evidence with respect to its claims against each applicant group.
The applicants should be relieved from attending the trial at any other time.","[0, 1, 32, 82, 81, 118, 2, 117, 31, 83, 116, 30, 84, 33, 3, 115]"

[2]            The other two applications are brought by United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 1400 which was added as a party with the consent of the applicant.
In the one motion the Union seeks an order striking and removing virtually all the material filed in support of the application.
In the other, the Union applies for an order dismissing Wal-Mart’s motion.
[3]            I have concluded that the relief sought by the Union should be granted and that the application brought by Wal-Mart Canada Corp. should be dismissed.
BACKGROUND
[4]            To put the applications into context, it is necessary to outline the circumstances.
It is argued that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings which involve Wal-Mart.
THE MATERIALS FILED BY WAL-MART
(4)           a copy of the statement of claim in Walter Matkowski v. Government of Saskatchewan et al., filed in Saskatoon on May 10, 2006.
APPLICATION TO STRIKE THE MATERIAL 
The same applies to the extracts from Hansard and the transcript of the radio broadcast.
SUMMARY
That is not good enough.
CONCLUSION              
The Board will have no costs.","FIAT: The former vice-president of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan.
He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour.
He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour.
When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application.
Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart.
It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart.
The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart.
HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed.
The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.
 1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit.
This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility.
The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents.
2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents.
There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.
 3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart.
Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations.
Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart.
However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them.
Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath.
Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias.
To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy.
That is not good enough.","[0, 27, 1, 147, 144, 26, 2, 3, 25, 42, 28, 143, 135, 24, 23, 4, 134, 29, 83, 43, 82]"

[1]            When the judgment, dated December 14, 1999, was amended to provide that the primary residence of the child, Cassie, should be with her father, the question of the payment of maintenance by the mother was adjourned pending fulfilment of the requirement that the mother, Janice Petersen, produce all information relating to her ability to pay maintenance, and for her examination by the respondent to determine her income.
[2]            The examination has been completed, and by agreement of counsel the questions to be resolved are whether Janice Petersen has produced all relevant financial information, and whether a trial should be directed as to the amount of maintenance payable by her.
                                     FINANCIAL INFORMATION
To require them to produce their financial records, in the absence of even the slightest evidence such production would disclose anything which would in any manner assist in determining the amount of child maintenance payable by Janice Petersen, would be totally unjust.

HELD: The application was dismissed with costs in the amount of $500 to the petitioner.
Neither the petitioner's father nor the petitioner's husband was a party to the proceedings.
To require them to produce their financial records, in the absence of even the slightest evidence such production would disclose anything which would in any manner assist in determining the amount of child maintenance payable by the petitioner, would be totally unjust.","[0, 42, 37, 14, 1, 2, 12, 13, 36, 11, 15, 3]"

Kendra L. Chorney                                                                        for the petitioner
However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim.
In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support in the sum of $700.00 per month commencing effective April 1, 2006 and on the first day of each and every month hereafter until further order.
The respondent is no longer expected to contribute $80.00 per month to service family debt.
The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issues in the future.
[14]           As to costs, it is noteworthy that the parties agreed on custody, access, basic child support and entitlement to spousal support.
Each party presented meritorious arguments as to the outstanding issues dealing with extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousal support.
This display of cooperation and fairness enforces my instinct that given the opportunity and guidance required, Mr. and Mr. Frass are able to settle their issues and thereby avoid the expense and emotional damage of further litigation.
In the circumstances, I am making no award as to costs.
                                                                                           N. S. Sandomirsky","FIAT: The issues on this application are with respect to extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousal support.
HELD: 1)
The petitioner's income is $73,000 versus $29,000 for the respondent.
The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2)
The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law.
At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law.
What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents?
Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support?
2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.
 3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse.
These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI.
These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case.
However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim.
In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders.
In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700.
The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future.","[78, 79, 0, 1, 75, 2, 77, 76, 74, 4, 3, 73, 5, 6, 7, 70, 8, 72]"

[1]            The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery in this action.
[8]            The third parties deny all allegations made by the plaintiff and the defendant as third party claimant and specifically deny that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in any amount against the defendant.
Accordingly, the plaintiff applies for orders requiring them to provide full and complete responses to undertakings as discussed below.

For the reasons already provided with respect to essentially the same undertakings given by both BJ Services and Trican, there will be an order requiring Sanjel to provide a substantive response to this undertaking.
If a further examination for discovery is necessary as a result of compliance with this decision, the proper officer shall attend for examination at the expense of Sanjel at a time and location to be agreed upon or determined by the court.

Ball","FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery in this action pursuant to Rules 222, 231 and 232 of the Queen's Bench Rules and an order requiring the third parties to provide further and better disclosure of documents in their power pursuant to Rules 212 and 215.
HELD: 1) A party to litigation cannot decline to answer questions on an examination for discovery that are intended to elicit the facts on which that party has based its pleading.
A party is required to divulge the facts that it has now or admit that it has none if such is the case.
The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses.
If the position of the defendant as set forth in those responses changes as a result of after acquired information, the defendant shall so inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 90 days following the completion of the defendant's examinations for discovery of the third parties.
If it is necessary for the plaintiff to further examine for discovery on the defendant's responses or supplemental responses, the defendant's proper officer shall attend such examination for discovery.
2) The material filed satisfies the Court that PSAC documents relating to the PST issue are at least broadly relevant to the issues and that BJ Services likely has the power to obtain and produce them.
The fact that BJ Services may intend to claim a litigation privilege over the documents, or that PSAC may not produce them, does not relieve BJ Services of the obligation to disclose their existence.
BJ Services shall provide further and better disclosure of documents by providing a detailed list of documents referred to in the second part of the second schedule of its statement as to documents.
If a claim for privilege is asserted over such documents, BJ Services shall identify the basis of such claim, the date of the documents, the name of the sender and the names of the recipients.","[0, 44, 54, 343, 1, 346, 342, 338, 336, 20]"

         In my opinion this application turns on the interpretation of the impact of the Court of Appeal decision in the CIBC v. Sylvester case, supra.
I do not see that in rejecting the proffered defences in the Sylvester case the Court of Appeal has necessarily circumscribed the pleadable defences in the manner that FCC contends.
I am unable to accept the submission that these cases serve to preclude the defences advanced by National in the present cases, arising, as they do, specifically from the express provisions of an alleged inter-creditor agreement.
I accept that such pleading can serve to delay, but not defeat, FCC, or prevent FCC from proceeding with its foreclosure actions.
         The defences advanced by National are, as was the situation in the 663073 Alberta Ltd. case, supra, so closely connected with FCC’s demands that it would be manifestly unjust for FCC to proceed without taking National’s defences into consideration.
CONCLUSION
         Both applications are accordingly dismissed.
Although the facts and circumstances in each case are virtually identical, the complexity of them makes it appropriate that each defendant recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff.
                                                                                                      J.D.

HELD: The applications were dismissed with each defendant to recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff.

[5]                                      The applications shall be dealt with in the order raised herein, starting with the application by the plaintiffs relating to the defendant, Dr. Graham.
Should the plaintiffs be required to respond to undertakings number 37, 42, 43, 46 and 52 given during the examination for discovery of Mark Baert?
                            The obligation of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery is contained in Rule 231 of The Queen’s Bench Rules:
He shall be liable if a plaintiff to have his action dismissed, and if a defendant to have his defence, if any, struck out and to be placed in the same position as if he had not defended.
                            Undertaking number 37 is to advise of any facts on which the plaintiffs may rely in the future to establish a claim of incompetency against Dr. Graham (taken under advisement).
A number of applications have been adjourned.
Those applications may be brought back; if so, the matter of costs can then be spoken to.
If no further matters are brought back to the court, costs may be spoken to at the request of any party.","FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery.
The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery.
HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue.
If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value.
At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons.
Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals.
Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged.
Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories.
Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings.
The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency.
The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories.
If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor.
Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.
 2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action.
Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency.
Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence.
The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages.
The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages.
It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages.
The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved.
Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor.
It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor.
In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded.
If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3)
The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules.
To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered.
If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided.
4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff.
However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.","[3, 242, 0, 241, 207, 208, 205, 204, 70, 240]"

[14]           Finally, the mother requests interim spousal support.
Although it is clear from the evidence that the mother has an entitlement to interim spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay.
I am directed by s. 15.3(1) of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.) to give priority to child support in determining child and spousal support applications.
In the matter before me, I find I am unable to make a spousal support order because the father does not have necessary resources to pay a monthly sum to the mother once he has satisfied his child support obligations.
My determination of this matter, at this interim stage, should not affect the right of the mother to pursue spousal support in the future.
Although the father has been voluntarily providing child support to the mother, at least since February, 2007, the mother was required to bring this motion to obtain an appropriate sharing of s. 7 expenses.
The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400.00 forthwith.

The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer.
It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program.
On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody.
The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments.
If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month.
The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month.
Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.
 2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3)
The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400.","[59, 60, 1, 0, 58, 57, 2, 3, 56, 4, 54, 5, 53, 6, 55]"

While he acknowledges an obligation to pay child support, there is an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive.
A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 1, 2006 is warranted.
As of January 1, 2007, child support should be increased to reflect his 2006 income, being $112,064.
This order will result in child support arrears of $8,107, calculated as follows:
Income
Period
Table Support
Amount Due
Amount Paid
Arrears
Jan. 1, 2006 to Apr. 30, 2007
1997 Tables - $1,055 x 4 mos.
May 1, 2006 to Dec. 32, 2006
2006 Tables - $1,202 x 8 mos.
2006 Tables - $1,531 x 1 mo.
28)                  Mr. Gavelin shall pay the child support arrears of $8,107 at the rate of $500 per month commencing February 15, 2007 and payable on the 15th day of each and every month thereafter until the arrears are paid in full.
29)                  As the results of the within application are mixed, costs of this application shall be costs in the cause.","FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005.
The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access.
The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive.
The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child.
That is the situation here.
There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis.
In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible.
The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation.
That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday.
This seems reasonable on an interim basis.
This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring.
It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased.
The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months.
He will have to be re-introduced to them.
A phase in period is required. 2)
The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years.
His gross income in 2006 was $112,064.
This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer.
The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes.
This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary.
The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3)
The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application.
The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006.
The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005.
He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006.
He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children.
The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.
 The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's.
The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs.
The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship.
There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application.
A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","[181, 2, 1, 0, 177, 5, 4, 6, 175, 179, 3, 178, 173, 174, 8, 7, 176, 172, 9, 10, 171, 11, 180, 169, 12, 168, 170, 167, 164, 15]"

Mr. Therrien submits that it would be a conflict of interest for Mr. Sauer to continue to represent Ms. Therrien, as the issues between the parties have not been settled.
Mr. Therrien further relies on the provisions of the collaborative law agreement signed by the parties.
                                                 THE FACTS
[3]            There is a dispute on the facts concerning what was discussed at the initial meeting of the parties with their lawyers.
The Lawyers’ Views
Reginald Sauer
[7]            Mr. Sauer deposes to the following in his affidavit of March 1, 2006 filed in response to the application by Michael Therrien:
It is possible that two different contracts were discussed but I have no recollection of whether it was or not.
My file includes no notes or other correspondence, including any letters to my client, in regard to lawyers either withdrawing, or not being required to withdraw as a result of the Collaborative Law process.
I do not have any recollection of whether this was discussed with either of the parties or Reginald Sauer.
                                                DISCUSSION
[10]           The conflict in the facts was apparent at the time of the initial application.
                                                                                                      E. J. Gunn","FIAT: The respondent brings an application for a court order requiring Reginald Sauer to withdraw as solicitor for the petitioner.
The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged by the respondent that confidential information was shared.
The respondent also relies on the provisions of the collaborative law agreement signed by the parties.
HELD: 1) The conflict in the facts was apparent and was not resolved by additional evidence.
2) Mr. Sauer agreed to withdraw as counsel so the parties may proceed to pre-trial and a trial without the necessity of a viva voce hearing.","[0, 15, 142, 150, 1, 141, 97, 140, 143, 139, 98, 99, 16, 17, 14, 2]"

It appears that the mother is also assisting David and that David may, in fact, not be a child under the law when he turns 18 years of age in March, 2010. 
[22]           I have not prepared the calculation of arrears, of both s. 3 and s. 7 support, now due and owing by the father for the time period from May, 2009 to the end of December, 2009.
I trust the parties will, given my determination of income, be able to calculate what arrears are owing, if any.
If the parties cannot do so, leave is granted to return the matter to me for further consideration.
[23]           With respect to the issue of costs, the mother shall have her costs of this motion which I set in the sum of $600.00 payable forthwith.
[24]           As a final comment, I would encourage the parties to make every reasonable effort to negotiate and determine the appropriate recalculation of support each May, in accordance with their agreement and consent order.
Alternatively, if the parties find themselves unable to perform that recalculation from year to year, the parties should consider amending their support agreement so as to avoid these costly court proceedings.
                                                                                                 D. L. WILSON","FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008.
She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father.
The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order.
It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1)
The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated.
The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008.
The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return.
She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year.
The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income.
It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months.
It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have.
The severance is included as part of the father's income.
2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income.
The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division.
The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains.
See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177.
3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.
 4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income.
However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment.
As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5)
The mother shall have her costs of $600.","[1, 138, 0, 141, 140, 2, 137, 136, 139, 4, 3, 135, 5, 134]"

11)                  Ms. Aaston has indicated that she shall have a good idea of Brina’s post-secondary costs with regard to the 2006/2007 university year by September, 2006.
There shall be an order that she provide a list of those expenses, with any documentation she has to support the same, to Mr. Alm by September 15, 2006 and that she also provide evidence of any student loans or other contributions by third parties to these expenses.
The s. 7 expenses should be adjusted effective October 1, 2006 for the 2006/2007 university year.
12)                  As the results of the application are mixed, there shall be no order as to costs.","FIAT: The sole issue before the court is the amount to be fixed for the ongoing s. 7 expenses.
The s. 7 expenses claimed by the petitioner include dental work of $112.90 for Kristen, orthodontic work for Brina and costs associated with Brina's post-secondary education.
It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities that necessitate certain tools such as a computer for her to be successful in her post-secondary training.
HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses and there shall be an order accordingly.
2) The September 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina's s. 7 expenses.
Accordingly the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s. 7 costs.
2) The crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on Brina's part and will assist her with her future plans.
3) The Zeller's supplies would normally be covered under the Table support and that expense is disallowed.
4) Brina's s. 7 post-secondary expenses are $7,123.72 and include tuition, crisis prevention class and books, required university books, bus pass, black cartridge for the printer, Shaw internet, Microsoft licence, computer repairs and updated virus protection.","[76, 1, 0, 75, 3, 2, 73, 4, 5, 71, 6, 74, 70, 7, 69, 8, 68, 9, 72]"

Therefore ownership transferred to the respondent free and clear of the claims of the applicant, October 19, 2009. 
When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096’s election on October 19, 2009. 
The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof.
Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent 101138096 free and clear of the claim of the applicant.
Therefore the applicant’s application is dismissed with costs to the respondent, 101138096 Saskatchewan Ltd.
It is further ordered that the registration under the Act made by Inland as registration number 300516894 be discharged.
                                                                               M.D. ACTON   ","FIAT: This is an application for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act requiring the respondents or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of construction equipment.
The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008.
Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009.
In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head.
In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration.
Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment.
In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number.
The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment.
Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096.
September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head.
The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken.
On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness.
As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment.
Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008.
The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009.
This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland.
HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents.
The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession.
As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act.
When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009.
The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof.
Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent 101138096 free and clear of the claim of the applicant.","[87, 86, 1, 2, 0, 85, 83, 84, 3, 4, 81, 5, 6, 82, 80, 79, 7, 8, 9, 76]"

I decline to grant the order.
THE APPLICATION
[2]            The application is brought pursuant to Queen’s Bench Rule 173 which provides:
The Court may at any stage of an action order any pleading or any part thereof to be struck out, with or without leave to amend, on the ground that: 
[3]            The affidavits of several individuals, including the defendant, have been filed in support of the application.
In each of them certain conduct of the defendant is described in some detail.
However, they make no reference to the alleged defamatory remarks.
ANALYSIS         
[12]           In the instant case, there is no evidence before me about the circumstances surrounding the several remarks.
I do not even know that the defendant made the remarks, let alone any reason for doing so.
Accordingly, it cannot be said that she fits within a situation like that in the Mitchell case.
It follows that this submission must be rejected.

She has made choices which have resulted in greater expense to insure that Kaira sees both parents.
Accordingly, the cost of transporting Kaira to and from Victoria shall be borne by Lesly.
However it is fair that Mike contribute something to this cost.
Mike shall pay to Lesly, for each occasion that Kaira travels to Victoria for parenting time with Lesly, the sum of $150.00 but only for the trip from Regina to Victoria.
Lesly shall advise Mike if Kaira will on each occasion be transported to Victoria for parenting time with her.
For the purpose of Lesly’s parenting time, one or both of Lesly’s parents may transport Kaira.
[12]           During the time that Kaira is being parented by each parent, the other parent shall have telephone access to Kaira every second day at 7:00 p.m. Regina time during Mike’s parenting time and 7:00 p.m.
Victoria time during Lesly’s parenting time as the case may be and each parent shall provide to the other telephone numbers where Kaira may be reached and shall make Kaira available for such telephone access.

There is conflicting information about the nature and extent of the petitioner father's parenting duties.
The respondent has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school.
She applies as the primary parent to have the child go with her.
The petitioner would like Kaira to remain in Saskatchewan and have regular contact with each parent on alternating weeks.

The Court cannot determine on conflicting affidavits what the primary parent status quo is.
2) It is in the best interest that the child see both parents.
There was a similar course in Saskatoon that the respondent could have taken which would have made more frequent changes possible, but her affidavit indicates she thinks the Saskatoon course is inferior to the one she is taking in Victoria.

This application under Section 2 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act requires consideration of the following points in relation to the provisions of Act; 
1)         The purpose of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act as set out in Section 4 of the Act.
2)         The motion materials filed by the applicant are deficient and ought to a least include;
a)         a copy of the notices of intention with proper proofs of service.
This result would be unwarranted given that the scheme of the legislation is to encourage discussions between debtors and creditors and the only material before me indicates that the respondent has refused to participate in the discussions on the mortgage issues.
Accordingly, the application is adjourned to August 21, 2000 at 1:30 p.m. and leave is given to each of the applicant and respondent to file further materials.
The Farm Land Security Board is requested to provide its report to the court following the procedures set out in Section 12 of the Act, by that same date..
6)           No costs to any party.
The registrar is instructed to send a copy of this fiat to the Farm Land Security Board.","This application under s.2 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act (SFSA) requires the Court to consider a number of points in relation to the act.

Several necessary documents must be filed.
In addition, the Farm Land Security Board has not completed its mandatory tasks under the Act.
HELD: Application adjourned and leave is given to each party to file further materials.
The Farm Land Security Board is requested to provide its report to the Court.
Ordinarily, the deficiency in the applicant's motion might merit dismissal, but the Act would then give the respondent a 1 year grace period.
This result is unwarranted given that the scheme of the legislation is to encourage discussions between debtor and creditor and the respondent has refused to discuss mortgage issues.
Further, the respondent's refusal to provide information should not be allowed to derail the process of financial review by the Farm Land Security Board.

            Counsel for the applicant raised the issue of costs as a reason why the litigation should be stayed pending a determination of the plaintiff’s mental competence.
I am not aware of any law that suggests costs incurred in defending oneself in a civil action against a person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are not recoverable from the estate of such person.
            With respect to the applicant’s request in the alternative that the Court order an examination pursuant to s. 50 of The Queen’s Bench Act, the section provides:
In any action brought to recover damages or other compensation for or in respect of bodily injuries sustained by any person, the court may order that the person, in respect of whose injury the damages or compensation is sought, shall submit to be examined by one or more duly qualified medical practitioners, whom neither party proposes to call as a witness or witnesses at the trial of the action.
The applicant admits the purpose of the requested examination is not for the purpose of assessment of damages at this point in time, but for another purpose as outlined in the foregoing.
This legislation does not apply to this application.
            The application is dismissed.
            The plaintiff is entitled to his costs of the application in any event of the cause.
            Order accordingly.","FIAT. A defendant applied for an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court, alternatively s.50 of the Queen's Bench Act, for an order requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days; requiring a report to be filed with the court as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct his solicitor; and staying proceedings until a report is filed.
The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate.
The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
 1)Our civil procedure does not contemplate the trial of an issue on a person's competence to bring a lawsuit.
A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act had the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding legal proceedings and would result in the appointment of a litigation guardian.
This step was not deemed necessary based on the evidence presented.
A stay was refused.
 2)Costs incurred in defending a civil action against a person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are recoverable from the estate.
3)Queen's Bench Act s.50 did not apply.
 4)The plaintiff was entitled to his costs in any event of the cause.","[88, 89, 0, 87, 86, 1, 85, 2, 4, 83, 3, 82, 6, 5, 80, 8, 84]"

The subtleties involved in making the distinction, factually and legally, as to whether the plaintiff’s remarks constituted an operative misrepresentation cannot, in my view, be resolved in the absence of cross-examination.
In that case, Laing J. said at para.
...the test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavit material filed, but rather, whether despite the contradictory evidence, the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would not otherwise be unjust to do so.
One way that contradictory evidence can be decided in the absence of cross-examination is where for the purposes of the application the court accepts the defendant’s evidence wherever it conflicts with that of the plaintiff and still concludes the plaintiff is entitled to judgment....
            If I accept the defendant’s evidence, then I must assume the plaintiff represented, as a statement of fact, that he was being sued by SGI for damages in the range of $250,000 to $300,000, even if the remaining remarks (that he would be found liable, and that he would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy rendering the defendant’s account uncollectible) were merely prognostic, or mere statement of opinion.
            The plaintiff’s application for summary judgment is dismissed.
A summary trial is hereby ordered.
            Costs will remain in the cause.","Creditor and Debtor - Conversion - Punitive Damages
FIAT. A motion for summary judgment under Queen's Bench Rule 485 governing simplified procedure.
The plaintiff claimed the creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account for a lesser sum ($2,000 on a $15,600 account).
He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'.
The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001.
In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle.
An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died.
The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible.
SGI initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in May 2002 claiming $17,660.
The defendant contended that, if there was an accord and satisfaction, it was avoided due to mistake of fact or misrepresentation.
HELD: The application for summary judgment was dismissed.
A summary trial was ordered.
Costs in the cause.

Sandra Klarenbach, it is expected, will remain in possession of the property until ordered to vacate.
[9]                                      Without some assurance that a realtor, judicially appointed and authorized to effect sale of the property, will have reasonable access to the property, the order sought by the applicant is not expedient.
In my view, a judicial sale, in the circumstances of this case, is not a realistic option at this time.
Border Credit Union cannot be expected to endure further delay and deterioration of its security position without an undertaking by both registered owners that they will facilitate a judicial sale.
The material before me does not provide such assurance.
On the contrary, there is no evidence that Sandra Klarenbach will co-operate in having the property shown to prospective buyers.
                            The registered owners have had ample opportunity since their separation to resolve their family property dispute.
The foreclosure proceedings have been in progress for six months.
This is not the proper forum to attempt to effect a family property settlement.
The application is dismissed.","FIAT. After a decree nisi of foreclosure had issued but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners (the former husband) applied for judicial sale of the matrimonial home.
The joint owners separated in 1999 and are involved in an acrimonious family law court action.
The wife has exclusive possession of the property.
The Credit Union as first mortgagee opposed the application.
The co-owner did not participate.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
1)This is not the proper forum to attempt to affect a family property settlement.
The husband was not entitled in these proceedings to a possession order.
The wife prevented every attempt to show the property to prospective owners.
There was no reason to assume she will be any more cooperative with a court appointed realtor.
The Credit Union did not request immediate possession.
2)The court's entitlement to order a judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable.
The court reviewed the history of the statutory authority for a judicial sale in a mortgage foreclosure proceedings.
The 1852 Chancery Procedure Amendment Act was repealed in 1881 and replaced by Ordinance 51, Rule 1, which became law in the NWT by virtue of the Judicature Ordinance No.6 of 1893.
It is now found in s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act in its modified form.

There was no attempt by the landlord to amend this claim at the hearing of this matter before the Rentalsman.
Mr. Maley could, if he had chosen to do so, have sought out a skilled house cleaner prior to the hearing by the Rentalsman and had that person attend with him to  consider the evidence that was going to be presented by the landlord (including the pictures that Mr. Maley was aware would be shown).
It is, therefore, my view that Mr. Maley was not denied natural justice and due process in this matter.
[7]                 Finally, I cannot find that the Rentalsman’s decision is patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the facts.
The Rentalsman made the decision in this matter after having reviewed the pictures filed by the landlord, the repair bills filed by the landlord, and the statements of the house cleaners who indicated the hours worked and the hourly rate utilized.
The Rentalsman reached a decision based on all the evidence and came to a conclusion that was not patently unreasonable given that evidence.
[8]                 The appeal of Mr. Maley herein is dismissed.","FIAT. After the tenant vacated the home, the landlord, pursuant to Residential Tenancies Act s.47, sought $3,746.76 for rent loss, cleaning, damage to the premises and unpaid utilities.
The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01.
The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence.
The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process.
While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting.
The Rentalsman's decision, made after reviewing pictures, repair bills and the statements of house cleaners, who indicated the hours worked and their hourly rate, was not patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the evidence.","[49, 0, 48, 1, 2, 3, 46, 47, 45, 4, 5, 42, 6, 44]"

L.J. Chomyn                                                                          for the respondent, the Public Trustee
Mrs. Sotnikow’s will divides her estate equally amongst her six children, and the four children who are not applicants consent to the application without a necessity of a bond.
            On the foregoing facts, I am not able to conclude this is an appropriate case to dispense with a bond.
This conclusion is not a reflection on the integrity of the applicants which I have no reason to doubt.
The fact is this is a routine application by siblings, who are most usually the applicants, and to consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s. 55(1).
Almost every application would so qualify, because in most cases the nearest relatives always consent.
            The application to be appointed personal decision-makers is in order, and an order may issue with the authorities identified in the draft order submitted.
            With respect to the application for property guardianship no order is made.
Leave is granted to the applicants to supplement the existing material should they see fit to do so.","FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's.
Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond.
This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001.
Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc.
The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000.
Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate.
HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted.
No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship.
The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4).
Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment.
The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate.

The undertaking given by the respondent on March 5, 1993 is absolutely clear.
                  If more were needed, one need only note that these statements of account were all directed to the respondent without objection.
His inquiry of March 12, 1997 makes it clear also that Power recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the matter of the applicant’s account.
                  The only conclusion that can be drawn from the facts is that the respondent guaranteed the payment of the applicant’s account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client’s actions.
I have sympathy for the respondent but he is presumed to know the canons of the Law Society.
In one sense, an undertaking given to a layperson is to be viewed in an even more critical light as that person does not have the training and experience to understand the nuances of legal language.
                  The applicant is entitled to succeed.
DISPOSITION
                  The applicant will have payment for the amount of its claim, interest as provided for in the undertaking and costs of the action.","FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty.
In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees.
The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum.
The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC.
When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies.
The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33.
The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit.
HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.
 1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure.
2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.
 3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence.
It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits.
4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions.
A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings.
The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear.
The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt.
His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","[0, 148, 1, 147, 146, 4, 143, 2, 3, 5, 142, 140, 7, 8, 141, 138, 6, 145]"

They deal solely with the interpretation  of The  Education  Act and the extent to  which  the  school board  remains liable, even though the teacher  might  be immune from liability.
I  find  the  reasoning in Neault to be directly  on point.
Just  as The Workers' Compensation Act  and  The Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the  owner  of  the vehicle because he is prevented  from suing  the  driver, The Education Act  extends  the  same immunity  to  the  owner  as it does  to  the  driver  by operation  of  the same s. 86(1) of The  Highway  Traffic Act.      For  the  reasons  stated,  I  find  Edith  Larsen's immunity under The Education Act extends to the owner  of the  motor vehicle, Harold Larsen.
Because Edith  Larsen is  not  liable to the plaintiff pupil, neither is Harold Larsen.","FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act.
The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability.
The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher.
HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act.
2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver.
The reasoning in Neault was directly on point.
Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act.
3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes.
When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act.
The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers.
The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute.
4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer.
The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.","[44, 2, 1, 42, 41, 43]"

HELD: The solicitor and the law firm were disqualified from acting for the petitioner in the action.
Because two years had lapsed further examinations were appropriate and an order issued for the petitioner to attend a further examination.

At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d).
The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields.
He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October.
He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work.
The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated.
HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month.
1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income.
The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997.
Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past.
No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years.
The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded.
In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable.
The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck.
The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children.
His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine.

The father`s proportional share of this cost is $28 per month.

On May 12, 1998 I delivered a judgment under which exclusive  possession and ownership of the matrimonial  home was granted to the petitioner, Stella Hlynski (""Stella"").
At trial,  both Stella and her husband Michael Hlynski (""Mike"") had  been seeking an order for exclusive possession  of  the matrimonial  home.
At  the time of  the  trial,  they  were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither of them would vacate the home.

In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent.
At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules.
The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus.
The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal.
Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15.
HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court.
No case law could be found in support of either party.
It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.","[23, 0, 22, 1, 2, 21, 20, 3]"
123,"I reserved decision on the questions of child and spousal maintenance, including costs of access and counselling.          I believe it is common ground that the respondent's 1996 income included the following:   Employment                     $ 22,950.00   Unemployment insurance benefits   5,197.00   Town councillor's indemnity         700.00                     Total         $28,847.00          It is argued on behalf of the petitioner, Joy Anne Bartch, that in addition to that income, the respondent has, as shareholder and officer of Bartch Building Movers Ltd., access to additional funds.

This information should be supplied by plaintiffs’ counsel within 45 days.
            With respect to questions the plaintiffs’ representatives did not answer on discovery with respect to facts, knowledge, and position the same must be answered for the reasons outlined in the foregoing.
            With respect to the names of potential witnesses, defence counsel are entitled to a reciprocal order to that made in favour of the plaintiffs.
The names of persons who have provided facts or observations prior to the accident to counsel for the plaintiffs’ relevant to the issues are to be disclosed in the same circumstances outlined with respect to the order in favour of the plaintiffs.
            To the extent applicable, the remarks made in the foregoing and the orders made in the foregoing with respect to disclosure and names of witnesses apply equally to Kilborn.
Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion.
Apart from the issue of whether such character evidence would be admissible at trial, the question as framed is improper.
            As success has been mixed in this matter, there will be no order as to costs.
            Orders accordingly.","FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery.
Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege.
The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor.
HELD: 1)Relevancy.
The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence.
Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant.
Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous.
Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not.
Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial.
Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable.
Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced.
Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked.
The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant.
Leave was granted to reapply for direction.
2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed.
The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged.
(b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted.
The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed.
The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda.
(c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable.
The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident.
While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable.
A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants.
(d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial.
Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference.
(e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged.
It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident.
(f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement.
The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer.
Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview.
(g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation.
3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees.
The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed.
Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues.
4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days.
5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed.
The question was relevant only to character.
Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion.
6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","[274, 277, 0, 276, 271, 1, 4, 269, 266, 273, 7, 268, 2, 265]"

ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CANADA
 [7]                   I have read the minutes of the pre-trial management proceedings conducted by my colleague Maurice J. of this Court and am satisfied that this action and the other actions pending resolution of this action will be fairly dealt with under the Rules.
In my opinion, and I want to be emphatic about this, the fears of procedural unfairness expressed by counsel for the Attorney General if the issues are severed are groundless.
 [8]                   Moreover, I am in total agreement with my colleague Noble J. of this Court who in his judgment dealing with other issues of this action took the time to express his concerns over the delay the plaintiff had up to that time been subjected to by the paper war conducted by the parties to the cross-claim and third party proceedings (see Noble J.'s judgment dated November 23, 2000).
 [9]                   I am satisfied that it is in the best interests of justice that the order of severance sought by the plaintiff should be granted so that the issue raised in the action may proceed to an early trial.
 [10]                  I therefore order that the plaintiff's claim shall proceed to trial separate from, and before, the trial of the issues raised in the cross-claim and the third party claim in this action.","FIAT. The applicant applied for an order severing the issues from those raised by the cross-claim and third party proceedings so that his claim may proceed to trial.
The Attorney General opposed severance on the ground the Government of Canada would be prejudiced in its claim for apportionment of the amount of any judgment as between the Government of Canada and the Oblates.
HELD: It was in the best interests of justice that the order of severance be granted so the issue may proceed to an early trial.
The issues of cross-claim and third party proceedings will take a very lengthy period of time.
Hundreds of other claimants who have been asked by the management pre-trial judge to regard the plaintiff's action as a test case were awaiting a judgment.","[0, 33, 1, 32, 2, 3, 30, 4, 5, 29, 31]"

The applicant seeks an order staying the hearing scheduled by the respondent Commission for November 19, 1998 to review a decision of the respondent Authority to suspend the applicant`s ""tavern permit"" for a period of three days, until criminal charges arising out of the same facts are disposed of. [2]
The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing, even if it should become known to the Crown, is not going to result in any new facts that are not already known to it.
Because the Commission is not relying on a conviction, it will have the onus of adducing evidence related to the alleged breaches of s. 112(1) of The Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act, and presumably the defence will consist of denying one or more of the elements implicit in the allegations.
The applicant has failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence if the Commission hearing is allowed to take place as scheduled.
The application is dismissed with costs.                        _____________________________________J.","FIAT. The applicant hotel was charged with five breaches of s.112(1)of the Alcohol and Gaming Act for failing to demand proof of age from minors.
The hotel was convicted on one charge and the remaining charges were held in abeyance pending its appeal.
The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges.
Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.
1)The second ground raised a substantive issue and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth.
There was nothing inconsistent with the Commission considering a form of disqualification of the applicant's license or permit, while the state exercises its criminal law power with respect to the same set of facts.
2)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence.
The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing will not result in any new facts that were not already known to the Crown.","[32, 31, 1, 0, 30, 29]"

The respondents also did not comment on what if any offers of purchase they have received in the past year and a half.
 [14]                  I am not comfortable at setting an upset price for the sale at $61,000.00 considering the amount of money the respondents have invested in the property, unless there is no other choice.
At the same time, I am not comfortable guessing at what if any higher upset price should be set.
 [15]                  In the end result, I consider it reasonable to adjourn this application to myself on June 7, 2001 at a time to be set by the local registrar.
If this time does not allow the respondents to resolve the debt, by sale of the property or refinancing, then the respondents shall have the onus on the return date of providing evidence why the upset price suggested by the applicant should not be included in an order nisi for sale.
The evidence submitted by the respondents to date does not do this.

The amount owing on the mortgage was $61,194.91 as of February 12.
In issue was whether the home was a homestead within the meaning of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act when s.44(17) was proclaimed on September 20, 1992.
HELD: The application was adjourned to June 7.
1)The homestead provisions of s.44 had no application in this case.
The land was not being put to any farming use prior to August 1992 and the respondent's house at the time fell into the category of 'simply a dwelling in isolation' (Bank of Nova Scotia v. Blair).
2)There was no recent appraisal information available.

128,"The respondent Heritage Freehold Specialists Ltd. is seeking to lapse the caveats and has served notices to lapse on Home Oil in respect to all of the caveats.
Each of the caveats is based on an agreement taken by Freeholders Oil Company Limited from the registered owner of the minerals.          Heritage fairly concedes that it is not seeking a summary dismissal of the application to continue the caveats.

The respondent sought an order directing the caveats be continued on the condition Home Oil commence an action within a reasonable time to determine their validity.
At issue was whether the caveator or the challenger should be required to initiate an action.
HELD: The caveats were to be continued until a further court order was filed in the Land Titles Office or until they were withdrawn.
1) Each of the agreements was prima facie still in existence as there had been no cancellation or rescission of the agreements and Home Oil was the valid successor of the interest of Freeholders.
2) Further documentation would be required by a trial judge to determine the issue of the validity of Home Oil's interest in the leases including whether Home Oil's lease violated the rule against perpetuities.

She did, however, oppose the requested order.
                                                             DISCUSSION
            I am satisfied that all of the relevant facts which are available are now before me.
Based on those facts, I am also satisfied that Rodh and Sarauer intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly.
On the facts of this case there has been an obvious mistake which requires rectification.
The confidence of the public in the administration of justice and the Land Titles system would be in danger of being undermined if such obvious mistakes were not cured by the courts.
            There will be an order that the Registrar of the Battleford Land Titles Office amend existing Certificate of Title #97B13424 containing a portion of SE¼ 27-47-26-W3M by inserting after the names of the registered owners, John Roman Sarauer and Maureen Janette Rodh the words, “as joint tenants”.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.87 and s.251 of the Land Titles Act cancelling the existing certificate of Title in the names of the deceased and herself as tenants in common and directing the Land Titles Registrar to issue a new title in their joint names with right of survivorship.
The deceased and applicant who had been living together purchased residential property in 1997.
Their lawyer prepared a written agreement for the sellers and purchasers as well as the mortgage describing the purchasers as joint tenants.
The sellers, unrepresented by legal counsel, prepared the transfer of the property and title issued without the words 'joint tenants'.
The error describing the purchasers went unnoticed by their lawyer.
The respondent had been married to the deceased when he died intestate in 1998.
As the title stood an undivided one-half interest was owned by the estate and would devolve to the respondent pursuant to the Intestate Succession Act.
HELD: The Land Titles Office Registrar was to amend the existing certificate of title by inserting 'joint tenants' after the names of the registered owners.
1)The requirements set out in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Rochon were satisfied.
There was an obvious mistake which required rectification.
The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly.
The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did.
2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.","[0, 44, 10, 45, 57, 1, 11, 58, 56, 25, 46]"

On the following grounds:   (a) that the agreement between the parties       on the facts constitutes a security       agreement and is not a true lease;   (b) that because the agreement is a       security agreement and not a true lease,       pursuant to s. 18 of The Limitation of       Civil Rights Act, the Respondent vendor is       limited to a lien upon the articles sold       only, notwithstanding any contrary       agreement between the parties.          The parties entered into an agreement in early 1997 in which the respondent as lessor agreed to lease a tractor- trailer unit to the applicant for the payments specified therein.
The proper forum to have the issues raised in this matter determined, is the action commenced by the respondent.          The application is dismissed.

The respondent seized the vehicle and issued a statement of claim for $5,330.81 as arrears of lease payments.
The applicant had made payments for several months and acknowledged that she was in default on the payments for the tractor-trailer unit but contended the agreement was not a lease and that the respondent, having repossessed the collateral, was not now entitled to claim any additional payments.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
Costs in the cause.
1)The relief sought did not fall within any of the wording of s63(2) of the Personal Property Security Act and therefore there was no jurisdiction to grant the relief requested.

[2]                  A number of grounds were advanced by defence counsel which will be dealt with more specifically hereinafter.
A review of the case indicates the seriousness of the breach was the overwhelming consideration for excluding the evidence.
In other words the two events did not amount to a course of conduct.
This coincidence does not trigger a concern for the propriety of ongoing police investigations.
I conclude it is more likely than not that exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of his premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
            The evidence obtained as a result of the search of Mr. Derksen’s residence on April 2, 1997 is admissible at trial.
With respect to the lack of monitoring allegation, the intercepted conversations have already been excluded from evidence and there is no need to deal with this issue.
With respect to the improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused, this is a collateral matter and does not affect the fairness of the trial.
The application for a stay of proceedings is dismissed.
            Order accordingly.","FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.
 They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter.
The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization.
As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with.
The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry.
The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information.
HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed.
The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial.
The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside.
The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure.
The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.
 2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence.
It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates.
4)The 1997 authorization was set aside.
The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter.
The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met.
There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed.
The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading.
The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch.
The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved.
Neither had a criminal record.
The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.
 5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization.
A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization.
The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant.
The privacy interest was comparatively high.
The nature of the constitutional breach was major.
The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis.
6)The residence search warrant was set aside.
The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge.
The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information.
The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable.
7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale.
There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met.
While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith.
On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.
 8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant.
The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter.
A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants.
The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras.
The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast.
The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along.
It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid.
The two events did not amount to a course of conduct.
9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","[423, 424, 426, 0, 425, 1, 421, 417, 418, 4, 420, 412, 2, 6, 3, 5, 9, 7, 21]"

July 2, 1996          Clearly, the defendant, Kasper Gordon Bawolin (""Bawolin""), has been in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff, Viola Rose Siemens (""Siemens""), for her trust funds.
His contempt however, is not as blatant as appeared initially.
When all the evidence is in, it may transpire that Siemens was in fact, indebted to Bawolin as he now says, at the time of the contempt.
Such a turn of events would not excuse his disobedience of the court orders, but it might influence the trial judge on the matter of costs.
Moreover, the judge might conclude, once the whole story is revealed, that the legal costs incurred to enforce production are out of proportion to any gain which Siemens could reasonably have expected to achieve.          Costs are left to the trial judge.                                                              J.","FIAT. The defendant had been held in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for her trust funds.
The issue here was responsibility for the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to compel production.
Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized.
An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention.
Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.
 1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared.
Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties.
2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics.
However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge.
It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs.
It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","[17, 16, 1, 0, 15]"

                                        IN THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH
The defendant seeks to have the costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim.
FACTS
The judgment obtained by the plaintiff was for $77,406.15 together with some additional special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total judgment of $120,540.43.
SECOND COUNSEL FEE 
A second counsel fee is allowed at 50 percent of the first counsel fee.
GENERAL
                              The plaintiff also claims costs for four pre-trial conferences, an unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, a pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses, and transcripts of the medical evidence obtained prior to final argument.
Those are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court.
Both counsel suggested that they are not adverse to having the Court provide some guidance.
In this case the transcripts proved to be of considerable value to the Court in reconciling and comparing the evidence of medical experts of similar qualifications relating to a specialized field.
It is recommended that the plaintiff’s expenses in having the transcripts provided to the Court be recovered from the defendant.
                              Costs payable by the plaintiff to the defendant on interlocutory applications may be deducted from the plaintiff’s Bill of Costs.","FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store.
The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43.
The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused.
The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to.
The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports.
At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed.
HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success.
Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs.
Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party.
2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages.
3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value.
Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case.
Expenses of each was examined separately.
In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant.
4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee.
A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel.
The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case.
Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court.
It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant.
Costs payable by the plaintiff on an interlocutory application may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs.","[0, 182, 13, 158, 181, 1, 149, 160, 157, 180, 159, 20, 14, 161]"

For this mother, whose anxiety has engendered a great deal of problems, the enforced separation from the child is likely the ultimate sanction that could be imposed in all of the circumstances.

The respondent says that he quit his employment at Lilydale Foods, which involved shift work and weekends, so that he could exercise access to his children.
Given that he agreed to pay child support based upon imputed income from his former employment, either he expected to earn comparable income elsewhere (failing which he could return to Lilydale Foods), or he quit to avoid his child support obligation.
[4]               The real issue is whether the respondent is intentionally underemployed or unemployed within the meaning of s. 19(1)(a) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines (SOR/97-175, as am.).
I cannot decide that issue on the basis of the material filed.
I do not know if his former employment remains available or practicable or what efforts he has made to secure alternate employment.
[5]               I am therefore directing a trial of the issue of whether the respondent is intentionally underemployed to be held before me on a date to be set by the local registrar in consultation with counsel.
The onus will be on the respondent to establish that his current employment is commensurate with his ability, experience, training and the market place in which he resides.","FIAT. The father applied to vary the April 2001 consent order, granted 1 month after he quit his employment, by reducing monthly child support payments from $236 to $19.
He agreed to pay support based on an imputed annual income of $17,386, although he remained unemployed.
HELD: A trial of the issue was directed, as it could not be decided on the material filed whether he was intentionally unemployed or underemployed.
The father's circumstances had changed since the consent order.
The fact he no longer resided with a girlfriend and was making payments on a truck did not justify any reduction.

The applicant, Allan Walter Alexander Biggar, seeks to vary the child support provisions contained in a judgment for divorce granted September 17, 1997 to an amount that accords with the Federal Child Support Guidelines [Divorce Act Regulations, SOR/97-175].
BACKGROUND [2]
The applicant and respondent, Bonnie Mary Biggar, married on June 21, 1985.
The agreement provides for child support in a specified amount greater than that provided for in the Guidelines based on the applicant`s current income, an obvious benefit to the children.
However I do not equate this with a ""special provision"" as contemplated by s. 17(6.2) of the Divorce Act given the change in the circumstances of the applicant.
CONCLUSION [21]      (1)
The applicant`s total income is $24,000 per annum;          (2)
The applicant shall pay to the respondent as                and for the support of the two children of the                marriage, Kate Belinda, born November 19, 1988,                and Robyn Claire, born October 4, 1990, the sum                of $341 per month commencing the 1st day of                July, 1998, and continuing on the first day of                each month until further order.
There shall be no order as to costs.                                                                J.","FIAT. The father sought to reduce the support contained in the 1997 divorce judgment which incorporated the parties' interspousal agreements regarding custody, access and child and spousal support.
The parties were married in 1985 and separated in 1995.
The mother was on leave from her employment.
When his federal government management position was declared redundant, the applicant received a retiring allowance of $75,646 in May 1997.
The respondent opposed the application on the basis there had been no change in circumstances since the judgment was granted; she had no other income than the support payments and child tax credit; alternatively, there were special provisions in the parties' separation agreement which would permit the court to award an amount that differs from the amount prescribed by the Guidelines.HELD: 1)The judgment the applicant sought to vary was made after the coming into force of the Guidelines.
It did not however include a determination of child support made in accordance with the Guidelines.
There was no change in the childrens' or mother's circumstances.
The applicant was unemployed but was still benefiting from his retiring allowance at the time of the order which he no longer enjoyed.
A variation was warranted as there had been a change in the father's financial means and circumstances.
The Guideline support obligation for two children is $341 per month.
 2)It could not be concluded on the evidence presented that there was any special provision in the parties' agreement that directly or indirectly benefited either child.
The provision for child support in a specified amount greater than that provided in the Guidelines was not a 'special provision' as contemplated by s17(6.2) of the Divorce Act given the change in circumstances of the applicant whose annual income had dropped from $55,500 to $24,000 a year.
 3)No order was made as to costs.","[75, 1, 73, 72, 4, 3, 2, 69, 70, 74]"

[7]               Counsel for the respondent relies on the decision in The Height of Excellence Financial Planning Group Inc. v. Stanley Eric Dixon, [1999]
S.J. No. 629 (QL); 1999 SKQB 101 (CanLII) (Q.B.) as support for the position that the application should be denied.
Both counsel have agreed that if the applicant succeeds that I should make the order set out below.
         In addition to the relief granted above set forth there will be an order that the respondent shall:
(a)      immediately cease and desist from any and all contact, either direct or indirect, with those clients of TFPG whose account was administered or managed by the said respondent or anyone associated with him or employed by him with a view to soliciting, serving, catering to or attempting to direct away from TFPG such clients or any associate or affiliate of such client, or any person who was a prospective client of TFPG, until further order of the court, saving that the above restriction shall not prevent a client or prospective client of TFPG from, of their own volition, contacting, consulting or engaging in any business with Darcy Bergen and further, the above restriction shall not operate to prevent or hinder Darcy Bergen from advertising his services in any media form or outlet, including seminars.","FIAT. The former registered representative of TFPG was terminated for selling unapproved investments in breach of a Shareholder Advisor Agreement which permitted the sale of TFPG's financial products and services only.
TFPG sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the respondent to return all materials and files respecting TFPG's clients, to cease any contact with its clients, and to make no attempt to solicit any current or prospective client.
HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG.
The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services.
1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.
 2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration.
It was not unconscionable nor against public policy.
The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement.
The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor.
The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm.","[11, 0, 31, 61, 30, 32, 60, 62]"

                                                                   FACTS
[1]               The applicant divorced husband applies to vary the spousal support provisions contained in a separation agreement dated June 18, 1975 (the ""agreement) between he and the respondent, Patricia Margaret Pearson.
He married approximately two years ago.
                                                               ANALYSIS
[5]               In a trilogy of cases the Supreme Court of Canada concluded that in order for a court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement or separation agreement or a consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs be established.
[6]               The decree nisi for divorce dated September 26, 1977, incorporated the support provisions of the separation agreement.
The fact it has now occurred is not that kind of radical unforseen change in circumstance required to be established upon the authorities to support the variation application.
Nor am I persuaded that the respondent's modest income provides any proper ground for variation of the agreement.
She still has a much lower standard of living than the applicant even after taking into account the amount she is receiving as spousal support.
[9]               In all the circumstances and for the reasons stated the variation application is dismissed with costs to the respondent.","FIAT. The husband seeks to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' 1975 separation agreement.
This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first.
The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years.
The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income.
In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement.
At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant.
HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent.
The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established.
Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement.
It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income.
This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support.
The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement.
The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent.
The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support.","[11, 48, 0, 34, 1, 47, 35, 10, 36, 46, 33, 2, 12, 9, 45, 13]"

                                                                      - and -
The statement of claim speaks of malicious prosecution, negligence, breach of Charter rights and conspiracy.
The plaintiff claims general damages, special damages, punitive damages, aggravated damages, interest and costs.
 [12]               Since the action was commenced, and before these applications were brought, several parties were removed from the proceedings.
Statements of defence were filed by all remaining parties.
Statements as to documents have been served and a number of examinations for discovery have been conducted.
The case is to be heard by a jury and is scheduled to commence in some ten months.
Prior to that further examinations for discovery are planned.
Against that background I must decide the stated issues.
                                              THE STATUTORY LIMITATION
 [13]               The applicants submit that with the exception of claims based on malice, the action should be struck because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by The Public Officers' Protection Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. P-40.
In the instant case, I cannot be certain that the limitation period was not extended.
This being so, I should act as suggested by the Court of Appeal.
Accordingly, the application to dismiss the plaintiff's claim as being statute barred should be dismissed.
In these circumstances, I have decided that it is appropriate to award no costs.
                                                             CONCLUSION
(6)       that there will be no costs of these proceedings.","FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.
 The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.
 Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police.
The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die.
The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA).
Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired.
The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute.
HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994.
The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed.
Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial.
It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants.
As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code.
Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue.
The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA.
Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural.
The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA.
The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation.
The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute.
2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed.
The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted.
The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general.
3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings.
The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck.
They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose.
4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches.
The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts.
Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence.
If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection.
A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys.
Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.
 5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component.
An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact.
6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset.
The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended.
It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.
 7)No costs.","[354, 65, 0, 1, 64, 347, 63, 2, 61, 62, 4, 170, 3, 60, 169, 66, 59, 346, 5, 168, 58, 67]"

(c)      Prior to the return date, the plaintiffs’ counsel advised the defendants that the two motions which had been served on them were not, in fact, going to proceed.
[2]               Because of the peculiar circumstances surrounding the three applications, the applications were dismissed.
There was a request by the defendants’ counsel to have the matter addressed by way of costs.
[3]               When I asked counsel for the plaintiffs to speak to the issue of costs on the chamber date, he indicated in open Court that he was under extreme pressure and a lot of stress lately with respect to this file and others and therefore had prepared three motions which were fairly similar to one another and that in his confusion he had filed some and not filed others.
[4]               Given Mr. Tapp’s representation as to the amount of stress that he was presently under, I do not believe it would be appropriate in the circumstances to assess costs against the plaintiffs over the conduct of their counsel or against counsel directly at this time.
Accordingly, I leave this matter to be determined by the trial judge in the course of this action.","FIAT. The issue was whether costs should be assessed against the plaintiffs because the two motions served by the plaintiffs were not filed at the Court House prior to the return date as required by the Queen's Bench Rules;
 the motion filed at the Court House was not served on the defendants; plaintiff's counsel advised the defendants that the two motions which had been served on them were not in fact going to proceed.
HELD: Given the lawyer's representation as to the amount of stress he was under, it would not be appropriate in the circumstances to assess costs against the plaintiffs over the conduct of their counsel or against counsel directly or at this time.
The matter was left to the trial judge.","[0, 29, 1, 2, 3, 26, 28, 4, 25, 5, 27, 24]"

But on the basis of the material filed, I am satisfied that she is capable of earning $15,000 during the year.
Applicants are not entitled to a variation order setting child support at the level that automatically flows from the choices they make respecting their employment and income.
The court must factor in as well, the ability of the applicant to pay a reasonable level of child support.
The applicant is clearly capable of paying more than $17 per month for her three children.
I fix basic child support for the three children under the Guidelines at $250.00 per month based on an imputed annual income of $15,000.
 [5]                   Neither party filed current information respecting the s. 7 expenses which, as claimed by the respondent in 1999, appear to be exorbitant.
I reduce the applicant's share of the s. 7 expenses to $50.00 per month for total ongoing child support of $300.00 per month commencing April 1, 2001.
 [6]                   Had the applicant been more reasonable in her submission for variation, I would have awarded her costs.
In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs.","FIAT. The mother applied to vary the terms of the 1999 child support order under which she was to pay $400 per month composed of $334 for regular support plus $66 for s.7 medical and extraordinary expenses for their three children based on an imputed annual income of $18,000.
She sought to cancel arrears of $3,800 on the basis she will overpay if child support had been calculated in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines on the basis of her actual income for 1999 and 2000.
She also sought to reduce child support to $17 per month based on a projected income of $7,000.
HELD: 1)One-half of the arrears were cancelled.
The mother must accept responsibility in part for allowing arrears to accumulate over the 2 years.
2)The mother was to pay $250 per month based on an imputed income of $15,000.
She was capable of contributing more than $17 per month.
Her share of s.7 expenses was reduced to $50 per month.
Neither filed current information. 3)Costs would have been ordered if the mother had been more reasonable in her submission for variation.","[0, 33, 32, 1, 2, 31, 3, 30, 4, 29, 5, 28, 27, 6, 26, 7, 25]"

The returns indicate that, after adjustments, he had an average gross taxable income of $28,000.00.
However, the file also indicates that his net worth has increased substantially since the original order in 1993.
His financial statement filed that year showed a net worth of $105,744.00 after deducting debts of $352,655.00.
I therefore find that the respondent has a gross annual income imputed at $56,000.00.

He purchased stock totalling $202,061 in 1996 using income generated from the farm.

The creditor objected that the applicant had plenty of opportunity over the years to pay and drew attention to prior allegations of mismanagement or redirection of funds which should have been allocated to the payment of interest.
HELD: The payment which should have been paid in November was to be paid within 7 days.
The remaining payments set out in the schedule will commence January 2001 with the change in rate of interest from that provided under the Interest Act to one equivalent to pre-judgment interest.
A 5 day grace period was allowed after which the respondent was allowed to proceed immediately with enforcement by execution, garnishment or any means it deems appropriate.

146,"The parties were married May 5, 1973 and separated January 4, 1992.
The husband petitioned for divorce and other corollary relief on June 19, 1992.
The wife (applicant herein) counter-petitioned on March 22, 1993 and included in her claim a ""lump sum and periodic spousal support"".
The matter proceeded from there and it is apparent that the parties negotiated a settlement of all of the outstanding issues in the dispute including divorce, custody of the children, division of matrimonial property, and spousal support payable by the husband to the applicant.
There is no suggestion that the agreement was unfairly negotiated or that she was subjected to undue influence or pressure in any way before signing the agreement and was, in fact, advised by counsel before doing so.
I am left with the conclusion that the agreement with respect to spousal maintenance was intended to be final.
In light of those conclusions, I have no alternative but to dismiss the application.
The respondent is seeking costs of the application but in my view while the applicant has failed to make out her case this is not an instance where costs should be granted and I decline to do so.
Each party shall pay their own costs.                                                             J.","FIAT. The parties were married in 1973 and separated in 1992.
The husband petitioned for divorce and corollary relief in 1992.
The wife counter-petitioned in 1993 claiming a 'lump sum and periodic spousal support'.
An interspousal contract entered into 1993 provided for periodic monthly spousal support of $350.
Both acknowledged that they were aware of the nature and effect of the agreement and each had independent legal advice before signing.
The husband paid periodic spousal support until December 1995.
The applicant sought to vary the 1993 order on the grounds there had been a change in circumstances in that her annual income was currently less than half of what it had been at the time the order was made and her economic hardship could be traced to the breakdown of her marriage primarily because his job had required them to move from place to place during the marriage.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
1)The agreement was intended to be final.
While the applicant's income had dropped she had not established that she could not be self-sufficient.
The terms of the agreement which limited the payment of spousal support to December 1995 appeared to be applicable.
The applicant had previously brought a similar variation application even though she earned in excess of $25,000 in 1995.
2)There was no suggestion that the agreement was unfairly negotiated or that she was subjected to undue influence or pressure in any way prior to signing and she had been advised by counsel.
 3)Costs sought by the respondent were refused.","[47, 48, 3, 2, 1, 46, 45, 4, 44]"
147,"The respondent takes the position: 1.
The petition for divorce is a nullity and Saskatchewan courts do not have jurisdiction to hear and determine the divorce proceedings; 2.
The court lacks, or ought to decline to exercise jurisdiction under The Children's Law Act, R.S.S. 1990, c.C-8.1; 3.
If the court accepts and exercises jurisdiction under The Children's Law Act interim custody should be granted to the respondent.
THE DIVORCE ACT             The petition was filed May 31, 1996.
There will be an order that Stefan shall reside with the petitioner on an interim basis and the petitioner shall have care and control of Stefan.
It is a condition of this order that Stefan and the petitioner shall continue to reside with the petitioner's parents in the city of Regina.
In the event that there is to be any change in the petitioner or Stefan's residence the matter is to be brought back before the court for review.
It is a condition of this order that Stefan shall not be removed from the city of Regina without further order of this court.
          In my view it is necessary that this matter move promptly to pre-trial.
The Local Registrar is directed to set an early pre-trial conference date.                                                                J. ","FIAT. The petitioner sought interim custody of his son.
The respondent contested that the petition for divorce was a nullity and Saskatchewan courts did not have jurisdiction to hear the divorce proceedings and lacked jurisdiction or ought to decline to exercise jurisdiction under the Children's Law Act.
Both parties made serious allegations against the other and there was substantial conflict in the affidavit evidence.
HELD: An order for interim custody was granted on the condition the petitioner continued to reside with his parents in Regina and that the child not be removed from Regina without further court order.
1)The respondent did not acquiesce to the child's residing in Saskatchewan such that it may be said he was habitually resident here for the purposes of the Children's Law Act.
 2)The seven factors listed in s15(1)(b) are conjunctive and the petitioner must satisfy them all.
With respect to (iii) a petition for divorce was commenced in July 1996.
3)The child had a real and substantial connection with Saskatchewan and it was appropriate to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to s15(1)(b).
Jurisdiction existed pursuant to s15(3) as the child had a closer connection to Saskatchewan then to Alberta.
Both sets of grandparents and other family members on both sides reside in Saskatchewan.
The child had no connection of consequence to the Province of Alberta.","[49, 1, 50, 2, 48, 47, 3, 4, 46, 5, 45]"

Kennedy                     for the defendant (applicant)                                        The Dow Chemical Company No one appearing                          for the other parties FIAT                                                  GEREIN J. April 24, 1996          The statement of claim in this action was served ex juris upon all the defendants.
At this time the one defendant, The Dow Chemical Company, seeks a declaration that this Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the action insofar as it relates to that particular defendant.
The Court is also asked to set aside the service ex juris.
Thus, here also there is an allegation which suggests a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the plaintiff's injuries.            Accordingly, in respect to both situations, there are allegations which I must assume have a factual basis.
That being so, the statement of claim does disclose wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant, The Dow Chemical Company, and there is a causal connection between that conduct and the alleged damages suffered by the plaintiff.
Accordingly, liability may rest with the defendant, The Dow Chemical Company, in both tort and contract and it is appropriate for this Court to assume jurisdiction in respect to the claim as it relates to the defendant, The Dow Chemical Company.
Conclusion            In the result, the application is dismissed.","FIAT. The plaintiff brought an action against five defendants claiming fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a skin rash were the result of silicone implants.
One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside.
Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause.
It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.
 1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law.
The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province.
2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort.
Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary.
3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties.
4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity.
It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical.
This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship.
If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection.
5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.
 6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered.
Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","[2, 89, 88, 90, 1, 87, 3]"

September 22, 1997          The plaintiffs have applied for an order, pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173, striking out the statement of defence and counterclaim of Jeffrey James South and Karen Joan Rilkoff (the defendants) and the separate statement of defence of Helen Rilkoff.          It has been asserted that the issues raised in the defendants statement of defence, and in the statement of defence of Helen Rilkoff, do not disclose a reasonable defence, nor do the issues in the counterclaim show a reasonable cause of action.          The plaintiffs have also alleged that paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 of the defendants statement of defence, which are incorporated into paragraph 10 of the counterclaim, raise issues which have been dealt with in a final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction and the defendants are therefore barred by the doctrine of res judicata, or  issue estoppel, from pursuing such issues.
Consequently, it has been asserted that the raising of such issues is an abuse of the process of the court.          Finally, it has been submitted that the defendants statement of defence and counterclaim are frivolous, vexatious and otherwise an abuse of the process of the court.
Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve what appeared to be rather serious questions of law.
The consent by the defendants to do so was not forthcoming.          The application of the plaintiffs must therefore be dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause.                                                        J.","FIAT. The plaintiffs applied for an order striking out the statement of defence and counterclaim and separate statement of Helen Rilkoff as not disclosing a reasonable defence or cause of action.
The plaintiffs claimed the doctrine of res judicata applied to the claim for damages by virtue of two Small Claims court judgments in 1989 and 1992.
The defendants asserted their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was different than those previously dealt with.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause.
1)The fact that the plaintiffs filed a 55 page brief in support of their submissions and the defendants filed a 14 page brief in response evidenced that the issues were not easily resolved and certainly not on a summary basis.
 2)An application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justifiable dispute is revealed.
If no facts are in dispute, the parties may resort to Rule 188.
Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve the questions of law.","[18, 1, 17, 0]"

614630 SASKATCHEWAN LTD. and
[3]         During the presentation of the appeal, a discussion arose as to the proper procedure to be followed by a receiver-manager who has arranged a sale of the real property.
The court suggested that the first step was to make application to have the sale approved by the court.
The notice of application should be served upon the registered owner and all other interested parties.
The onus is on the applicant to prove to the court that all such parties have been served.
At para.
6 of the judgment the court goes on to observe:
If the order for sale is approved, the applicant might then or on a later occasion apply for a vesting order.
However, under no circumstances should a vesting order be made unless or until the rights of all interested parties have either been relinquished or have been extinguished by due process.
The application for the vesting order applied for is granted.
The form of the draft order filed with the applicant solicitor’s subsequent submissions dated February 13, 2003, may issue.","FIAT. The receiver manager of the registered owner (the numbered company) under the Bankruptcy Act and the instrument appointed receiver on behalf of the secured creditor and mortgagee (HSBC Bank) applied for a vesting order.
The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year.
HELD: The vesting order was granted.
1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so.
In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87.
2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor.
The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price.
The registered owner had taken no opposition.
No other interests will be adversely affected.
3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment.","[50, 0, 49, 1, 48, 2, 46, 47, 3, 4, 45, 44, 6, 5, 43, 7, 42, 8, 41]"

He testified that in the morning of February 21, 1994 he received a radio call from the Rosthern Detachment advising him of a theft of approximately $50.00 at Trappers Service in Duck Lake.
His assistance was required to intercept a small light blue car with an out-of- province license plate with two native people in it travelling north toward Prince Albert.
He was advised that the driver had tatoos on the back of his hands and the other individual was intoxicated.
He drove toward Duck Lake and met the Rosthern R.C.M.P. detachment officers.
The fairness of the trial will not be affected by the admission of the evidence.
The manner in which the search was conducted was neither abusive nor excessive.
On the contrary, the evidence was in plain view and was found inadvertently.
The evidence is real and tangible.
The admission of this evidence will not have an adverse effect upon the reputation of the administration of justice.          The application to exclude evidence is denied.                                                             J.

HELD: The application to exclude evidence is denied.
1)The officers were lawfully present in the premises when Sergeant Bell inadvertently found the knapsack and its contents which were in plain view.
He reasonably believed that the knapsack and the contents were evidence of a crime.
Therefore it was neither unreasonable nor unlawful for him to seize these items.

This appeal from an order respecting custody and access to children cannot succeed.

Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue.
And in our view he addressed it as required by law.
We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence.
Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a “hard choice”.
He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them.
We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5.
We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access.
The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise.
The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child.","Fulltext of judgment follows:[1]
We do not need to hear from counsel for the respondent.
I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2]
We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith.
As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly.
[3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'.

[2]            For the purposes of this judgment I shall refer to the petitioning father as “G. K.,” to the respondent mother as “C. H.,” and to the maternal grandmother as “J. O.”
                                     ABOUT THE PETITIONER
[3]            G. K. is 26 years old.
Both G. K.’s father and G. K. advise the Court that they will relocate their respective families to the City of Calgary.
She believes Patricia “doesn’t have a wicked bone in her body” and that Patricia “does not like conflict.”
Therefore, Mrs. Kuntz is of the opinion that all of this has been tough on Patricia.
[40]           Under cross-examination Mrs. Kuntz expressed the opinion that C. H. is a “loving mom—though a little mixed-up at times.”
She further opined that for young kids her son and C. H. did fine parenting.
She still considers C. H. as a daughter.
                                    ABOUT HAYLEY’S MOTHER
                  TO HAVE ACCESS WITH THEIR GRANDCHILDREN
[108]         J. O. is Hayley’s maternal grandmother.
As noted earlier, she had the responsibility for raising Hayley for two years before moving to Saskatchewan.
Finally, C. H. is to accommodate J. O. by sharing access with Hayley during one of the weeks in which Hayley is in her mother’s care.

In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her.
The father seeks sole custody.
The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father.
The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver.
HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years.
The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father.
2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found.
3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley.
He must consult with her mother.
The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship.
Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4)
A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated.
That is the first step.
The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest.
It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act.
5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful.
There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to.
An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests.
The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access.","[0, 189, 1, 22, 599, 699, 702, 188, 21, 698, 187, 600, 186, 24, 601, 190, 185, 20]"

Murray R. Sawatzky, Q.C.               for CNH Capital Canada Ltd. and CNH Canada Ltd.
So that, in reading the phrase “specially priced”, one is entitled to expect that the amount asked represents exceptional value.
It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH Canada to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer (ss. 50(22)).
As well, the provisions of s. 50  appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer.
In addition, the supplier is entitled to discount the invoice price, supposedly to compensate for restocking.
            I am not persuaded that the parts in issue in this case were specially ordered.
On that account, the second issue is resolved in favour of the Receiver.
Conclusion
            The Receiver, PwC is entitled to its costs of this motion, one set of costs against CNH Canada and CNH Capital together.
TD, although represented before me, is not a separate  party to the application, notwithstanding that the application is within the procedural framework of its action against Wheatland.
Therefore TD is not entitled to costs.
                                                            J.D. Koch","In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals.
In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR).
Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer.
Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH).
The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH.
The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts.
The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies.
HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for.
The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit.
But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.
 2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue.
It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH.
The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA).
While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act.
The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings.
The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts.
However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances.
It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer.
The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out.
The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer.
The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered.
They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","[197, 195, 196, 1, 198, 192, 193, 3, 191, 0, 189, 5, 4, 194, 2, 6, 187, 10, 186]"

[7]               At trial the Royal Bank's claim was admitted leaving to be tried the matter of the Compain's counter-claim against the Royal Bank for general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages.
          Although there was some argument as to whether or not this or some other credit agreement formed the basis for the credit and loan presently sued upon, no other credit agreement was produced by either party to suggest that an agreement other than the one referred to and marked as Exhibit P-3 existed.
         I conclude that Mr. Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he impliedly had to confidentiality of his credit information.
[29]            I find that the Royal Bank acted fairly and reasonably throughout consistent with its obligations to Mr. Compain and its general banking practices including its report to Equifax as a credit reporting agency.
[30]            In conclusion none of the counter-claimant's claims are upheld and they are dismissed in total.
The plaintiff Royal Bank will have its costs against the defendant (plaintiff by counter-claim) both with respect to the claim and counter-claim which, unless agreed, shall be taxed (pursuant to column II of the Court of Queen's Bench tariff of costs).
         As a final comment it should be noted that consistent with the finding in this judgment that the Royal Bank has throughout acted in good faith and in keeping with its contractual and fiduciary obligations towards Mr. Compain it is expected that the Royal Bank will now proceed to request Equifax to place upon Mr. Compain's credit report as appropriate commentary in the spirit of that proposed in its counsel's letter to Mr. Compain's solicitors April 24, 1997.","In issue was whether the Bank breached its lending contract, its fiduciary duty or duty of confidentiality; and if so, what damages, if any, should be awarded.
The defendant's bank loans fell into default after SGI disability benefits were terminated.
The Bank reported the particulars of the loan defaults to a credit reporting agency (Equifax).
The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans.
The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement.
The bank commenced this action for payment.
The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract.
HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims.
The bank's claim was admitted at trial.
1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement.
The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate.
Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case.
3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business.","[28, 0, 45, 100, 99, 47, 98, 101]"

I am satisfied on the basis of the evidence filed that all the screening measures, with the exception of the computer file segregation occurred prior to the arrival of Ms. Fitzsimmons.
Further, despite the fact that the computer segregation occurred a few days after Ms. Fitzsimmons` arrival, neither Ms. Fitzsimmons nor her assistant had any access to the computer files in question during that time or since.
I am satisfied that the screen is sufficient in the circumstances of this case.
There is not a risk of real mischief in this case.
A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information had occurred or would occur.
In the circumstances, Olive Waller may continue to represent Janie Magnes and D.A.L..
There will be no order as to costs.","In issue was whether the law firm was in a conflict of interest with respect to two matrimonial files and whether the firm could remain as counsel for the spouses.
HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux.
The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm.
At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes.
She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses.
2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case.
There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act.
A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur.
There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening.
Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her.
The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet.
The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter.
The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.","[1, 158, 159, 160, 0, 3, 4, 2, 154, 155, 6, 5, 153, 151]"

Did the parties cohabit for more than 90 days and thereby vitiate their agreement to live separate and apart?
The Facts [2]
The parties signed a contract described as a separation agreement dated September 6, 1996.
It is clear also from the answers given by both parties that when they did reunite, their objective was to be fully reconciled and to re-establish their lives together in the fullest possible context.
The fact that the reconciliation was short lived, regrettably, does not change that result.
Their cohabitation began on June 27, 1997 with their reunion in Wynyard, Saskatchewan and continued until September 30, 1997 when the respondent terminated the reconciliation.
The September 6, 1996 agreement was therefore rendered, in its words, ""void"".
I was disposed to grant costs to the petitioner in this matter in light of the course the evidence took and the outcome, but concluded it would be more appropriate that the costs be dealt with by the trial judge in due course, mindful of the outcome of this particular proceeding.                                                             J.","In issue was whether the parties cohabited for more than 90 days and thereby vitiate their 1996 separation agreement to live separate and apart.
The Agreement provided that neither would claim spousal support.HELD: 1)Credibility was determinative.
The wife was articulate, intelligent and forthright while the husband was found to be evasive, argumentative and untruthful in answering a number of questions including the circumstances surrounding the signing of the agreement, the untrue statements he set out in his divorce petition in Ontario regarding his residency and in applying for default judgment when he knew the petitioner had served an Answer.
2)The agreement was rendered 'void' by the fact the parties cohabited for more than 90 days.

Has the respondent met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting?
I have concluded that the requested relief should be granted in part.
THE  FACTS
[2]                  The respondent, the Town of Nipawin, is a community of some 5,000 people located in northeastern Saskatchewan.
Bylaw 755/99 is in respect to an unrelated project.
I have included it here because its content was also a part of the earlier Bylaw 754/99 as was the content of Bylaw 756/99.
The earlier Bylaw was simply split into the two present ones.
            Public notice of Bylaw 756/99 was published in the Nipawin Journal on August 4, 1999, and notice was given of a public meeting to be held August 30, 1999.
Notice of an intention by Council to consider, on that same day 15 minutes later, a request by Palidwars for a discretionary use was published adjacent to the bylaw notice.
It is this bylaw and the request for approval of a discretionary use, i.e. construction of a hotel, which are under attack in this application.
DISCRETIONARY USE
Day and Mochoruk, a different result may ensue.
CONCLUSION
(4)                  the applicants will have taxable costs of the application, which costs I fix at $400.00.","In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting.
HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw.
The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor.
It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry.
There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest.
Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open.
The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment.
The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion.
5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside.
The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership.
They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation.
No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent.
The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings.
The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","[0, 24, 376, 371, 1, 23, 25, 2, 26, 161, 362, 159, 157, 370, 158, 155, 156]"

[9]            In terms of the payor’s ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation.
It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately one-half of the $300.00 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992.
However one cannot ignore the fact that in 1992 the payor agreed to pay $300.00 per month non-taxable.
He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years.
I am also cognizant of the fact that the petitioner’s farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs.
By reporting a farm loss each year the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay.
In the circumstances I am not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.
On the issue of costs I consider success to have been divided.
There will be no order as to costs.

In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934.
The petitioner is actively engaged in farming.
He pursues reasonable off farm income.
In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income.
He shall pay child support of $221 per month.
 2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation.
It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992.
However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it.
He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years.
The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs.
By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay.
In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.","[66, 0, 65, 1, 64, 2, 63, 3, 62, 4, 5, 61, 6, 60, 59, 7, 8, 58, 57]"

shall be varied in accordance with this Order.
2.                 That the Respondent Dansereau's gross annual income is $22,993.00.
3.                  That the respondent Dansereau of the City of Prince Albert in the Province of Saskatchewan shall pay to the petitioner Thiessen of the city of Saskatoon in the province of Saskatchewan the sum of $325.00 per month for the maintenance of the following children:
Braden Thomas Thiessen, born April 27 1990
Dorian Brooks Thiessen, born Dec. 19, 1992
commencing on the first day of February, 1999 and payable on the first day of each and every month thereafter for so long as they remained children within the meaning of The Act.
4.                 Upon the respondent Dansereau paying the sum of $5000.00 on account of the arrears accrued under the Order as of December 31, 1998, the unpaid arrears accrued to such date shall be extinguished unless otherwise ordered.
That the Maintenance Enforcement Officer for the Province of Saskatchewan shall limit garnishment of the respondent’s wages to $175.00 per month on account of the arrears plus $325.00 per month on account of the current maintenance due.
That the respondent and Dansereau shall have access to the children on the terms heretofore stated.
No costs are awarded to either party.","In the first application under the Family Maintenance Act the father sought to reduce child maintenance of $250 per child per month to an amount in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines; cancellation of arrears of $13,273.39; and increased access.
In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck.
HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.
 2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears.
Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997.
The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997.
Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times.
Upon payment of $5,000 the balance of arrears accrued prior to December 31/98 would be extinguished.
3)The father was to pay child support of $325 per month for the two children.
Garnishment of his wages by the Maintenance Enforcement Office were to be limited to $175 per month for arrears plus the current maintenance due.
4)The parties agreed the father should have access not less than one full weekend per month upon two weeks prior notice plus when he was available to attend at the city in a manner consistent with the children's best interests and their need to be available for school.","[55, 54, 0, 1, 2, 3, 51, 4, 53, 52, 5, 50, 6, 7, 49, 47, 46, 8, 48]"

After judgment, the defendants appealed the judgment.
 The plaintiffs then submitted detailed calculations of the final judgment for the trial judge's review.
The defendants objected to the finalization of the judgment on the ground that, pursuant to Court of Appeal Rule 15, the notice of appeal had stayed the execution of the judgment until the disposition of the appeal.
The plaintiff submitted that the calculation of the judgment was not acting on it.
HELD: The defendant misconstrued the scope of Rule 15 as it does not stay proceedings.
The appeal does not affect the ability of the Court to finalize the judgment.

165,"The petition was issued on February 21, 1995.
There are two children of the marriage, Chad (born in 1976) and Ryan (born in 1978).
The judgment for divorce was granted at the conclusion of the trial.
Karen says she subordinated her employment demands to her family obligations.
It is not unusual in a family situation where both parents are employed that one of the parents must carry out the primary parenting duties.
These duties shift between the parents as the children grow older.
That is what occurred in this family and as the boys got older, Scott became more involved as a parent.
Both Scott and Karen shared the parenting duties in varying degrees throughout the term of the marriage.
In the circumstances, there will be no order for spousal support.          With respect to the matrimonial home, there will be an order that the home shall be sold and the proceeds, if any, divided equally between the parties.
The matrimonial home shall be listed for sale on or before April 1, 1996.
All other contents of the home, other than those ordered at the conclusion of trial to be transferred to Karen, shall vest absolutely in Scott.
There will be no order as to costs.","Issues included the division of a pension, child and spousal support and whether to transfer or have sold the matrimonial home which had a small equity.
The petitioner was an undischarged bankrupt and any funds in his possession belonged to the trustee.
The only marital asset of any value was the petitioner's pension but lump sum payment was not available for five years as there was a liquidity problem.
The parties had been 'spenders' not 'savers'.
HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support for one child.
2)Spousal support was denied.
3)The matrimonial home was to be sold and proceeds were to be divided equally.
 4)Three values were suggested for valuation and distribution of the pension plan.
The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method.
The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP.
The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP.
The respondent was to make the choice between the only two options.
If she wished to have the funds in her name immediately, she was to provide written notification otherwise there would be an order that the respondent is to receive a portion when the monthly pension benefit commences.","[127, 126, 125, 2, 1, 3, 123, 124, 121, 119, 122, 120]"

More particularly, there was no evidence that anyone had lost their job or had been in any way penalized for refusing to either pay union dues or to join the union, nor was there any evidence as to why anyone objected to being a member of the bargaining unit in question or the union in question so as to permit any reasoned decision as to the alleged right not to associate.

[1]               Mr. Kenny is charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with use of a searchlight when hunting.
Specifically, the section reads:
For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife.
[2]               The trial proceeded on the basis of an Agreed Statement of Facts, filed as Exhibit P-1, and the production of five other exhibits.
Upon that occurring, the Crown closed its case, and the sole defence witness was Mr. Kenny.
At the outset, I thank both counsel, and in particular Mr. Loewen and his client, for proceeding in this manner.
Section 79(4) of the Act reads as follows:
[22]           I invite counsel to make their submissions respecting potential forfeiture at this time as to any items that were “seized in connection with the offence”.
[23]           Section 76 speaks to a prohibition period during which a convicted individual cannot apply for or obtain any big game licence, game bird licence, or fur licence, and section 74 of the Act speaks to the monetary penalty for contraventions of the Act or Regulations.

The case was decided on the basis of credibility.
The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused.

[2]               The defendant, on the other hand, has applied for an order setting aside the judgment and striking out the claim of the plaintiff.
[7]               The plaintiff’s damages were assessed in the total amount of $37,717.35, which included punitive damages of $10,000.00.
                                              SECTION 102 OF THE ACT      
(d)  “bodily injury” means any physical or mental injury, including any acquired brain injury, permanent physical or mental impairment or death.
                                             SUBMISSION OF PLAINTIFF
         The plaintiff has asserted that it is common ground that the defendant wilfully drove into the plaintiff, trapping her leg between the defendant’s automobile and a second automobile; that the defendant fled the scene in his automobile calling out of the window of his automobile that the plaintiff was a “dirty little rat”; and that the defendant was tried and convicted of the Criminal Code offence of operating a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public.
         The plaintiff has further submitted that s. 102 cannot have been intended to deprive a citizen of the right to sue a defendant for injuries caused by assault, battery, intentional infliction of mental suffering, fraud, deceit and fraudulent misrepresentation.
Thus, the same result is dictated in this case as in Herbert v. Misuga: the plaintiff had no cause of action by virtue of her injuries having been “caused by an automobile”.
         Consequently, there must be a declaration that the plaintiff was precluded, by s. 102 of the Act, from commencing a valid legal action, with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity.
         There will be no order as to costs.","Plaintiff applied for an order pursuant to s.55 of the AAIA requiring SGI to pay to the plaintiff the amount awarded to her in an earlier judgment.

The plaintiff submits that s.102 of the Act should not deprive a citizen of the right to sue a defendant for injuries caused by assault, battery, fraud, or similar torts.
HELD: The plaintiff has no cause for action by virtue of her injuries having been caused by an automobile.
The plaintiff was precluded by s.102 of the Act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity.

[1]               The plaintiff, as litigation guardian of his four daughters, has alleged that the defendant has wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000.00 to which his daughters are entitled.
                                                       BASIS OF CLAIM
[2]               Mabel Zalys was the mother of the plaintiff and the defendant.
There were two other children: Brian and Wanda Paulmark.
[3]               Bruce and Brian reside in Edmonton.
However, on March 9 or 10, according to Brenda, Mabel told Brenda not to give the money away as she would not have any other funds.
         Brenda never did provide the four $5,000.00 cheque to the granddaughters.
After Mabel’s death Brenda transferred the bank account to a credit union account.
Some of the money was spent for Mabel’s funeral and other expenses.
But there is still over $20,000.00 in the account.
                                                          CONCLUSION
The fact that Brenda did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel’s lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust.
                                                                   COSTS
         The claim of the plaintiff is dismissed, with costs to the defendant, to be taxed on the basis of double column 2.","Plaintiff, as litigation guardian for his four daughters, alleged that the defendant, in breach of a trust, wrongfully retained $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled.
Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account.
Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter.
The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children.
The money was never issued to the granddaughters.
The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters.
HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2.
An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer.
Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust.
She intended to make monetary gifts.

Based on the federal guidelines for Saskatchewan, she would be required to pay $142.00 per month to the father of the children, Cassandra and Anastasia.

The Honourable Mr. Justice Wakeling (in Chambers)
Mr. N. Turcotte for the Appellants
This change of control could well occur as early as July 22nd, when a meeting of the shareholders is scheduled to be held at which time the voting rights of the shareholders will be changed as a result of the order of Kyle J. which is under appeal.
My concern is that if the order is not upheld on appeal, it will be difficult to undo the results of the July 22nd meeting.
I appreciate that banking decisions of importance must be made by the end of this month, but I cannot believe these decisions will not reflect the best interests of the company, as they will be made by the current directors who have the most to lose if they are not made in a sound and business-like fashion.
In the result, the application to lift the stay is dismissed with costs to follow the result of the appeal.

Furthermore, and to a significant extent, the new grounds of appeal are difficult to assess in their entirety, given the material before me.
On the basis of that material, which is incomplete, I am not convinced the grounds relied upon have sufficient merit to satisfy the requirements of clause (a) of the section.
Turning to the public interest, I think the present release of the applicant would be inimical to the public interest, having regard for the whole of the circumstances.
To do so, in my judgment, would tend to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice, given the history of the past proceedings, the current state of the present proceedings, and unlikelihood, as I
see it, of the applicant succeeding either in having all of the convictions set aside or in having the sentence reduced to the time already served.
For essentially these reasons—though I expanded upon them in argument, and in my oral disposition of the application—I decided to dismiss the application for release, without prejudice to further application should leave be granted to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on one or more of the grounds raised in the proceedings.","See also 150 SaskR 185.In 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's sentence appeal and appeal of his 1997 convictions which consisted primarily of sexual offences involving family members and others.
The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years.
The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.
He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal.
The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision.
HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted.
1)The application was premature.
The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months.
The Court of Appeal was not satisfied the appeal as a whole was not frivolous having regard for the requirements of s.679(3)(a) and (c).
Some grounds for appeal would clearly fail such as the ground the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment.
The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess on the basis of the incomplete material before the court.

[1]                  Mary Jane Herman, as guardian of three infant children of a deceased single mother has appealed the decision of Saskatchewan Government Insurance that the children are not entitled to any additional benefits.
                                                               ANALYSIS
[7]                  The relevant portions of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act read as follows:
Subject to subsections (3) to (5), a surviving spouse is entitled to a death benefit calculated in accordance with the following formula:
DB = (50% x IRB)
The income replacement benefit, in this case, is zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s. 146(5) is zero.
[9]                  Section 147 of the Act does not assist Herman.
It merely provides that where there is no surviving spouse or where the deceased victim was, as is the case here, a sole parent, and there is more than one dependant child the surviving spouse death benefit under s. 146(1) is payable for the youngest child and the remaining children become entitled to the additional benefit payable under s.146(5).
Where, however, no  benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s. 146(3) no further amount is payable under either s. 146(5) or s. 147(5).
            The appeal is accordingly dismissed without any order as to costs.","SGI paid $47,427, the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, to the guardian of the three infant children of the deceased single mother.
The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits.
She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident.
Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854.
The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs.
Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5).
It is the total amount payable as a death benefit.
The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero.
Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5).","[0, 59, 25, 26, 27, 58, 1, 12, 56, 28, 57, 55]"

The Honourable Mr. Justice Vancise
The Honourable Mr. Justice Lane
The Honourable Madam Justice Jackson
The clerk sustained no physical injuries.
The appellant then tried again to leave the convenience store with some of the submarine sandwiches while holding a pocket-knife.
He was arrested on the premises.
The Crown concedes this was “technically a robbery” and was at the low end of the scale of seriousness.
We are all of the view the Crown is correct in characterizing the incident as “technically a robbery”.
The appeal against conviction is therefore dismissed.
We also agree with the Crown the robbery was at the low end on a scale of seriousness and what originally would have been a simple shop-lifting became more serious because of the altercation between the clerk and the appellant.
In these circumstances it is appropriate to allow the sentence appeal and to reduce the sentence to one year incarceration with a ten year section 100 order.
The conviction appeal is therefore dismissed, the sentence appeal is allowed and a sentence of one year incarceration is imposed along with a ten year section 100 order.","The 21 year old appealed his conviction of armed robbery, the sentence of three years imprisonment and a ten year s.100 order.
HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed, the sentence appeal was allowed and one year incarceration with a ten year s100 order were imposed.
The Crown was correct in characterizing the incident as technically a robbery which was at the low end of the scale of seriousness.
What originally would have been a shop-lifting became more serious because of the altercation between the clerk and the appellant.","[0, 32, 1, 31, 2, 29, 3, 4, 28, 30, 5, 27, 6, 26, 7, 8, 25, 24]"
179,"The grounds for appeal are as follows: (a)That the conviction was contrary to the law, the evidence and weight of the evidence; (b)That the learned trial judge made an error in law in determining the degree of impairment by alcohol or drug required before a conviction can be entered; (c)Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may allow.
As to the second ground of appeal, the trial judge at p. 281 of the transcript said:         The youth is also charged under count one with driving while impaired on the date in question.
The task of this Court is not to retry the case.
Absent the kind of error alluded to, this Court cannot substitute its opinion for that of the trial judge on questions of fact, and there are no inferences of fact to be deduced from the trial judge's findings of fact which contradict her resolution of the issue before her.             It cannot be said that the findings by the trial judge are not supported by the evidence, or that her conclusions are clearly wrong as to make her decision unreasonable.
The appellant has therefore failed to come within the provisions of s. 686(1)(b)(ii) of the Code.             Likewise, the appellant has not shown an error by the trial judge on a question of law as provided in s. 686(1)(a)(ii).             The appeal is therefore dismissed.                                  ____________________________J.","The accused appealed her conviction on a charge of impaired driving.
The grounds of her appeal were that the trial judge erred in determining that she was impaired, and that the trial judge otherwise misconstrued and misapplied the evidence.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
 1)Both grounds of appeal raised questions of fact.
Findings of fact are not to be reversed on appeal unless it can be established that the trial judge has made some palpable and overriding error which affected her assessment of the facts. 2)The Court's task is not to retry the case or substitute its own decision.
A trial judge's findings of fact can only be overturned if they are so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable.
3)The Court was unable to say that an error of that kind was made by the trial judge in this case.","[22, 20, 1, 2, 21]"
180,"On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of appeal (a)   may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that (i)   the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence, (ii)  the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or (iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice.
. . .          The notice of appeal cites six grounds, one of them an alleged violation of the Charter.
There is an added catch all ""any other grounds that may appear from a reading of the transcript"".          There is no mention in the notice of appeal, at least in the language of the section, of any of the grounds set out in ss. 686(1)(a).
The right of the Appeal Court to set aside a conviction on the evidence is set out in Section 613(1)(a)(i) - namely that the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.
The Court of Appeal cannot and should not set aside a conviction merely because it would have taken a different view of the evidence than did the trial Judge.
The Court of Appeal must remember that it is neither its duty or its function to re-try cases its function is one of review.
See the judgment of Branca, J.A., in R. v. Dhillon (1973), 1972 CanLII 1356 (BC CA), 9 C.C.C. (2d) 414, for a correct statement of the principles to be followed and a very helpful review of authorities.          The appeal is dismissed.                                                             J.","The accused appealed his conviction by a Provincial Court Judge on a charge of impaired driving.
The accused argued that the Crown had failed to make proper disclosure contrary to s.7 of the Charter and that the trial judge has misapplied the concept of reasonable doubt.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
1)The failure of the Crown to disclose was not raised at trial as it should have been.
If the matter had been raised at trial and the judge then thought that the evidence not disclosed impacted the accused's defence, he could have adjourned the trial.
2)The evidence not disclosed would not have affected the accused's defence in any event.
3)On the issue of reasonable doubt, the trial judge could reasonably have convicted on the evidence, and the Court would therefore not substitute its own view of the evidence.","[2, 61, 60, 63, 3, 59, 1]"

5)                 Participating in the activities of a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.11 of the Code.
         Counsel for the Crown contends that only if both warrants are found to be invalid is s. 24 of the Charter engaged.
Had that been the only ground of objection the court would have ruled the warrant valid.
Charter s. 24(2)
         Sections 8 and 24 of the Charter provide as follows:
8         Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.
Anyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this Charter, have been infringed or denied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances.
         As Lamer C.J.C. commented in R. v. Jenereau, 1992 CanLII 117 (SCC), [1992]
1 S.C.R. 259 “For these reasons, in my opinion, the exclusion, rather than the admission of the impugned evidence would have brought the administration of justice to disrepute”.
This is the same conclusion I have reached with respect to the evidence obtained in all of the circumstances of this case.
Therefore, the application of the accused to exclude the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter is dismissed.","The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search.
The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights.
HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.
 1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid.
That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2)
The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued.
The search was therefore warrantless.
3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair.
4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants.
The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA.
The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis.
5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.","[11, 0, 237, 174, 175, 235, 176, 173, 234, 36, 177, 233, 66]"

E. Kalenith, P.C.J.                                       JUDGMENT
INTRODUCTION
My reasons follow.
SUMMARY
(f) Date of release on undertaking to second trial date - fifteen months, three days.
ANALYSIS
In deciding whether the right to trial within a reasonable time, as guaranteed by section 11(b) of the Charter, has been infringed I consider the factors outlined by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Morin (1992) 1992 CanLII 89 (SCC), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 1(“Morin”):
(a) Length of delay;
(b) Waiver of time period;
(c) Reasons for the delay, including:
(i) inherent time requirements;
(ii) actions of the accused;
The Crown argues, and I agree, that as there is no evidence of any efforts by the accused to overcome this I should  find that this prejudice is something that the accused could overcome.
I also agree with the Crown’s argument that the possible difficulty in having access to the children is a normal consequence of being charged with an offence of domestic violence.
These offences occurred on July 5, 2003, July 23, 2003, and January 29, 2004.
These offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter proceeding to trial, and there is no evidence about how this causes the accused an undue hardship which is different from that faced by other accused charged with similar offences.
CONCLUSION
The application is therefore denied.","The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time.
The accused was charged on July 3, 2003 with common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code, threatening to use weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Code, and destroying property of value less than $5,000 contrary to s. 430(4) of the Code.
On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court.
The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources.
On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004.
On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004.
HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed.
1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months.
This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry.
2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children.
There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this.
3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking.
As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused.
3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence.","[88, 82, 36, 1, 80, 38, 8, 79, 35, 39, 12, 40, 9, 77, 41, 37, 28, 42, 76]"

[2]               By letter dated June 28, 2010, the accused had also given notice that he is seeking an order excluding evidence, pursuant to s. 24 of the Charter.
He had alleged in that regard, a breach of his rights to counsel of choice under s. 10(b) of the Charter.
At the conclusion of the voir dire evidence, the accused abandoned his Charter application under ss. 8 and 9 thereof.
In that same vein, the accused was clear and unequivocal in his waiver of rights to counsel.
In the alternative, the accused had failed to indicate a desire to exercise his right to counsel as required in item 4 in R. v. Luong, supra.
[38]           In light of the accused having failed to establish that his rights to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been breached, there will be no consideration of a potential remedy under s. 24 of the Charter.
The application herein by the accused is dismissed and we will need to reconvene court to determine whether the trial needs to continue on any other outstanding issue.","The accused asserted that his rights to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached because the police officer did not bring a list of lawyers to the accused's attention and the accused did not have access to it.
The officer may not have drawn the presence of a telephone book to the accused's attention.
The officer dialed the number for Legal Aid duty counsel for the accused and the accused spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel prior to providing breath samples of 190 milligrams and 180 milligrams.
The accused never indicated that he wished to contact other counsel.
HELD: Following a voir dire, the accused's application to exclude evidence was dismissed.
The accused had not succeeded in establishing on a balance of probabilities that the accused's right to consult counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been violated.
The accused was entirely disinterested in consulting with counsel as was his right and was clear and unequivocal in his waiver of rights to counsel.
Alternatively, the accused failed to indicate a desire to exercise his right to counsel.","[280, 277, 13, 281, 278, 12, 17, 14]"

The accused is charged with the offence of aggravated assault on Victor McKay on February 21, 2008.
At the trial, Crown counsel called six witnesses to testify, and, during the course of the evidence of the sixth witness, requested that the court enter into a voir dire.
The remedies sought were, firstly, a stay of proceedings regarding the charges before the court, or, in the alternative, the exclusion of evidence obtained from the accused while he was being held in detention at the Saskatoon Police Service building.
By agreement of counsel, all of the evidence taken on the trial proper was made applicable to the voir dire.
There is no suggestion in the evidence before me that the accused misunderstood his actual status in any way, or that he was prejudiced by the “un-arrest”.
The accused has not established that he was the subject of “unreasonable search or seizure” resulting in a violation of his rights under the Charter.
There is no reason to consider a remedy under section 24 (2) of the Charter.
Any relevant evidence obtained by Sergeant Johnson is admissible according to the ordinary rules of evidence.
    Wilfrid K. Tucker, J","The accused is charged with aggravated assault.
A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached.
HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights.
1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel.
The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead.
When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'.
The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel.
There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.
 2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest.
It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'.
It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused.
The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release.
The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station.
The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest.
3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'.
The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","[9, 184, 11, 13, 182, 0, 183, 16, 185, 181, 15]"

D.A. LAVOIE, PCJ                                 JUDGMENT
[1]               The accused stands charged as follows:
[2]               The trial of this matter evolved over an extended period of time.
Defence eventually called no evidence and the matter proceeded to closing arguments.
[37]           Having found as above, there is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis, Exhibit P1 in these proceedings.
[38]           Accordingly, the court finds the accused guilty of count 2, being care or control with a blood alcohol content in excess of .08.
[39]           As to count 1, care or control while impaired, the evidence clearly does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt, as envisaged by the case law, including:
R. v. Landes (1997), 1997 CanLII 11314 (SK QB), 161 Sask. R. 305
R. v. Huot (No. 3) (2001), 2001 CanLII 368 (SK PC), 209 Sask. R. 171 (Prov. Ct.)
R. v. Stellato (1993) 1993 CanLII 3375 (ON CA), 12 O.R. (3d) 90 (C.A.), aff’d 1994 CanLII 94 (SCC), [1994]
[40]           In addition, Crown counsel indicated they had no submission to make in relation to this count.
The court finds the accused not guilty of count 1, being impaired care or control.
________________________, PCJ","The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code.
HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis.
Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08.
The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.
 1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch.
The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public.
The Court reviewed the cases.
The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat.
He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene.
Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle.
There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'.
The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle.
2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.
 3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused.
Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand.
In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation.
3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation.
He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief.
The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code.
The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath.
All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private.
After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer.
Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer.
He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests.
Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right.
To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite.
The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","[195, 194, 193, 7, 4, 6, 9, 10, 5, 191, 189, 190, 8, 188, 13, 192, 185, 15]"

Information # 35870650
                            IN THE PROVINCIAL COURT OF SASKATCHEWAN
The Crown elected to proceed summarily.
Interpretation of the Law
It has often been held that the court must look at the “totality of the circumstances”
(Park at 848) to determine if an air of reality to the defence exists.
A helpful guide to the analysis that a court must undertake was provided by Major J. in Ewanchuk at 359-361.
Analysis
I am satisfied that touching did occur in courtroom #10 and that the accused compelled T.D. to touch him and there can be no doubt that the touching had a sexual nature.
The accused’s conduct was spontaneous and carried out without any advance notice to the complainant and without her consent.
The actus reus with regards to the first incident has been made out.
He was oblivious to whether the complainant wished to engage in the conduct and he sought only his own sexual satisfaction.
Therefore I am satisfied that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused sexually assaulted the complainant in both courtroom #10 and in the Youth Court general office.
He is guilty as charged.
I will now hear from counsel on the matter of sentencing.","The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code.
The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police.
In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace.
The Crown proceeded summarily.
The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch.
The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her.
The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence.
HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office.
1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature.
The complainant did not consent to the contact.
2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature.
The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious.
However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace.
He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison.
When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic.
The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity.
Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact.
The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","[2, 406, 366, 367, 405, 368, 0, 404, 3, 298, 403, 14, 365, 369, 364, 363]"
189,"and
D. MacKinnon, for the Accused
As there was no evidence before the Court of the undertaking alleged in Counts 1 and 2, the accused is not guilty of those two charges.
FACTS
The evidence with respect to Counts 3 and 4 is as follows:
The accused had been drinking alcoholic beverages at a house party which ended in the early morning.
The accused estimated that it took approximately ten minutes for her to park the vehicle.
The accused testified that she was not really feeling the effects of the alcohol until she arrived at the police station.
At the 711 she said, “there was not too much time for the alcohol to hit me.”
She said “a few feet, I felt confident enough to drive.”
ANALYSIS
(1)               Admissibility of the Certificate of Analyses
When I consider those explanations together with the uncertainty of the police officer as to whether or not she had alcohol in her system at the time she read her the ASD demand, I am unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.
CONCLUSION
V.H. MEEKMA, PCJ","The accused is charged with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and impaired driving contrary to s. s. 253(b) and 255(1) of the Code.
HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.
 1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it.
Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand.
There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith.
The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached.
2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand.
The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system.
When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving.
The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand.
The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.
As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).
 3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle.
She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station.
She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired.
The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving.
There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","[9, 0, 103, 101, 64, 63, 62, 10, 74, 12, 61, 1, 11, 75, 100]"

I find that the jurisdiction for determination of interim judicial release of a young person charged with murder under the Youth Criminal Justice Act rests solely with the superior court of criminal jurisdiction which in the Province of Saskatchewan is the Court of Queen’s Bench.
Whether this honourable court has jurisdiction to conduct a review of the Youth Court judge’s decision.
Having found that the learned Provincial Court judge under s. 13(2) was not a Youth Justice Court judge for an offence as set out in s.469 of the Criminal Code I am satisfied that the provisions of s. 33 (1) of the Act apply which say the following:
If an order is made under section 515 (judicial interim release) of the Criminal Code in respect of a young person by a justice who is not a youth justice court judge, an application may, at any time after the order is made, be made to a youth justice court for the release from or detention in custody of the young person, as the case may be, and the youth justice court shall hear the matter as an original application.
Therefore I will proceed to hear this matter as an original application.","The accused made an application to the Court of Queen's Bench under s. 515 of the Criminal Code and s. 33(8) and s. 13(2) of The Youth Criminal Justice Act for interim judicial release of the accused pending his preliminary inquiry on a charge of murder.
The accused had previously applied to a Provincial Court judge, who had declined the accused's application.
The issue was whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused's application for judicial interim release.

The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle.
The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people.
One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head.
The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat.

The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down.
After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley.
The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth.
He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work.
The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision.
At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age.
He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty.
His parents were separated.
He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence.
He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats.
He had served five open custody sentences.
HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence.
The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim.
The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors.
In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court.
The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation.
He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision.
The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused.
A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody.
Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","[1, 2, 217, 215, 213, 3, 8, 10, 4, 216, 7, 5, 6, 211, 210, 214, 206, 12, 204]"

COUNT 4        Incarceration for one year and six months, consecutive to the preceding sentence.
COUNT 5        Incarceration for two years, concurrent with the preceding sentences.
Payment of the surcharge was waived as the accused had no income and would not have any for some time.
What follows are the reasons for the sentence imposed.
                                                 THE FACTS
In this case the conduct of the accused is most unusual, even bizarre, as it occurred while the accused was in prison.
It would have been greater but for the fact that some of the larger items were recovered.
                                              THE ACCUSED
                                                 ANALYSIS
[15]           The gravity of the offences is very high because of a number of aggravating circumstances.
The most obvious one is the dollar value of the goods and services realized and the total deprivation inflicted.
However, that has not brought about a combined sentence which is unduly long or harsh taking into account all of the circumstances.
[23]           In the end, it is denunciation and deterrence, both of the accused and others, which must be emphasized and obtain a priority.
Any other approach would being the administration of justice into disrepute.
                                              CONCLUSION
                                                                                                W. F. GEREIN","The accused plead guilty to one count of using credit card data to fraudulently obtain services contrary to s. 342(3) of the Criminal Code, one count of fraud over $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1) of the Criminal Code for defrauding Sasktel of telephone services and one count of fraudulently personating various persons with intent to gain advantage for himself contrary to s. 403(a) of the Criminal Code.
The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences.
The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names.
He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services.
The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44.
The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items.
The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18.
The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail.
He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders.
In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities.
He plead guilty.
HELD: A fit sentence in global terms for these offences would be 8 years and 6 months.
The accused was given credit for 4 years and 9 months for the time he spent in custody.
The accused was sentenced to 2 years and 3 months for the s. 342(3) offence, 1 year and 6 months consecutive for the offence under s. 380(1) and 2 years concurrent for the personation offence under s. 403(a).
The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused.
The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors.
In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea.
The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","[25, 0, 129, 131, 1, 24, 23, 2, 128, 98, 42, 99, 26, 22, 3, 127, 43, 27, 21, 126, 100]"

       C.A. SNELL Q.C., for the Respondent
       Appeal Heard:               May 4, 1995
The sentence of one year under these circumstances, even with the record of the appellant, is excessive.
In addition, it will no doubt mean the appellant would lose his current employment upon which the family is reliant.
       We are mindful of the fact the Crown and defence counsel recommended a fine and probation, but we must also be aware of the view the trial judge took of the appellant's conduct and accept that some degree of incarceration is appropriate given the position of authority he enjoyed and the existence of his past criminal record even though it does not include similar instances of violence.
We therefore conclude the appeal should be allowed and a sentence of 60 days intermittent be substituted for the sentence of one year.
The sentence to commence at 5:00 p.m. on Friday May 12th with release each Monday morning after the weekend.
The probation order is to remain unchanged except to substitute the word `approved' for `supervised' in the first condition.

IV.      ANALYSIS
A.                 Does the defence of self defence apply to the accused in relation to the aggravated assault charge?
The issue as to whether or not the accused can be convicted of an aggravated assault in these particular circumstances can be resolved easily, in my view, by a review of the facts of the case.
[25]           It is clear, as I had mentioned earlier that the accused assaulted Cst. Hujber.
Where there are contradictory reports within the Crown’s evidence of a matter that is essential to the Crown’s case, and I have some doubt about such evidence, I must acquit.
Even if one of the 3 versions of the particulars of the communication issue is correct, in the heat of the moment, there is some doubt in my mind as to whether or not the accused heard that communication.
He certainly did not change his actions towards the officer if he did hear it.
V.        CONCLUSION
[45]           Therefore I am left, having considered the totality of the evidence without any reasonable doubt as to the accused’s guilt on count #1.
S.D. Loewen, J
R. v. Godin, 1994 CanLII 97 (SCC), [1994]","The accused was a passenger in a van where the driver was stunting on the complainant's street.
The complainant was an off duty police officer who left his home and knocked on the passenger window.
The accused exited the van and assaulted the complainant resulting in the complainant receiving a broken nose and ankle.
The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer.
The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident.
HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer.
1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed.
Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.
 2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other.
The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer.","[150, 139, 8, 0, 138, 140, 137, 79, 78, 80, 136, 149, 82]"
195,"In argument questions were raised as to the sufficiency of the evidence in respect of the copy which was given to the accused.          In a number of cases where the method adopted by the police officer of creating the copy has been the subject of questioning and has been found to be deficient, courts have refused to admit the certificate of analyses.
In the case at bar, the judge said:    The Court in this instance in [sic] unable to infer that a true copy was indeed served, failing the proof by the police officer by way of his testimony that he did compare the two.
It's incumbent upon the police officer, be it carbon copy or indeed one of these new -- new types of Certificates with the copies, he still is required to compare, because there are typed versions.
There is no reason to elevate the requirement beyond that level of importance.          I was asked notwithstanding the above finding of error of law to consider whether, in the circumstances the police officer was justified in stopping the respondent's vehicle.
He had heard the noise of squealing tires and saw the vehicle shortly thereafter.
The appellant is entitled to a new trial.                                                             J.","The accused was acquitted on a charge of operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drugs and while his blood alcohol level exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood when questions were raised as to the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to the copy of the certificate of analysis.
HELD: 1)Section 258(7) has been judicially amended to mean 'true copy' which presumably, though not logically, means something more than 'copy'.
It has grown to the point that an affidavit may be disregarded if the police do not provide supplemental evidence when challenged as to the manner in which they assured the accuracy of the copy.
2)The trial judge further advanced the law to a point where, even when not challenged, there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit.
This is an error of law.
A challenge under s258(7) should be based upon a discovered difference as between the copy and the original.
Otherwise the refusal to admit the certificate becomes merely a prize in a procedural game which can only bring the justice system into disrepute.
3)A new trial was ordered to determine whether the stop was justified.","[35, 2, 3, 32, 33, 1]"

P.S. Kolenick, PCJ                             JUDGMENT                                       June 22, 2007
The accused is charged that he did, on or about February 17, 2006, at Saskatoon, drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then.
The alleged driving occurred when the accused was involved in a motor vehicle accident and engaged in other alleged misconduct, including driving without due care and consideration for others, and failing to identify himself to the other driver before departing from the scene.
As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope.
Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer.
In the meantime, it was unfortunate the updated status of the suspension had not been conveyed by S.G.I. in the normal course, any earlier that it actually was.
Therefore, applying the principles in McKenzie supra, while I do not necessarily believe the evidence of the accused I am left in reasonable doubt by it.
As such the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.
____________________________, PCJ","The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then.
The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification?
HELD: The accused is not guilty.
1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration.
Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2)
The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time.
Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later.
At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief.
Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision.
As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope.
Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer.
As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","[78, 77, 4, 5, 76, 7, 6, 75, 8, 74, 9, 73, 10]"
197,"               QUEEN’S BENCH FOR SASKATCHEWAN
For the reasons which follow, I find that the evidence must be excluded.
         Seriousness of the Charter-infringing conduct
[91]           At this first stage, the court considers the nature of the police conduct that infringed the Charter and led to the discovery of the evidence.
The more severe or deliberate the state conduct that led to the Charter violation, the greater the need for the courts to dissociate themselves from it by excluding evidence in order to preserve public confidence in and ensure state adherence to the rule of law.
The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest.
[2]           The Crown asks the court to infer that the accused became more nervous at that point because he was carrying illegal drugs.
The defence asks the court to infer that the accused became more nervous at that point because he had just been asked to disclose when he had last committed a criminal offence.
See R. v. Yeh 2009 SKCA 112 (CanLII), 337 Sask. R. 1 (C.A.) at para.
[4]           “VIN tampering” is not an offence known to either the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 or a Statute of Saskatchewan.","The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles.
The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars.
The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000.
The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times.
The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol.
The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol.
The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver.
Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome.
The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous.
The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs.
The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new.
He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match.
He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match.
The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen.
The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property.
As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified.
A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome.
The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs.
The accused was arrested for trafficking.
The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking.
Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment.
That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer.
The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2).
HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled.
The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to.
The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen.
The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs.
The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification.
He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query.
Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband.
In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition.
The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8.
By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs.
However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog.
Section 9 Ã» 
The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused.
He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen.
His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent.
The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property.
The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property.
The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property.
Section 10 Ã» 
The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion.
However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer.
There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs.
The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2).
The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious.
The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest.
His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements.
The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious.
These two factors favor excluding the evidence.
The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs.
The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case.
The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence.
On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","[0, 14, 373, 465, 374, 463, 375, 377, 460, 461]"

Has there been a failure to disclose on the part of the Crown?
6.                     In my view there has been a failure to disclose.
That lawyer should have sat through the entire Crown case in order to be as effective as possible in the cross-examination.
Indeed that lawyer might have had to have taken over the case entirely in order to be sure to protect the interests of both Mr. Whitecap and Mr. Lathlin.
In my view, the only appropriate remedy is to refuse to allow the Crown to call this witness.

Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace.

Similarly, there is no doubt that the accused drove the truck toward Bear who was lying on the concrete and Darnell who was assisting Bear.
[38]           It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered.
The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public.
The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct.
[39]           Given the evidence which I accept, the accused operated the motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public and the Crown has proven each and every ingredient of this offence to my satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt and I find the accused guilty of this charge.
[40]           I accept the evidence of Darnell and that of Conlee with respect to Counts No. 4 and 5 of the indictment.
Conversely I do not accept the evidence of the accused that he did not strike both Darnell and Conlee.
On the evidence, the Crown has proven the guilt of the accused to my satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt on both Counts No. 4 and 5 and therefore I find the accused guilty as charged on those counts.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code; assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Code; dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Code; and two counts of assault contrary to s. 266(a) of the Code.
HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict.
2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant.
The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result,
the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm.
3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter.
It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered.
The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public.
The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct.
The offence of dangerous driving was established and the accused was found guilty.
4) The accused was found guilty of two counts of assault.","[114, 115, 0, 113, 1, 111, 2, 3, 110, 4, 108, 109, 107, 7, 112]"

Mr. Mervin Shaw, Q.C.                                                                                             For the Accused
Background
[1]               The accused, Karyn Mae Fayant is charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window, and with an aggravated assault upon Joe Cwynar.
The major issue for determination is whether the accused can be convicted of the charge of aggravated assault, or whether she should be convicted of one of the lesser and included offences.
Evidence
[2]               The complainant, Joe Cwynar, testified that he and the accused have been in an on and off relationship since March 2004.
The section pertains to an assault that has the consequences of wounding, maiming or disfiguring.
This result flows from the decisions of the Court in R. v. DeSousa and R. v. Creighton.
In this case, I’ve already concluded that Ms. Fayant intentionally struct Mr. Cwynar in the face with a hard plastic object.
In my view, when an individual intentionally strikes another in the facial area with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result.
As a result, I must conclude that Ms. Fayant is guilty of the charge of aggravated assault.
[25]           Dated at Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, this 17th day of January, 2011.
D.J. Kovatch, J","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief.
The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder.
The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later.
The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument.
The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder.
The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist.
In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember.
The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window.
HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault.
The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder.
The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim.
When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result.
The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","[10, 141, 0, 139, 140, 12, 11, 13, 8, 14, 137, 138, 136, 135]"

ISSUES
Was there a valid revocation and prohibition?
[17]           As previously stated, this is a side issue and irrelevant to the constitutional issue.
However, if defence is correct and Mr. Callele had no authority to prohibit Mr. Paulsen from applying for a fishing licence, counts 1, 2 and 3 must fail and the burden of proof issue under section 35 becomes irrelevant.
If there was no valid prohibition, Mr. Paulsen possessed a valid licence and did not fish or possess fish except in accordance with that valid licence.
[18]           Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan), 1994 states as follows:
(a)  any provision of this Act;
If the Crown bears the onus, whether on a reasonable doubt standard or on a balance of probabilities, they have failed to meet it.
If the accused bears the burden, he has met it through the Crown’s evidence.
Mr. Paulsen had a licence, valid on its face.
He acted in compliance with that licence.
There was no valid section 27 revocation or prohibition in place so as to invalidate his licence.
Counts 1, 2 and 3 are dismissed.
[27]           Therefore, I do not have to decide the constitutional question, as it is moot, and I decline to do so.

Daunt, J","The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations.
The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional.
The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license.
A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch.
The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one.
The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations.
The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door.
The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door.
HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations.
Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act.
The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.'
Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail.
There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act.

             Pursuant to Section 267(b) of the Criminal Code, a person must cause bodily harm.
             In R.v. Smithers, (1978), 1977 CanLII 7 (SCC), 34 C.C.C. (2d) 427, on a charge of manslaughter where it was alleged that the accused, Smithers, had kicked the victim in the stomach, Smithers’ counsel submitted that the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a kick of Smithers caused the death of the accused.
Dickson, J., stated as follows:
The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to the accused in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions.
As well, similar to those decisions, a very short period of time elapsed between the assault and the bodily harm.
They are, to quote the Samuelson decision: “closely related in time and otherwise”.
             Therefore, although I have some empathy for the accused reaction to the Brown’s cheering “kill him, kill #57"" while his son was down on the ice, provocation not being a defence, I must find this accused guilty as charged.

HELD: The accused was found guilty.
 1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed.
Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm.
The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm.
2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him.
The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm.
While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused.
It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up.
The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions.

[2]               The Crown called one witness, Moose Jaw peace officer Cst. Sheldon McNaughton.
The evidence is straightforward and basically uncontradicted.
[4]               At approximately 8:00 a.m., the officer observed a black Mustang vehicle accelerate quickly from a red light at the intersection of Thatcher Drive West and Woodlily East.
The police officer was stopped behind the Mustang.
Both vehicles were travelling west.
There was no other evidence as to an explanation for the excessive speed.
The only conclusion that the Court can draw is that this driving action was planned and deliberate.
Therefore, the mens rea is inferred from the driving conduct.
[29]           I can reach no other conclusion other than the accused voluntarily undertook to drive his vehicle and accelerate to this rate of speed on this stretch of road.
While the speed of one hundred and forty kilometres per hour was for a short period of time, in my view such conduct is a “marked departure” from the standard expected for a reasonably prudent driver.
I do not have any reasonable doubt that the accused was driving dangerously.
Mr. Huseini is guilty as charged.
Dated at Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, this 5th day of October, 2011.
M.T. Gordon, J","The accused was charged with dangerous driving.
The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light.
The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr.
The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr.
The intersection was near a church and school yard.
There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred.
HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving.
The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway.

ISSUES AND ANALYSIS
Is it a requirement of subparagraph 258(1)(g)(i) that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model?
The pertinent portion of the subject section reads as follows:
In any proceedings under subsection 255(1) in respect of an offence committed under section 253 or in any proceedings under subsection 255(2) or (3),
(g) where samples of the breath of the accused have been taken pursuant to a demand made under subsection 254(3), a certificate of a qualified technician stating
Moreover, she did not state the model, and there are three different models of Intoxilyzer that are designated.
There may well be other Intoxilyzer models that are not designated.
Her evidence does not adequately advance the Crown’s case in this respect.
Accordingly, other evidence does not sufficiently identify the approved instrument as to make and model.
It follows that the Crown cannot rely upon paragraph 258(1)(g) and accordingly there is no evidence of the accused’s blood alcohol level.
CONCLUSION
The charge is dismissed.","The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08.
The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level.
The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'.
There was no symbol with it.
In the blank that followed was written '5000C'.
This change was not initialed.
The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model.
HELD: The charge was dismissed.
The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level.
1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.
 2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration.
The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown.
If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly.
In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","[86, 82, 81, 40, 41, 80, 79, 42, 43, 5, 39, 78, 44, 6, 77, 38]"

The Charge 
Background 
The accused stands charged that on or about the 16th day of July 2001, at Manitou Beach, in the Province of Saskatchewan, did ...
""while her ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug, operate a motor vehicle contrary to section 253(a) and section 255(1) of the Criminal Code
And
Objectively, these grounds alone cannot support a conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.
A useful review in regard to this issue can be found in R. v. McDarby [1998]
O.J. No. 2443 (Ont. Gen. Div.) and R. v. Trory [1998]
For all of the foregoing reasons, the defence application to exclude the Certificate of Analyses based upon a breach of ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter is granted, pursuant to s. 24(2).
Accordingly, there being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the second count, same is dismissed against the accused.
The court will now entertain submissions from Crown and defence as to the resumption of the trial in regard to the first count of impaired driving.","The accused was charged with driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code.
At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand.
HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted.
There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.
 1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'.
The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand.
2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made.
The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case.
The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion.
The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","[0, 2, 7, 86, 8, 87, 9, 84, 85, 10, 11, 83, 82, 12, 13]"
206,"At issue is whether the accused advanced a ""lawful excuse"".          This is what happened.
The accused was charged with an impaired driving offence.
He attended court and indicated he would be retaining a lawyer.
The judge set a return date and informed the accused he must appear personally because the Crown was proceeding by indictment.
On the return date the accused did not show up, so the present charge was laid.          At his trial the accused offered an explanation for his absence.
If Parliament does not give some indication that it has assigned a particular meaning to ""excuse"", the word will be taken to have the same meaning as ""excuse"" under the common law and in s. 7(3) [now s. 8(3)].          In my view Holmes does not assist the accused.
Essentially, the issue of lawful excuse is fact driven.
The guidelines in R. v. Andres (1982) 1979 CanLII 2238 (SK CA), 2 W.W.R. 249 apply.          To paraphrase Andres, I cannot say the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor can I say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.          The appeal against conviction is dismissed.
The accused's appeal against sentence was abandoned.                                                             J.","The accused was charged with failing to appear at his trial on a charge of impaired driving.
The impaired driving charge was subsequently stayed.
When the charge of failing to appear came on for trial the accused claimed a 'lawful excuse' for his failure to appear on the impaired driving charge.
His excuse was that the next shift at work had failed to arrive on time and that this had made it impossible for him to get to court on time.
This excuse was rejected and he was convicted.
He appealed.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
 1)Whether an accused has a lawful excuse is determined with reference to common law principles.
It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability.
2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.","[28, 1, 2, 26, 3, 27, 4, 25, 5]"

Here, unfortunately, the Crown did not allege the proper statute (The Traffic Safety Act) or the correct section number (ss. 113 and 275 of The Traffic Safety Act).
Looking at s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations, 1987, on its own, does not provide the accused with fair notice of the charge that he faces or the penalty that he faces for the contravention.
Accordingly, the charge is a nullity and is void ab initio.
Because it is a nullity, the count cannot be amended so as to breathe life into something that is a nullity.
The appeal is allowed, and the conviction is quashed.
            It should also be noted that the certificate of offence provided a voluntary payment of $105.00.
The Summary Offences Procedure Regulations, 1991 permits a person, to whom a ticket is issued, to accept responsibility by making a voluntary payment in the prescribed amount in certain cases.
There does not appear to be the legislative authority for the utilization of a voluntary payment for an alleged violation of operating a motor vehicle on a public highway which has after‑market tinted side windows regardless of the way the charge was framed.
            There will be no order as to costs.

He appealed on other grounds.
The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion.
The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations.
HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established.
Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty.
The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations.
The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio.

The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle.
HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8.
The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle.
The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious.
Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code.
However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis.
The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain.
The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights.
The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis.
The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision.
There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle.
The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08.
The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.","[8, 0, 14, 11, 10, 366, 16, 363, 19, 18, 358, 15, 20, 359]"

Mr. Gary Moore                                                                                                         For the Accused
[1]               Mr. Charron is charged with operating or with being in the care or control of a vehicle while impaired by alcohol on August 25, 2009, at Rocanville.
Count number two on the information - operating or being in care or control of a vehicle over .08 - was dismissed by me upon the defence application for a nonsuit.
[2]               During the testimony of Cst. Pshyk, the final Crown witness, an issue arose about whether the defence had been provided with full disclosure by the Crown.
In making this application, the defence asserts a breach of Mr. Charron’s right to make full answer and defence under s. 7 of the Charter as a result of a lack of full disclosure.
As a result, I view the appropriate remedy to be exclusion of the evidence which flowed from the breach of Mr. Charron’s right to make full answer and defence under s. 7.
[14]           Given my decision on the application under s. 24(1), there is no need to consider the s. 24(2) application.
As the Crown has completed its case, we will now proceed with the defence case, as Mr. Moore has indicated that defence intends to call evidence at this trial.
                                                                                                                                        R. Green, J","The accused was charged with impaired care or control.
The Court dismissed the charge of care or control over .08 after a non-suit application.
During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying.
During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech.
In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.
 The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence.
HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document.
The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown.
The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out.
While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence.
This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1).","[8, 10, 57, 0, 11, 58, 12, 56, 54, 14]"

CHARGES
ISSUES
FACTS
With respect to the right to counsel he read:
You may call any lawyer you wish.
Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the samples were not taken as soon as practicable.
 6)                   Was there ""evidence to the contrary""?
I have directed my mind to s. 258.(1)(c) & (d.1) of the Criminal Code.
This expert evidence however rests upon the testimony of the Accused which I have rejected.
As I have rejected the testimony of the Accused, I have no evidence which would tend to show that he was within the permitted limit and thus rebut the presumption.
Accordingly I find that there was no ""evidence to the contrary"".
The statutory presumption continues to apply.
CONCLUSION
3 S.C.R. 320 concerning reasonable doubt.
In light of my decision concerning issue a., I find the Accused not guilty of Count #2.
Count #1 was previously dismissed.
Dated at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan this 24th day of August, 2001.
S. P. Whelan, PCJ                                                         ","The accused was charged with impaired driving (Criminal Code ss.255(1) and 253(a)) and with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08 (Criminal Code ss.253(b) and 255(1)).
Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary?
HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08).
Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.
 1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed.
The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial.
4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case.
In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded.
It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence.
It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.
 5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings.
Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded.
6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test.
Both the subjective and objective tests were met.
The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test).
Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes.
However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence.
The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle.
While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied.
There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel.
He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver.
Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable.
It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city.
The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there.
It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant.
On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied.
There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected.
The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.","[658, 661, 656, 8, 4, 7, 653, 652, 0, 657, 1, 654, 9, 6, 3, 5, 649, 10, 646, 2, 11, 651, 645, 647, 14, 21, 13, 660, 23]"

[1]               Based on the events of December 5, 2009, at Carrot River, Ms. Neigel was charged with one count of impaired driving, and one count of driving “over .08”, as the charges are more formally particularized in the Information.
The defence has admitted all of the essential elements of each charge; the only issue is the factual one of whether or not Ms. Neigel was the person operating the vehicle.
The defence suggests that another individual, Mr. Wiens, was the driver, and that he had vacated the vehicle moments before the officers arrived.
THE FACTS:
[2]               The background is not in dispute.
4) keys were in fact in the vehicle, and it was running, as the police came to the driver’s side door; 
[31]           I find Ms. Neigel guilty on count 2, the “over .08”, as particularized in the Information.
I also find her guilty on count 1, the charge of impaired operation of a motor vehicle.
However, in order to avoid offending the rule against multiple convictions, I enter a judicial stay on count 1, to become final upon the expiration of all appeal periods.
                                                                                                                                     B. Morgan, J","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.
08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop.
The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time.
The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar.
The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up.
The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle.
The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle.
The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck.
HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count.
The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date.
The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability.
The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward.
The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door.
The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.","[0, 140, 11, 8, 138, 13, 12, 10, 137, 139, 134, 14]"

ANALYSIS
Did the investigating officer have reasonable grounds to make the Intoxilyzer demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code? 
Although the onus lies upon an accused to establish a Charter violation on a balance of probabilities, a demand for breath samples amounts to a warrantless search which is prima facie unreasonable.
As a result, the Crown must establish that the search was authorized by law, the law was reasonable and the search was conducted in a reasonable fashion.
In this case, there is no dispute that s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code authorizes the search and is reasonable.
No issue was taken with the authority of the officer to stop the vehicle driven by the accused.
Accordingly, an assessment based on this criteria, would also favour the admission of the evidence.
[30]           In balancing the three lines of evaluation directed in Grant, I would conclude that the admission of the certificate would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
The breach was not the result of a wilful or blatant disrespect of the Charter by the officer and was at the lower end of the spectrum of breaches.
M.L. Gray, J","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08.
He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused.
The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded.
The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk.
The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number.
He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane.
The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane.
The officer activated his emergency equipment.
The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle.
The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle.
The officer did not note smell of alcohol.
HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid.
While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told.
Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused.
In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol.
The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol.
The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality.
In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body.
The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds.
No charter breach was established.
The certificate was not excluded.","[66, 67, 165, 163, 65, 162, 68, 69, 161, 0, 8, 70]"

(2)  having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood he did operate a motor vehicle contrary to section 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.
ANALYSIS OF RIGHT TO COUNSEL ISSUE
[11]           Based on my findings of fact set out above, it is my conclusion that there was no breach of the accused’s right to counsel.
I believe that, if the accused had had control over dialling the phone, no different outcome would have occurred.
DESTRUCTION OF VIDEO EVIDENCE
The tape in question had been erased before the defence had requested disclosure.
ANALYSIS
[14]           If the videotape had been preserved, it would have provided a series of still shots, taken every four seconds, with no audio covering the period that the accused was in the hallway and the breathalyzer room, but not in the lawyer room.
I therefore find that the destroyed video evidence was of no relevance and could not have assisted the accused in making full answer and defence.
On the facts of this case, the accused’s rights were not breached by the destruction of the video evidence.
CONCLUSION
                                                                                                                                     J. Benison, J","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08.
The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer.
He did not receive a call back from his wife.
The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available.
The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid.
After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find.
The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.'
The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value.
The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call.
The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape.
The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio.
The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel.
HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter.
Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action.
There was no obligation on the part of the RCMP to provide the accused with a Prosper warning.
The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer.
The officer was justified in assuming that the accused was satisfied with the legal advice he had received.
The Crown stayed the impaired driving count prior to the conclusion of the trial.
The videotape evidence was not relevant to the .08 offence because all observations were made at roadside.
The video would not have shown anything of relevance to the charge.
There is no breach of the accused's rights under s. 7.
The Certificate of Analysis was admitted into evidence and the accused was convicted of the .08 charge.","[76, 73, 72, 8, 0, 62, 61, 57, 56, 13, 10, 71, 44, 7, 1, 63, 45]"

To come to this conclusion, without any interpretive testimony, was to commit an error in law.
These observations are applicable in this case and there was an error of law.
What the verdict would have been absent the trial judge’s consideration of the certificate is by no means clear.
Consequently, I am obliged to resolve the matter in favour of the accused, and the conviction is set aside.
As noted above, however, I am of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict so rather than direct an acquittal, it is appropriate to order a new trial.
Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held before a judge of the Provincial Court for Saskatchewan.
In any event, the Crown is alleging the existence of signs of impairment and the accused has offered an innocent explanation for them.
In those circumstances, the court should consider whether the evidence is sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that alcohol consumption was a contributing factor to the alleged signs of impairment.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code.
The accused was convicted of impaired driving.
An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge.
HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held.
1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions.
2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment.
What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear.
The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused.
As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","[80, 81, 0, 1, 2, 4, 3, 76, 77, 75, 78, 5, 74, 73]"

[2]         The following issues arose during the trial:
If the evidence of impairment establishes any degree of impairment ranging from slight to great, the offence has been made out.
Obviously this was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and also, its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.
As mentioned previously herein, I do not regard the evidence of the accused remaining asleep through the green lights to be a reliable indicator of impairment, given that the accused was immediately awakened when the officer grabbed him by the wrist.
As well, shortly thereafter, he appeared to fully comprehend the circumstances in which he was involved.
[22]       Therefore, one must consider the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot.
In the context of Stellato, in my view, the nature and quality of this evidence of impairment is so frail as to leave me with a reasonable doubt as to impairment.
Therefore, the accused is not guilty of the charge under s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code.
_______________________________, PCJ","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively.
Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt.
The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes.
HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges.
1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter.
The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means.
Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt.
2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand.
The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole.
Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances.
It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes.
The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents.
The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card.
The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking.
3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment.
The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","[125, 126, 0, 124, 123, 1, 121, 122, 120, 2, 3, 5, 118, 6, 9]"

                                                       The Defence Evidence
[7]                  The accused testified that he suffers from panic attacks and that, when stopped by the police, he was in the grip of such an attack.
He had no recollection of any difficulty in sitting on the chair in the phone booth at the detachment.
He said that it was possible that he was unsteady on his feet because “I was into my panic disorder”.  
                                                                     Analysis
            The defence argues that the police officers were focused on impairment by alcohol because they had been told by their dispatcher that the operator of the two-toned brown Ford pick-up might be drunk.
            Although the accused testified that he was into his panic attack his evidence was that he was working hard, stressed out about his marriage, stressed out about his mother and sister, off his medications, drinking, and not sleeping.
He testified that he was like a robot.
                                                                   Decision
            I do not believe the accused when he testified that he was in the throws of a panic attack.
DATED this 28th day of January, A.D., 2003, at the City of Prince Albert, in the Province of Saskatchewan.
                                                                                              S.C. Carter, Provincial Court Judge","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drug (Code ss.253(a) and 255(1)).
The accused admitted to consuming one vodka cooler before driving but argued the signs of impairment were manifestations of his panic attack.
No .08 charge was laid, as his readings were .07 and .06.
HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving.
The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack.
The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.
As stated in McCallum, the fact that the effects of alcohol may have been exacerbated by the accused suffering from fatigue does not provide a defence to the charge.","[147, 139, 3, 0, 138, 120, 5, 140, 119, 137, 118, 50, 121, 146, 51]"

J U D G M E N T - T.B. Bekolay, P.C.J.
John Field, CROWN PROSECUTOR, Prince Albert, Sask.  FOR THE CROWN.
Jonathon Stephen Abrametz stands charged that on or about the 16th day of December, 1998 at Prince Albert, in the Province of Saskatchewan, he:  
(1) - did while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug have the care or control of a motor vehicle contrary to Section 255(1) and Section 253(a) of the Criminal Code;
The crown referred the court to a number of them.
Counsel for the accused referred the court to R. v. Lott and R. v. Emke.
In the Lott decision the trial judge disbelieved that the police were checking for any of the specified objects and therefore it is of little relevance in this case where the officer was clearly checking the licencing relevant to vehicle insurance.
It is this court’s view that the R. v. Emke decision is outdated given more recent case law.
Having convicted him in relation to this count I enter a judicial stay in relation to the impaired driving count although,  if it were necessary,  I clearly would have found him guilty in respect to that count as well.
Dated this 4th day of August, A.D. 2000, in the City of Prince Albert, in the Province of Saskatchewan.
T.B. Bekolay, Provincial Court Judge","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1).
The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached.
In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop.
HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08.
A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary.
1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada.
When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated.
The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another.
Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation.
The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers.
2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles.
The R. v. Emke decision is outdated.
3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty.
There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","[0, 195, 193, 190, 2, 3, 5, 194, 1, 186, 4, 188, 189]"

December 12, 2001                                                      L.A MATSALLA, PCJ
1          The accused is charged that he did, on February 26, 2001 in Swift Current district, Saskatchewan, operate a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to section 38(1)(b) of The Highways and Transportation Act, 1997.
In essence, it is alleged that the accused operated an overweight vehicle on a road to which the Minister's weight restriction applied.
I can only conclude that the Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given.
24         Even if it could be said that sufficient notice was given, I cannot conclude that Ms. Melnychuk's endorsement upon the order that the order ""conforms to the original"" meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy ""under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the ... public document is placed"" (section 12 SEA) since I do not know if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in section 7(c) of SEA since her official capacity is not described.
25         At the end of the day, it has not been established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor had it been established that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.
Accordingly, it has not been proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused violated the provisions of section 38(1)(b) of HTA.
DATED at SWIFT CURRENT, Saskatchewan, this 12th day of December, A.D. 2001

No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer.
The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case.
HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b).
It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.
 1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied.
Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.
 2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given.
The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given.
The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public.
Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish.
3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described.
The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA).
It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","[0, 98, 1, 99, 95, 97, 96, 2, 94, 4, 3, 5, 7, 90, 6, 92]"

            In the case before me, the admissibility of the evidence is essential to the Crown’s case in count 1 in the indictment.
            Count 1 in the indictment is a serious offence.
            At pp. 126-27, Arbour J. stated:
At the end of the day, though, the constitutional question is whether the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into dispute (Collins, supra, at p. 281).

47: “The last stage of the R. v. Collins, supra, inquiry asks whether the vindication of the specific Charter violation through the exclusion of evidence extracts too great a toll on the truth seeking goal of the criminal trial.”
CONCLUSION","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and four other charges related to her attempts to evade arrest.
At the onset of her trial, the accused took the position that her s. 8, s. 9 and s. 10 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all the evidence obtained after the stop should be excluded.
HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached.
1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest.
2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there.
3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.","[1, 0, 290, 2, 7, 10, 4, 8, 287, 285, 289, 3, 5, 279, 280, 284, 6, 278, 276, 275]"

DECISION ON SECOND STAGE
November 16, 2012
BACKGROUND
[5]              The Crown has advised that Robert Lowenberger and Kelly Charbonneau have been informed that a disclosure order was made concerning their criminal histories.
The court has not received any submissions from these two individuals or any other parties in respect of the second stage of the O’Connor disclosure process or with regard to any conditions for release of any documents or the information they contain.
DECISION
The original packet of documents filed by the Crown will be retained by me until the trial is completed, including any possible appeals.
ORDER
It is hereby ordered that the 95 pages of documents are being released under the following conditions:
(e)         Any person who sees these documents is not to disclose their contents to anyone not entitled to inspect them.
(f)         Upon completion of the trial and after the time for any appeal has expired, the documents shall be returned to the clerk of this Court in a sealed envelope for delivery to me and to be destroyed.
OTHER ISSUES
G. A. Chicoine","The accused was charged with second degree murder and two counts of aggravated assault.
The accused made an O'Connor application for third party records relating to the two surviving Crown witnesses.
In particular, the accused sought disclosure of police reports, videotaped evidence, witness statements, warned statements regarding the multiple arrests and charges incurred by the victims and disclosure of their criminal records.
In 2012 SKQB 543, the Court ordered production of the records.
This decision deals with whether the documents should be produced to the accused.
HELD: The documents were disclosed to the accused.
The judge vetted the documents to black out words, phrases or numbers that have no probative value or where the privacy interest of the witness would have been unjustifiably affected.","[12, 72, 0, 75, 16, 71, 13, 1, 62, 11, 61, 41, 70, 2, 63, 17, 54, 40]"

E.B. Stephens, STEPHENS, ARNOT LAW OFFICE, Prince Albert, SK. FOR THE DEFENCE.
                The accused is charged with offences contrary to Sections 271(1) and 153 of the Criminal Code.
The sexual assault and touching allegations allegedly occurred between January 15, 1998 and March 31, 1999.  
Perhaps his behaviour drove her to lose her temper.
Perhaps her temper and dislike of the accused drove her to allege the behaviour against a person whom she said she did not like and who she did not want living at the house.
Although his explanations for touching and his evidence of the complainant’s behaviour are at odds with the Crown’s evidence, there is simply not enough confirmatory evidence surrounding the allegations for there to be proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
             The accused is, therefore, not guilty of either count on the Information.  
DATED this 20th day of December, A.D., 1999, at the City of Prince Albert, in the Province of Saskatchewan.

The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15.
HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts.
1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once.
His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish.
None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor.
The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.","[2, 159, 4, 157, 5, 158, 0, 6, 7, 10, 152, 8, 155, 9, 153]"
222,"_ This fiat is subject to an Order pursuant to s. 486(3) of the Criminal Code that there be no publication of the complainant's name or of any evidence that would identify the complainant in any media.
The accused was born on October 22, 1968 so that he ceased to be a ""young person"" within the meaning of the Young Offenders Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. Y-1, on the first date specified in the indictment.
Jurisdiction          As I do not have jurisdiction over any sexual assaults committed by the accused while he was a young person, the Crown quite properly declined to ask for an amendment of the dates specified in the indictment to conform to the evidence.
Although I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused sexually assaulted the complainant between the dates of February 5, 1985 to February 4, 1986, I am not satisfied that he did so as charged after he become an adult on the 22nd day of October, 1986.
One or two of the incidents of touching might have occurred after this October 22, 1986 date, but such a finding would be based more on conjecture than on proven fact.          The accused is acquitted of the charge in the indictment.                      _______________________________________ J.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and was tried in the Court of Queen's Bench.

HELD: Accused acquitted.

The Nature of the Case
[1]                  The accused is charged with sexual assault pursuant to s. 271 of the Criminal Code.
This is the second case that I have heard this year that involves gross intoxication on the part of not only the accused but the complainant as well.
Although she had the right to get drunk and pass out, her conduct is no more responsible than that of a person who exercises his right to walk along a highway at night in dark clothing.
These last two cases dealt only with automatism that did not arise from self-induced intoxication but they define the states and different kinds of automatism.
            In my view, the case before me is one of those rare cases in which the accused has established the Daviault “extreme intoxication” defence on a balance of probabilities.
Were it not for s. 33.1 that does away with this defence in sexual assault cases, I would have acquitted him.
Conclusion
            The accused is guilty as charged.
I invite sentencing submissions from counsel.","The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code.
Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication.
Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent.
HELD: The accused was found guilty.
 1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities.
He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.
 2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent.
The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent.
The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief.
It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out.
She was incapable of giving consent after that time.
Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence.
It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality.
His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others.
The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society.
Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society.
The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness.
Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent.
The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","[208, 209, 206, 205, 1, 0, 204, 2, 207, 6, 10, 4, 3, 7, 9, 201, 12]"

 [19]                                  In the present case there was no evidence tying the accused to the gym bag.
It was of a different description than the one used in the Nordon robbery.
The accused has never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it.
 [20]                                  I note also that the gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence, another factor which I must bear in mind in light of the suggestion that the evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter.
 [21]                                  If there were any violations of the accused's rights under the Charter, and I have concluded there were not, they were of a minor nature and certainly not sufficiently egregious to engage the provisions of s. 24(2) of the Charter.
To exclude the evidence in question would, in fact, bring the administration of justice into manifest disrepute.
 [22]                                  The actions of the police were not unlawful with respect to either the arrest or search and seizure.","The accused was charged with ten counts including robbery, aggravated assault, assault causing bodily harm, possession of stolen property and trafficking in narcotics.
She raised s.9 and 8 of the Charter in objecting to the arrest and seizure of the duffel bag.
The voir dire occupied 5 days.
HELD: 1)The four requirements set out in R. v. Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied.
The arrest was lawful.
The search of the house and seizure of the duffel bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful.
2)The accused had no expectation of privacy with respect to either her friend's residence or the bag.
The decision in R. v. Edwards was squarely on point.
There was no evidence tying the accused to the gym bag.
It was of a different description than the one used in the drugstore robbery.
The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it.
The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence.
3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter.
To exclude the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","[116, 0, 115, 1, 112, 2, 3, 4, 110, 111, 114, 5, 113, 7]"

[1]               The accused, Lorry Richard Smith (""Smith""), is charged:
Random stop programs must not be turned into a means of conducting either an unfounded general inquisition or an unreasonable search.
Further, at p. 625:
The police questions pertaining to the appellant's gym bag, the search of the bag and of the appellant's vehicle were all elements of a search.
Furthermore, that search was made without the requisite foundation of reasonable and probable grounds.
It was therefore an unreasonable search in contravention of s. 8 of the Charter.
         Counsel argues the search was unreasonable as it was not authorized by law.
It is said the search itself began when Cst. McLaughlin without any legal authority turned the roadside encounter into a general inquisition to satisfy his curiosity as to what was in the back of the van.
                                     S. 24(2) OF THE CHARTER
         Section 24 of the Charter provides:
Mr. Smith would have driven on and there is no basis to conclude the evidence would likely have been discovered by other means.
         Having concluded that the evidence ought to be excluded on the basis that its admission would render the trial unfair, it is unnecessary to consider the other two factors.","The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act.
The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police.
A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road.
The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance.
The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists.
The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself.
The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC.
He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine.
The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act.
The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches.
HELD: The evidence is excluded.
The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance.
The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime.
When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got.
The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question.
The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement.
The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation.
The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get.
The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van.
The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law.
The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated.
The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van.
The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.
The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","[388, 354, 178, 176, 0, 179, 387, 355, 175, 1, 174, 3, 2, 7, 173, 4, 9, 172]"

[17]           Mr. Rookes also testified that he verified with a Saskatchewan Government Insurance publication entitled Motor Cycle Handbook, that operators of electric assist cycles are not  required to have driver’s licences.
THE LAW 
Everyone commits an offence who, without reasonable excuse, fails or refuses to comply with a demand made under this section.
ANALYSIS
As in any criminal trial, the prosecution bears the burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The Crown must prove each essential element of the offence charged beyond a reasonable doubt. Mr. Rookes is presumed innocent and bears no burden to prove anything.
After considering the whole of the evidence, if there is a reasonable doubt on any element of the offence, he must be found not guilty.
As a result I am of the view that the Crown has failed to prove that Mr. Rookes was operating  a motor vehicle on the evening of February 26, 2010.
Hence, I acquit him of the charges of operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drug and refusing to provide a breath sample.
CONCLUSION
M.J. Hinds, J","The accused was charged with two counts being driving while impaired contrary to s. 253(1)(a) and refusal to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code.
The Court had earlier acquitted the accused on the charge of driving while disqualified as there was no evidence regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence.
At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code.
The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it.
HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court.
There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.","[146, 144, 0, 8, 143, 114, 142, 113, 115, 1, 116, 98, 93, 7]"

R. v. Calvin John Klimek
S. 264.1 Criminal Code
Decision
The bare words “I should drown you” won’t ordinarily attract criminal liability.
However, all of the surrounding circumstances will bear on whether the words are innocently spoken, or whether there is something in all the circumstances which would convey to a reasonable person the menace  that harm or ill will befall you.
In my view the words spoken by the Accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously, and implied menace to the listeners They cannot on any reasonable construction of their meaning lead a reasonable person to doubt that they conveyed a threat.
Decision
As indicated, I disbelieve the Accused’s evidence.
I do not consider it reasonably capable of being true.
In my opinion, the Accused, in a much cooler frame of mind than on the day of the incident, has constructed a story in explanation of what occurred.
The story does not “hang together”, for the reasons I have given.
Considering all of the evidence, I find that the Crown has proven its case against Calvin Klimek beyond a reasonable doubt, and I accordingly find him guilty of the charge as amended.
Dated at Melfort, Saskatchewan on April 18, 2000.","The accused was charged with uttering threats to his 77 year old mother to cause death to her and his brothers contrary to s.264.1 of the Criminal Code.
HELD: The accused was found guilty.
1)The words spoken by the accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously and implied menace to the listeners.
The accused's evidence was disbelieved.
His constructed story did not 'hang together'.
 2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value.
The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences.
Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility.
The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference.","[0, 4, 9, 11, 13, 209, 211, 210, 14, 212, 207, 206, 208, 15, 17, 16, 203, 18, 204, 205]"

HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody.
The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain.
The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province.
The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","[11, 153, 152, 151, 12, 150, 13, 149, 16, 148, 18, 19, 147, 146]"

[12]2008 BCCA 8 (CanLII).","The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon.
He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation.
He appeals both conviction and sentence.
The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment.
The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex.
The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'.
Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face.
As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat.
The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies.
HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed.
The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court.
While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case.
There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial.
Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence.
The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case.
Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted.
The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels.
Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment.
After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada.
If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order.
The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","[166, 164, 0, 165, 163, 3, 162, 2, 159, 1, 4, 161, 160, 6, 8, 5, 7, 157, 158, 12, 154, 13, 155, 9, 10, 11, 153, 151, 16, 15, 152]"

The sentence was sixty days consecutive as an adult sentence.
Convicted of aggravated assault (s. 328(1)), two counts of breach of conditions.
This conviction is the predicate offence and the circumstances are set out in my judgment of November 9, 2010.

The Evidence from the Sentencing Hearing
The Evidence of Dr. Roger Holden 
          Dr. Holden was qualified to give opinion evidence with regard to the assessment and treatment of violent offenders including the assessment of risk.
Dr. Holden is a forensic psychologist with over thirty years experience working with violent offenders.
He is entitled to a one for one credit for remand time for a credit of twenty-six months.
I therefore sentence the accused as follows:
a)        To forty-six months in a federal penitentiary;
e)        There will be an order given the length of sentence that the victim surcharge be waived.
                                                                                                                            R. D. MAHER","The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section.
The Crown brought a dangerous offender application.
The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing.
His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions.
The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang.
The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy.
The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang.
He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation.
The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth.
The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary.
While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody.
The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated.
HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code.
The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang.
The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i).
Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently.
The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii).
The accused was declared a dangerous offender.
However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public.
In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated.
The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","[279, 278, 1, 2, 0, 276, 280, 274, 3, 578, 275, 273, 572, 281, 282, 271, 4, 8, 6, 5, 10, 573, 7, 268, 571, 577]"

After a trial before a judge of the Provincial Court, he was convicted of the charge.
He now appeals.      Besides the complainant and the accused, another person was present at the time of the incident out of which the charge arose.
The       trial judge has the advantage, denied to the appellate       court, of seeing and hearing the evidence of witnesses.       However, as a matter of law it remains open to an       appellate court to overturn a verdict based on findings       of credibility where, after considering all the evidence       and having due regard to the advantages afforded to the       trial judge, it concluded that the verdict is       unreasonable.       Great deference to findings of credibility made at trial should be shown.
Upon a consideration of all the evidence in the transcript thereof, and ""having due regard to the advantages afforded to the trial judge"", it cannot be said his findings are not supported by the evidence, nor can it be said his conclusions are clearly wrong so as to make the conviction unreasonable.
See:  R. v. Andres 1979 CanLII 2238 (SK CA), [1982]
In the result, the appeal against the conviction is dismissed, and accordingly affirmed.                                                  GEATROS J.","The accused was convicted of assault.
He contends that the trial judge so concerned himself with the question of credibility of the complainant and the accused that he overlooked his duty to consider evidence of a witness, 'together with the rest of the evidence, with a view to determining whether it raised a reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt, irrespective of whether he believed the evidence of the complainant.'
HELD: Appeal dismissed and conviction accordingly affirmed.
 1)Great deference to findings of credibility made at trial should be shown.
2)The trial judge did not say that he found the accused guilty only upon the credibility of the complainant and the accused.
He said that he found the Crown's evidence to be credible, and the accused's evidence not to be credible.
The Crown's evidence was comprised of both the complainant and the witness.
3)The trial judge's findings are supported by the evidence and his conclusions are not clearly wrong so as to make the conviction unreasonable.","[14, 13, 1, 0, 12, 2, 11]"
232,"It follows that if J.R.S. is found to be neither a dangerous offender nor a long-term offender, Part XXIV of the Criminal Code does not apply.
The sentencing principles articulated in Part XXIII govern the sentences to be imposed for J.R.S.’s convictions, including those set out in s. 718.2(e).

The Crown submits that it has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that J.R.S. constitutes a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons.
It submits that it has established a pattern of behaviour described in both s. 753(a) (i) and (ii) of the Criminal Code.  Section 753(1)(a) states:
The Crown is only required to prove the pattern of behaviour as defined by s. 753(a)(i) or (ii), it does not have to prove both.
The pattern does not depend upon the number of offences but on the repetitive nature of the offender’s behaviour.
11 W.W.R. 649 at para.
111, the repetitive behaviour can be established on two different bases: 
The letter (Exhibit P-12) dated June 13, 2005, written by the accused states:
A determinate sentence followed by a long term supervision is not appropriate.
As to the remaining eight charges (the six guilty pleas and two convictions), J.R.S. is sentenced to time served.
                                                                                                A. R. ROTHERY","The accused was convicted of common assault, break and enter and commit assault and assault causing bodily harm and his former common law spouse was the complainant in each instance.
The accused also entered guilty pleas to three charges stemming from breaches of no-contact conditions with the same complainant plus two charges of obstruction of justice by attempting to dissuade the same complainant from giving evidence.
The RCMP had to execute a Feeney warrant to locate the complainant in the accused basement.
The Crown sought an order declaring the accused a dangerous offender.
HELD: The accused was designated a dangerous offender and was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period on the conviction pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and received time served on the remaining eight charges.
The evidence is conclusive that the offence for which the accused was convicted was a serious personal injury offence.
The evidence was conclusive that the accused constitutes a threat to other persons because of his pattern of repetitive behaviour and persistent aggressive behaviour.
The accused's First Nation would provide support for the accused but its support system is presently non-existent.
The Court rejected the expert opinions recommending a long term offender order as being appropriate.","[830, 168, 122, 160, 834, 161, 123, 837, 171, 167, 172, 823, 162]"

Nothing in the Criminal Code suggests the lifetime duration of the order rests on the offender being sentenced separately for each offence.
The latter section speaks directly to the circumstances where an offender has been previously convicted of a designated offence:
(3)        Order – if previous offence established – When a court imposes a sentence on a person for a designated offence in connection with which an order may be made under subsection (1) or (2) or renders a verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder for such an offence, it shall, on application of the prosecutor, make an order in Form 52 requiring the person to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for the applicable period specified in section 490.013 if the prosecutor establishes that
[7]        Put simply, if Parliament had intended the narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1) rendered by the sentencing judge’s interpretation of it, Parliament would have used the same language in s. 490.013(2.1) as it did in s. 490.012(3).
Therefore, in our view, Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who commits multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or all together.","The accused was convicted of four counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code.
The Crown had proceeded by indictment and the accused was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 8 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year Sexual Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) compliance order.
At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order.
If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3).
Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who committed multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or altogether.","[0, 40, 1, 2, 3, 36, 39, 4, 5, 34, 6, 37]"

TILAK R. MALHOTRA
RESPONDENT
As noted, Swan saw the respondent driving his car in the wrong lane of traffic at, what he testified to be, relatively high speed.
This was accepted among the indications of impairment of the respondent by the trial judge.
Given these failures in analysis, it is not necessary for us to deal with an argument now presented by the Crown that the appellate court judge also erred with respect to the nature of the charge when she focussed on post-driving conduct when the charge was care and control.
On the analysis above alone, the verdict of the appellate court judge must be set aside.
We are of the view that on the appropriately posed question, was there sufficient evidence on which a properly instructed jury could have convicted on the charge here, the answer is unequivocally yes.
There was probative evidence on each material point of the charge, it was carefully analyzed by the Provincial Court judge and his acceptance of critical points on each essential of the charge is set out in his judgment.
For these reasons, the appeal must be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Queen’s Bench is set aside and the judgment of the Provincial Court is restored.","The accused was convicted of having care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired (Criminal Code s.253(a)) but acquitted on the charge under s.253(b).
The Provincial Court trial judge did not accept the accused's testimony that his blood-alcohol concentration was between .068 and .081 at the time of driving.
On appeal the Queen's Bench judge set aside the conviction and ordered an acquittal.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The Queen's Bench judgment was set aside and the Provincial Court trial judgment was restored.
While the appellate judge stated the correct standard of review, he did not in fact apply it and made inaccurate assessments of the evidence and conclusion of the trial judge.","[1, 2, 69, 68, 4, 66, 67, 3, 64, 5, 6, 63, 7, 65]"

Introduction
[1]               Graham Gunningham is charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.
The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene.
Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample and a “fail” reading was obtained.
The accused was arrested, his rights were read to him and a breathalyzer demand was made.
He ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel.
[60]           In the circumstances, I find there was no breach of s. 10(b) of the Charter.
[61]           I have found that the ASD demand was not made forthwith, giving rise to a breach of the accused’s ss. 8 and 9 Charter rights.
However, based upon Grant, I have determined that the Certificate of Analyses ought to be admitted into evidence.
I have found no breach of the accused’s s. 10(b) right to counsel at roadside or at the police station.
[62]           For the foregoing reasons, the Certificate of Analyses will be admitted into evidence on the trial proper.
D.C. Scott, J","The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident.
The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m.
Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m.
The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel.
The accused was charged with driving over .08.
The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained.
The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis.
HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed.
While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made.
2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged.
The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised.
The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","[264, 263, 0, 265, 261, 13, 10, 16, 8, 259, 18, 262, 15, 11]"

(a)        is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years and to a minium punishment of imprisonment for a term of forty-five days; ...
                            CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCE
His sexual touching occurred at his residence on the Muscowpetung First Nation Reserve on occasions when A.M. would visit with him and her mother on weekends.
Mitigating Circumstances
Time will tell.
                                              CONCLUSION
This is not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate.
[40]           In addition, the court imposes the following optional conditions in this probation order:
That S.C. will report to a probation officer within five working days after the making of this probation order and thereafter when required by the probation officer and in the manner directed by the probation officer;
That S.C. shall participate actively in assessments, education and/or treatment in an approved program or programs for substance abuse and sex offenders as may be directed by and to the satisfaction of S.C.’s probation officer and, if so directed, S.C. shall not give just cause for dismissal from such program.
That S.C. shall refrain from having any contact with A.M. during the period of his incarceration and, subsequently, this probation order.
                                                                                              T. C. Zarzeczny","The accused was found guilty of the following offence: for a sexual purpose touching A. M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code.
After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate.
The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions.
HELD: The accused is sentenced to 9 months incarceration.
Pursuant to s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code, a firearm order was made for 10 years prohibiting the accused from possessing any type of weapon.
The accused shall also supply a sample of his DNA for analysis.
There is an order under s. 490.012(1) that the accused comply with the Sexual Offender Information Registration Act.
The accused is also prohibited, pursuant to an order under s. 161(1)(a), from attending a public park or swimming area where persons under the age of 14 years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, day care centre, school ground, playground or community centre for a period of 3 years.","[9, 0, 15, 148, 125, 159, 147, 10, 16, 149, 126, 112, 124, 150, 23]"

The Crown appeals both conclusions and asks this court to set aside the acquittal and order a new trial.
                                                 ANALYSIS
[7]            The law on approved roadside screening devices has been summarized by Durno R.S.J. in R. v. Mastromartino, 2004 CanLII 28770 (ON SC), [2004]
This decision deals with two Crown appeals and two defence appeals relating to four separate individuals each of whom registered a fail result from an ASD test performed within 15 minutes of each having left a tavern.
Common to each of the appeals was the issue of whether the officer was required to delay obtaining an ASD sample due to concerns about residual mouth alcohol.
At paragraph 23 the court states:
In summary, I take Bernshaw and Einarson to establish the following:
I simply note that in arriving at this conclusion, the trial judge failed to articulate the analysis required for such a finding.
(See: R. v. Janzen, 2006 SKCA 111 (CanLII) at paragraph 7)
[18]           Based on the foregoing, the appeal is allowed and the acquittal set aside.
Given his conclusion on the voir dire, the trial judge did not assess that evidence.
A new trial must therefore be held and is so ordered.
                                                                                              J.L.G. Pritchard","The accused was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08.
The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated.
The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand.
HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test.
A new trial is ordered.
 1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test.
In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene.
Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2)
The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3)
The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'.
Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame.
Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","[0, 55, 162, 163, 164, 16, 59, 160, 159, 1, 58, 60, 158, 57, 56]"

(a)               This matter came before me pursuant to s. 672.23 of the Criminal Code, to determine the issue of the accused’s fitness to be tried for various offences.
It seems that Mr. Morrissey, with intact mental faculties but a hole in his memory, would fail to meet the test as annunciated by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Jobb and would accordingly be found not fit to stand trial.
On the other hand it appears that RCMc, with a memory but virtually no ability to participate in the court proceeding in any meaningful way, meets the limited cognitive capacity test as enunciated in Jobb.  
[34]           As RCMc meets the limited cognitive capacity test for the three branches of the test, I find him fit to stand trial.
[35]           The matter before me is simply a fitness hearing:  it is not a trial as such.
Defences and Charter issues which might be put forward at trial thus do not arise.

2008 SKCA 156 (CanLII), 314 Sask. R. 236 [2009]","The accused was subject to a hearing to determine whether he was fit to stand trial on charges under the Criminal Code.
The accused was grossly lacking in mental abilities, had limited and basic comprehension, had the mental capacity of a young child and these facts were not likely to change anytime soon.
The accused had extreme difficulty paying attention to the court proceedings and appeared incapable of doing so.
He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD:
The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability.
The accused said that his lawyer was the judge, could not answer when asked what the judge's role was and he had limited insight into why he was in Court.
The accused met the portion of the limited cognitive capacity test which requires an understanding of the nature of the proceedings and their possible consequences and the accused is capable of communicating his version of the events surrounding the allegations, but there is no possibility he could participate in a meaningful way in the trial.
According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence.
The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding.","[148, 1, 146, 2, 145, 144, 3, 141, 143, 4, 140, 5, 6, 9, 7, 139, 11, 138, 8, 12, 137]"

At the close of the trial the Crown and defence evidence was applied over to and became the evidence on information 24417999.
IV.      DEFENCE EVIDENCE
a)         Aimee Lynn Dagenais 
[19]           The defence also filed a report from Dr.  N.  DeBeer who examined Mayer later in the day on April 4, 2010.
The report notes “no other injuries except as described above”.
V.        ANALYSIS
Whether the physical altercation in this case was precipitated by jealousy or by a drug deal gone bad, there is no doubt that Mayer was the aggressor throughout.
He smashed in one, if not two, car windows.
Graham and Corfmat confirmed this in their testimony.
Mayer and Dagenais had been drinking that evening.
There is no evidence that McIntyre and Graham were under the influence of any substance, and for that reason I accept their testimony as to the involvement of Dagenais in the altercation.
VI.      DECISION
[25]           I find both the accused guilty of assault upon McIntyre contrary to s.  266 of the Criminal Code.  Mayer was clearly the main aggressor.
[27]           Dated at the City of Prince Albert, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 8th day of November, 2010.
S. C. Carter, J","The accused were both charged with assault contrary to s. 266.
The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.'
HELD: The accused were convicted of assault.
Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout.
He smashed one, if not two, car windows.
The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize.
The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code. 
While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault.
The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","[0, 160, 8, 169, 137, 159, 1, 7, 158, 87, 136, 138, 157, 168, 161, 88, 17, 139, 134]"
240,"In this instance, the Crown argues that incarceration should result, somewhere within that range and that under the circumstances of this offence a conditional sentence would not be appropriate.          The defence suggests a range of sentences which is broad, and lower than that suggested by the Crown.
Specifically the defence argues that a sentence in the lower end of the range is one which should be imposed and that such a sentence should be a conditional sentence to be served in the community, rather than in a corrections facility.
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCE          This accident occurred at approximately 10:30 p.m. on Sunday, July 21, 1996 at the intersection of Albert Street and 3rd Avenue North in the City of Regina.
At that intersection, there are two through driving lanes proceeding in a northerly direction, with a left turn lane and a right curb lane.
The intersection is not controlled by traffic lights.
The accused was driving a black 1986 Volkswagen model G.T.I. and had been travelling along Albert Street from the south side of Regina in a northerly direction.
While doing so, the accused shall comply with the following conditions of probation:   (1)
He shall keep the peace and be of good behavior.   (3)
He shall appear before the court whenever required         to do so.   (4)","The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community.
Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself.
Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian.
The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other.
HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed.
Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre.
An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course.
He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.
 1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death.
It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death.
Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences.
2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident.
Alcohol was not involved.
He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately.
Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered.
3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences.
The accused had six speeding convictions.
He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","[3, 6, 149, 2, 146, 1, 148, 5, 4]"

P. S. KOLENICK PCJ                             JUDGMENT
[1]               The accused youth is charged that on April 27, 2002, near Dundurn Saskatchewan, he did  operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug, contrary to Section 253(a) of the Criminal Code. 
[2]               The issue which arose herein was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.
Every situation in that respect will depend on its own circumstances, and obviously the particular tolerance to the same amount of alcohol consumption will vary from one individual to the next.
Further, the accused did not dispute the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results, and as such, he must be presumed to have consumed sufficient alcohol at some point to have achieved same.
However, regardless of that alcohol consumption, and the accused’s blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.
Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused has offered a reasonable explanation for them.
As a result, the evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment, and the accused must be acquitted.
Therefore, he is not guilty of impaired operation, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code.

The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.
HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.
Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them.
The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted.
1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes.
His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane.
The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period.
The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2)
The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking.
Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes.
3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4)
The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5)
The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner.
If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment.
The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations.
He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour.
In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them.
6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions.
However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.","[171, 170, 169, 5, 167, 6, 9, 168, 8, 7, 11, 166, 10, 165]"

Lane, Jackson and Smith JJ.A.
Aaron Fox, Q.C. for the Respondent
The trial judge accepted Cst. Lariviere’s statement that the finger incident occurred twice, which formed the basis for him to find that the instruction to leave the yard also occurred twice.
He noted that Cst. Hoffman “at no time felt endangered, and at no time took any steps such [as] pulling out his baton to deal with a dangerous or threatening situation” (at para. 11).
This is not an unreasonable conclusion.
Capturing all of the nuances of a trial in written reasons is a difficult task.
The trial judge in this case determined what happened on the whole of the evidence based on what he found to be the connections between the evidence of the three witnesses.
An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply on the basis that the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.
Conclusion
We grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal.
In the result, the conviction is restored.","The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a).
The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered.
The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial.
The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review.
HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored.
The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent.
The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning.
While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so.
The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate.
The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another.
An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","[144, 143, 0, 3, 142, 140, 1, 2, 139, 4, 6, 141, 138, 5, 7, 137, 9, 134]"

       The Honourable Mr. Justice Cameron
       The Honourable Mr. Justice Lane
His record includes one count of sexual assault, five counts of theft or possession of stolen property and four counts of failure to comply or to appear.
All offences committed after the first set of charges have also been in breach of probation.
B.D.L. turned 18 on October 13, 1994.  
       We are all of the view, having regard for the age of the offender, his previous record and the nature of the offences committed, notably the escape custody and dangerous driving, that a five month secure custody disposition, concurrent to an existing disposition, was not fit.
In arriving at this conclusion we have considered our decisions in R. v. Shane B. (unreported, issued December 6, 1994, court file nos. 6436, 6411, 6372 and 6427) and R. v. M.(J.C.) (unreported, issued December 6, 1994, court file no. 6451).
Accordingly, the disposition of five months is set aside and one year secure custody, again concurrent to the nine month open custody sentence, substituted.
We note B.D.L. has made some progress in secure custody, but, given its recent nature, it is better tested in a review process at a later date than by us at this time.","The accused, a young offender, was convicted of escaping lawful custody, theft of property valued in excess $1,000.00, dangerous driving and being in possession of stolen property.
A Provincial Court Judge sentenced him to 5 months closed custody concurrent with a sentence of 9 months open custody which he was serving at the time of his escape.
The Crown appealed.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
1)The accused had a lengthy record as a young offender and turned 18 two days after the commission of the last of the offences for which he was being sentenced.
2)The Court substituted a sentence of 12 months closed custody, concurrent with the 9 months open custody which he was already serving.","[0, 35, 1, 34, 2, 3, 4, 31, 5, 30, 32, 6, 29, 33]"

[1]               The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. (referred to as “Chisum”) and Garry Varga (referred to as “Varga”) are charged as follows:
Information 37262946: Count 1: between the 7th day of August, 2007 and the 8th day of September, 2007, did operate a processing facility without a licence, contrary to section 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1.

See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371 (CanLII).
Driedger on the Construction of Statutes, Ruth Sullivan, Third Edition, Butterworths Canada Ltd. 1994, Toronto, and Vancouver, pages 85 and 86.
Ibid, page 69.","The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act.
The accused corporation assembles log home packages.
The packages are sold to customers across Canada.
The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages.
L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused.
These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences.
In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused.
The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold.
The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence.
The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence.
HELD: 1)
The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'.
Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation.
See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371.
2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market.
Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.
 3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition.
Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4)
The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry.
The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands.
The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence.
5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","[9, 11, 170, 168, 0, 169, 166, 12, 14, 167, 165, 15, 164, 17, 163, 162, 16, 13]"

There is virtually no chance that the accused will ever commit another criminal offence;
10.A lengthy sentence will seriously affect the accused's ability to rehabilitate.
Taking all of the factors of sentencing into account, it is the sentence of this Court that you serve a term of 18 months in a provincial correctional centre.
Having imposed a custodial sentence of less than two years, I must now deal with s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code which permits the court to allow the accused to serve his term in the community.
This section has just recently come into force.
I am not aware of any judicial cases applying this section in sexual assault cases.
I am left with no alternative.
Therefore, the sentence must be served in a provincial correctional centre.
In addition, pursuant to the mandatory terms of s. 100 of the Criminal Code, the accused is prohibited from having any fire arms, ammunition or explosive substances for a period of ten years from his release from prison.","The accused, convicted of sexual assault, requested a non-custodial sentence pursuant to s742.1 of the Criminal Code.
HELD: The accused was sentenced to 18 months in a provincial correctional institution.
1)It would be contrary to the administration of justice in view of the seriousness of the offence to allow the accused to serve his sentence within the community even though he appeared to satisfy the requirements of s.742.1(a) and (b) of the Code.
There were numerous adverse impacts on the victim.
2)Mitigating circumstances included the absence of a criminal record; his abstinence from alcohol since the assault; the absence of penile penetration; his remorse and apology to the victim and to the court; his serious health problems; his ability to rehabilitate and the fact that he was a model citizen prior to the assault.","[75, 0, 76, 1, 74, 72, 2, 3, 71, 4, 6, 5, 70, 69, 68, 7, 67]"

[1]               In this case evidence was led on the trial proper and on a voir dire pursuant to an application under s. 24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence allegedly because of a breach of the Accused’s rights under the Charter.
The primary defence of the Accused is one of identity.
I will deal with that first.
[2]               I have had an opportunity to review the transcript of evidence and the argument of counsel and would like to thank both counsel for your informative and helpful briefs.
I have also reviewed all of the evidence in order to determine whether the Crown has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt whether the Accused was the operator of the motor vehicle at the requisite time.
[3]               The police got involved with the Accused as a result of a complaint of Ms. Anna Krakowetz.
They were used to identify the Accused’s vehicle and the Accused as a possible driver of that vehicle.
[36]           However, the exclusion of that evidence of the fob and keys further weakens the circumstantial case against the Accused to the extent that the Crown has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.
[37]           As a result the Accused is found not guilty of both charges before me.

The police arrested the accused and found a fob that operated the locks on the doors of the vehicle and the engine hood of the accused's vehicle was warm.
The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving.
HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges.
The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous.
The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.","[150, 11, 8, 10, 14, 0, 12, 151, 146, 13, 16, 149]"

James A. Johnson for the Appellant
Accordingly, hearsay matters in the father’s affidavits should not have been considered.
As to the reports prepared by Karin McEwen and Francis Stewart, neither were sworn or verified under oath.
Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered.
Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even direction of the trial of an issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.
But even if the hearsay were admissible, given the direct denial under oath by the mother of either alcoholism or lack of proper care for the child, there should have been an order directing trial of an issue rather than a decision made on the written evidence filed:  Zaba v. Bradley (1996), 1996 CanLII 4930 (SK CA), 137 Sask. R. 295 (C.A.).
Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order below is set aside.
The father shall have leave to reapply on proper evidence if so advised.","The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago.
During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday.
HELD: Appeal allowed orally.
 1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision.
2) The appeal must succeed.
Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree.
The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case.
It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3)
It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case.
The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall.
One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her.
4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered.
The report were not sworn or verified under oath.
 Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered.
Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","[82, 0, 81, 1, 3, 79, 2, 78, 76, 77, 4, 80, 6, 5, 7, 8]"

Except as otherwise provided in this Act or the regulations, the terms used in this Act have the meanings given to them in The Land Titles Act, 2000.
In addition, s. 2(1)(e) provides:
(e) “condominium title”, with respect to the condominium unit for which the title has issued, means the right to:
(i) an ownership share in the condominium unit; and
(ii) a share in the common property;
The relevant provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000, with respect to the registration of an interest, are these:
In this Act:
(s) “interest” means any right, interest or estate, whether legal or equitable, in, over or under land recognized at law that is less than title;
(t) “interest holder” means a person who is registered in the land titles registry as a holder of an interest;
2(1)(h) “common property” means the part of the land and buildings included in a condominium plan that is not included in any unit shown in the condominium plan;
Common property

R.R.S., c. C-26.1, Reg. 2 (effective June 25, 2001).","The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer.
The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into.
In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant.
The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land.
The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages.
The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest.
The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000.
The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
 1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2)
The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property.
The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'.
Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect.
3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","[102, 149, 101, 0, 129, 100, 99, 3, 1, 98, 2, 97, 96, 148, 4, 7, 130, 6, 95, 5, 8, 93]"

Cameron, Gerwing & Sherstobitoff JJ.A.
Jennifer D. Pereira for the Appellant
In light of the view we take of the matter, it is not necessary for us to decide whether Mr Yaganiski’s conduct amounted to a breach of contract, although on balance we incline to the opinion it did.
Assuming it did (which is to put the case for the appellant at its highest), Belterra has not satisfied us that it suffered any loss attributable to the breach.
We are not satisfied of this, having regard for the following facts: (i) effective July 1, 2000, Mato Corporation independently terminated its distributorship agreement with Belterra, meaning Belterra could no longer obtain Mato products for sale to its customers: (ii) in the ensuing year  Belterra was able to sell existing inventory of Mato products to its customers at a profit, which in fact it did: (iii) there is no evidence establishing that Belterra was unable to sell all of its existing inventory to its existing customers during the year, and no evidence that it was unable to do so by reason of anything the respondent did or might have done in breach of his contract with Belterra.
Belterra’s loss, so to speak, consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit.
But this loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did.
As the trial judge found, the termination of the distributorship was unconnected to the respondent.
Hence, we have decided to dismiss the appeal.
The appeal is dismissed with costs, such costs to be taxed as usual on the basis of double column 5 of the Court of Appeal Tariff of costs.","The appellant appeal arguing that the respondent's conduct in soliciting the customers of the appellant constituted a breach of contract.
HELD: Appeal dismissed orally.
Even if the respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, the appellant failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach.
The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit.
This loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did.
As the trial judge found, the termination of the distributorship was unconnected to the respondent.","[0, 26, 25, 1, 2, 24, 3, 23, 4, 5, 22, 6, 20, 7, 8, 19, 21]"

Nevertheless, he notes that at page 99 of the transcript the learned trial judge stated as follows:
He obviously enjoys a good reputation in the community else the chief of his First Nation would not be writing a letter of support for him.
 [23]                                  The prohibition from driving for 18 months imposed by the Court is consistent with the prohibition generally imposed where conduct constituting dangerous driving has resulted in bodily injury or death or, at the very least, serious property damage.
Although the accused was convicted for refusal to provide a breath sample two years prior to his conviction for dangerous driving, alcohol was not a factor in this matter.
Crown counsel acknowledges that in circumstances of the kind before the Court, one would anticipate a driving prohibition of less than the 18 months imposed.
 [24]                                  In my opinion, a prohibition of 18 months was excessive.
In the circumstances a prohibition of nine months' duration is more appropriate and I so order.
The fine of $1,200 and surcharge of $180 imposed by the trial judge is confirmed.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving (Criminal Code s.249(1)(a)) and sentence of a $1,200 fine, $180 surcharge, and 18 month driving prohibition.
In issue was whether the evidence found by the trial judge established both the mens rea and actus reus beyond a reasonable doubt.
The sentence appeal was brought on the ground it did not take into account mitigating circumstances, case law or sentencing principles.
HELD: The appeal against conviction was dismissed.
The driving prohibition was reduced to 9 months.
The fine and surcharge were confirmed.
1)By applying the wrong standard, the trial judge committed an error of law, but no miscarriage of justice occurred.
When the correct standard, as enunciated in Hundal, is applied to the evidence as found by the trial judge, the conviction was appropriate.
2)The application of the Stellato principle to a charge of dangerous driving under s.249(1) was an error in law.
The conclusion that the Crown need only establish proof of any degree of impairment and not a marked departure from normal behaviour does not apply to a charge under s.249.
Simple judgmental errors in routine driving do not constitute conduct amounting to a marked departure from the standard of care required.
Mere negligence or driving without due care and attention are not sufficient.
3)The accused's evidence did not address how fast he was going (he stated his speedometer was not working) nor over what route or the time of the chase.
There was ample evidence on those issues from the two Crown witnesses.
4)The findings of fact established the appellant's driving conduct did amount to a marked departure from the standard of care a reasonable person would exercise in those circumstances.
The test is whether a reasonably prudent driver in the circumstances ought to have been aware of the risk and of the danger involved in his driving conduct.
The accused engaged in a planned and deliberate course of conduct when he gave chase and continued over a significant distance at a high speed at night with children and other pedestrians in the vicinity.
It was not necessary for the Crown to establish the collision caused significant damage or that a collision occurred at all.
The acceptance of the accused's assertion that the collision was inadvertent did not mean the Crown failed to prove the necessary mens rea.
5)An 18 month prohibition was excessive.
The conduct was at the low end of the continuum.
He was employed as a truck driver and relied on his operator's licence to earn a living.
He chased the other vehicle because he believed its occupants stole tapes from his vehicle.
Although he was convicted for refusal to provide breath samples 2 years ago, alcohol was not a factor here.","[0, 1, 118, 119, 120, 117, 2, 116, 4, 3, 5, 115, 7, 8, 6, 110, 114]"

He seemed to think all he had to do was raise the matter, by way of argument, to warrant a new trial.
In the course of the argument before us, we explained to him that there are procedures that have to be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence.
Otherwise, the courts are left with no basis upon which to act upon allegations of that nature.
These procedures were not followed, and in the result there was nothing before the Court of Queen’s Bench upon which it might act, and nothing before us upon which we might act.
In the circumstances, we are all of the view that there is no tenable basis for allowing his appeal, setting aside his conviction, and ordering a new trial.
We might add that, on the facts as found by the trial judge, based on the judge’s assessments of credibility, the conduct of the accused amounted to dangerous driving within the meaning of the applicable provisions of the Criminal Code.  
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving and alleged that his estranged wife and daughter lied.

[6]                  I am satisfied that the trial judge did give sufficient reasons for her decision and took into consideration all of the relevant evidence and the law in reaching her decision.
She was entitled to assess credibility of the independent witness and the appellant, deciding to prefer the evidence of the independent witness to that of the appellant.
In doing so, the trial judge did not rely upon the testimony of any witness that was inherently improbable, and she applied the correct burden of proof, beyond a reasonable doubt, in reaching her verdict.
The verdict is not unreasonable (see R. v. B. (J.N.), 1991 CanLII 111 (SCC), [1991]
1 S.C.R. 66, 71 Man.R. (2d) 156) and there was no palpable or overriding error.

In that sense, in every defamation case where a defence is accepted, the results are mixed.
It is the nature of a defamation action.
Finding for a party on some issues, which do not affect any aspect of the remedy, does not make the results mixed.
The appeal is allowed with costs to Dr. Rubin in this Court and in the Court of Queen’s Bench.
Dr. Rubin shall have general damages against the Respondents in the amount of $100,000.
Since I have allowed the appeal, the cross-appeal is dismissed, but given that the Respondents are clearly correct 
with respect to the issue raised in the cross-appeal, it is appropriate in the circumstances of this case to dismiss it without costs.

An award of $20,000 in general damages against one set of parents was not appealed by either the plaintiffs or the defendants (see:  2006 ABQB 198 (CanLII) at paras.
306 to 309).","The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249).
The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee.
The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000.
The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000.
The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs.
HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied.
Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion.
In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice.
It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal.
The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege.
The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000.
It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law.
The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case.
The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer.
The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed.
The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant.
An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice.
The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs.
However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","[478, 481, 8, 0, 477, 476, 483, 3, 486, 484, 2, 480, 482, 4, 7, 475, 472, 485, 9, 468, 1, 469]"

While the order made may be of some inconvenience to the parties this does not constitute reversible error.
It is not our function to “fine tune” orders of this nature particularly when they are of such short duration.
We have reviewed the voluminous affidavit evidence in the record and find no misuse of judicial discretion.
The order under attack is a considered attempt to manage the situation for a short period before trial.
Furthermore, this Court has signalled its reluctance to interfere with the discretion of a chambers judge when dealing with matters of this nature.
Also see Lapoor v. Navidi (2000), 2000 SKCA 95 (CanLII), 14 R.F.L. (5th) 125.
We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Col. 5.
The respondent’s motion under Rule 15 is now moot.
Accordingly it is dismissed as moot with no costs to either party.
Since we addressed the appeal proper on its merits, the motion to “quash” is dismissed as moot with no costs to either party.","The appellant appeals from an order that directed that the daughter of the parties shall attend kindergarten in Saskatoon during the 7 week period before trial.

Despite this, I wish to refer briefly to the appeal on the basis that the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.
There is no basis in the transcript for accepting such a position.
The trial judge accepted the fact situation described by the complainant, and there is nothing in any of the evidence led either by the Crown or defence that he found to detract from her evidence.
The allegations are not that the judge erred with respect to the facts but rather the judge should not have believed the evidence provided.
         In this simple factual case, the judge believed the complainant, and as an appellate court, I am in no position to review his reasons to determine if I simply would have come to a different conclusion.
The law in this area is well established, and there is little reason to embark on a further analysis of overturning the conviction on the basis of finding fact.
The most recent and useful discussion in this area from our Court of Appeal is R. v. L.W.T., 2008 SKCA 17 (CanLII), [2008]
         The appeal is therefore dismissed.

MILLS   ","The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed.
1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred.
There was no unfairness in the trial process.
The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him.
He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on.
There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant.
He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made.
On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer.
2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant.
The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case.
He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen.
The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen.
The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v.

The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault.
The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother.
The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter.
The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her.
The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment.
The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person.
The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence.
It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex.
The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault.
It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon.
That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred.
The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant in respect of the same assault is obvious.
That question has a direct bearing on her credibility.","[187, 1, 186, 0, 185, 184, 3, 2, 6, 183, 4, 5, 8, 181, 9, 7, 182, 11, 10, 179, 12]"

[2]            On June 20, 2005, Provincial Court Judge Andrychuk convicted Westfair on the summary conviction offence.
A $3,000.00 fine was imposed as a sentence.
                                        GROUNDS OF APPEAL
Section 830(2) states that the appeal of the summary conviction offence will be based on a transcript of the proceedings or an agreed upon statement of facts.
                                                 ANALYSIS
This appeal was brought forward on three separate grounds.
However, I find that it is only necessary to address the first ground of appeal.
[15]           Westfair argues that the learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case.
This finding of fact cannot be disturbed by a summary conviction appeal judge.
To demand more, would, in my view, move a strict liability offence dangerously close to one of absolute liability.
By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law.
Had the appropriate standard of due diligence been applied to the facts of this case, Westfair would have succeeded in establishing the defence of due diligence as was decided in R. v. Wesfair Foods Ltd. and Roy H. Friesen, supra.

 1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place.
2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence.

This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person.

A non-earner in the past may well become someone whose employment income, but for the accident, would be more than the “weighted average approach”.
If a claimant has proved on a balance of probabilities that the promised employment reflects his or her earning reality, a poor past record ought not to preclude the claimant from an IRB that reflects his earning reality.
If it is greater, Montgrand has the benefit provided by s. 117(4) of the Act.
As agreed by counsel, if they are unable to agree on the calculation of the IRB, the matter may be remitted back to me.
[22]           Counsel for the appellant is entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.
If Montgrand is entitled to benefits other than what SGI has paid him, he is awarded interest on the value of those benefits not paid, from June 1, 2001 to date.
SGI did not receive information from the appellant regarding promised employment until that date, and could not act on the appellant’s information before that date.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act.
Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts.
The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator.
The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000.
This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident.
The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year.
HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality.
The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment.
The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.
 2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle.
There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3)
Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.","[101, 0, 100, 1, 99, 97, 98, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 95, 94, 7]"

The court granted a divorce, divided the matrimonial property, and dismissed the appellant’s claim for maintenance since no evidence was led with respect to it.
We can find no error in the decision of the trial judge.
The medical opinions fell far short of justifying anything other than allowing someone else to represent the appellant, but the appellant had already demonstrated an inability to obtain the services of a lawyer acceptable to him and the appellant declined to proceed with Mr. Hawke at his side.
The appellant had no suggestions as to how to proceed, but simply declined to participate.
While the condition of the appellant must be of concern, the evidence did not indicate any inability to either instruct counsel or to represent himself in court.
In the circumstances, the trial judge had little choice but to do exactly what she did.
The authorities cited by the appellant in his factum have no application to this case as they all deal with situations where a person did not appear at his trial.
In this case, the appellant appeared, but refused to participate.
For the same reason, Queen’s Bench Rule 271 has no application.
In the circumstances, we have no choice but to dismiss the appeal with costs.","The appellant appeared for his trial in a family law matter.

DECISION
According to Section 70 of The Residential Tenancies Act, 2006t[sic] I hereby Order that the Notice to Vacate dated May 7, 2009 is set aside.
[3]            A new hearing was scheduled for July 30 as Ms. Buch advised the Hearing Officer that she had not received notice of the hearing.
[4]            A letter dated August 7, 2009 to Ms. Buch, Mr. Vanin and Mr. Koch from the office of Residential Tenancies stated that ”...
after the hearing on July 29, 2009 it came to the attention of the Hearing Officer that the Landlord, Sheila Buch had made an application for possession of the property.
This was not heard on July 29th.”
[18]           However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that Mr. Vanin was entitled to the rights that the lease affords.
I have come to this conclusion on the basis that the hearing officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this matter in any respect.
[19]           There are other remedies available to Ms. Buch to obtain possession of the property in question.
And without deciding the issue, Mr. Vanin may have remedies against Mr. Koch for any damages he has suffered as a result of his dealings with Mr. Koch. 
[20]           The appeal is dismissed.
                                                                                                    E. J. GUNN","The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession.
The landlords are mother and son.
The mother lives out of province for a number of years.
She returns in summers to reside in the premises.
This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis.
She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease.
She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises.
The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords.
He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises.
HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement.
The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant.
In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute.
However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1)
A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy.
2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement.
Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion.
There was no express consent of principal and agent.
 3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel.
This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person.
The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","[0, 123, 124, 216, 217, 214, 1, 126, 213, 125, 128, 212, 127, 215]"

In fact, Dr. Arnold suggested that Mr. Gonzales may have to take the program more than once.
Without this program everyone accepts that Mr. Gonzales’ risk for sexual reoffending is substantial.
One final point mentioned in the factum of Mr. Gonzales but not pressed on appeal relates to the criticism that the trial judge overemphasized specific deterrence and denunciation and overlooked rehabilitation.
These objectives were not mentioned by the trial judge.
The indefinite sentence was imposed not to denounce Mr. Gonzales’ crimes or to deter him from committing others.
The law required the trial judge to place primary emphasis on public protection and that is what he did.
For all these reasons the appeal is dismissed.

The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts.
Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment.
Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate.
Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar.
Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change.
In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody.
He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper.
The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence.
The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions.
In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone.
In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","[212, 3, 0, 210, 211, 2, 205, 203, 209, 208, 4, 204, 206, 6, 1, 5, 9, 201, 8, 10, 202, 207, 200, 7]"

The grounds relied on by Cajon give rise to the following issues:          (1)
Did the adjudicator err in law by                finding that the respondent Kovach by                her conduct had not frustrated or                fundamentally breached her employment                contract?          (2)
Whether the adjudicator exceeded his                jurisdiction by holding that Cajon,                as Ms.  Kovach's employer, had an                obligation to attempt to resolve                place of work difficulties that                prohibited her from reporting to                work?
Therefore, the appeal based on the submission that the adjudicator erred in law by ruling that the employment contract was not frustrated by Ms. Kovach's conduct is dismissed.
[10]           The second ground of appeal based on the adjudicator exceeding his jurisdiction also fails.
In my view, the adjudicator acted well within his jurisdiction when determining what the terms of Ms. Kovach's employment contract were and that Cajon had not fulfilled obligations thereunder.
Although not all of the facts presented to him are known to this Court, his decision outlines some evidence  upon which he could have arrived at his conclusions.
[11]           The appeal is dismissed with costs.                                                            J.","The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act.
The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination.
The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work.
The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked.
The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges.
She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.
1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended.
The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.
 2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one.
The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law.
The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them.
4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","[66, 65, 2, 63, 64, 3, 1, 62, 4]"

The appellant seeks to have the respondent’s income increased by adding the value of unsold grain on hand and 100 percent of his capital cost allowance.
There is clearly no basis for adding the value of the grain on hand to the income of the respondent.
There is no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and this grain is therefore to be viewed as part of the gross income of the respondent in the year in which it is sold.
The respondent agreed to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income and this was accepted by the trial judge who recognized that commercial realities require the replacement of farm equipment.
What, if any, portion of the capital cost allowance should be added to establish available income must be based on the facts of each case and we see no reversible error in the acceptance of this figure by the chamber judge in this instance.
The appeal is dismissed with the usual costs on double Column V.","The appellant sought to have the support payments ordered by the chambers judge increased on the basis the income of the respondent was incorrectly estimated and should have been increased by adding the value of unsold grain on hand and 100 percent of his capital cost allowance.

APPELLANT
Here the Queen’s Bench judge in his appellate capacity focussed on one sentence where the trial judge said:
I think the evidence ... has to be relatively specific on the issue of money for specific sexual services.
However on a reading of the entire oral judgment, we are of the view she was, in effect, saying that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place.
The fact that she was not adding the need for a specific conversation is buttressed by the submission of counsel for the appellant that immediately before giving oral judgment she had refused a motion for nonsuit.
Were she to have been of the view that such an element was necessary it is probable she would have granted the nonsuit.
Thus, while noting that the statement of law by the judge of the Court of Queen’s Bench in his appellate capacity was correct, we are the view that the appropriate disposition is to set aside his judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence.","The appellant was acquitted of communicating with another person for the purpose of prostitution.
A new trial was ordered on the basis that the Provincial Court judge included a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with the respect to payment of money for specified sexual services.
The Queen's Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test that set out in R. v. Schmidt.
HELD: The proper disposition is to set aside the judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence.
1)On reading the entire oral judgment the court concluded that the judge was saying in effect that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place.

From:               Q.B. No. 307 of 2009 - J.C. of Prince Albert
We are in general agreement with the decision of the Chambers judge.
In dealing with count 4, the trial judge learned only of the Crown’s allegation that Mr. Rathgeber had driven while disqualified pursuant to ss. 253 and 254 of the Code.
This was not enough to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.
It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories.
The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making.
Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused’s criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial.
We are not persuaded by the argument advanced on behalf of Mr. Rathgeber.
No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge’s decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.
Conclusion
Mr. Rathgeber’s appeal must be dismissed.
This matter is remitted to the trial judge in order that the case can be concluded.","The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.
He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code.
The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty.
The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings.
That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court.
At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity.
He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.'
The trial judge dismissed the application to quash.
He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways:
The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.'
Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed.
The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record.
The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench.
In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety.
Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count.
More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction.
This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed.
The test for apprehension of bias is well settled.
The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.).
The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude.
It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories.
The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making.
Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial.
No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.","[96, 0, 95, 93, 1, 94, 3, 2, 92, 4, 6, 90, 7, 89, 5, 88, 8, 87, 85, 9, 10, 86]"

8.            Such further grounds as counsel may advice [sic] and this Honourable Court may allow.
[3]            The appellant’s memorandum of law and oral argument, however, dealt only with the contention that the police officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to arrest him and to demand that he provide a sample of his breath for analysis, thereby infringing his right under ss. 8 and 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11 (the “Charter”).
Therefore I will deal only with that ground of appeal.
LAW AND ANALYSIS
[21]           The appellant argues that at the time Cst. Forrester took the appellant to the police vehicle, she was not certain if she had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a breath sample or whether she should use an ASD.
However when she got to the police vehicle and the appellant was placed in the police vehicle, she very soon thereafter made a demand for a sample of the appellant’s breath.
[23]           The appellant refers to R. v. Shepherd, 2007 SKCA 29 (CanLII), [2007]
The trial judge’s decision was correct.
Cst. Forrester had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant’s breath, and the appellant’s claim for breach of the Charter must fail.
[30]           The appeal is therefore dismissed.
                                                                                             P.A. WHITMORE","The appellant was convicted of driving over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code.
The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts.
The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes.
The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath.","[92, 23, 0, 130, 129, 128, 1, 93, 127, 94, 21, 96, 22]"

Similarly, in Burns [1994 CanLII 127 (SCC), [1994]
Courts of appeal often state the test in terms of whether there is evidence upon which the trier of fact properly instructed could reasonably reach the verdict.
I am satisfied that the learned trial judge analysed all of the evidence before him as was appropriate, rather than using a piecemeal approach, which was rejected in the case of R. v. Hall, supra.
Having reviewed the transcript, I am satisfied that there was ample evidence to justify the learned trial judge’s conclusion that the appellant’s ability to be in the care and control of a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.
The learned trial judge made no palpable or overriding error to justify overturning his decision: R. v. Yebes, 1987 CanLII 17 (SCC), [1987]
2 S.C.R. 168, and R. v. Bigsky, supra .
Conclusion
The appeal against the conviction is dismissed.
                                                   N.G. Gabrielson","The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations.
The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force.
The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth.
In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath.
The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer.
He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer.
The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses.
The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation.
The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer.
There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility.
The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b).
Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause.
While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment.
The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected.
The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato.
There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","[188, 185, 1, 186, 0, 184, 183, 189, 4, 2, 187, 182, 180, 179, 3, 8, 6, 178]"

Disposition:        Appeal dismissed
In Concurrence:  The Honourable Mr. Justice Cameron
While I agree that the sentence imposed was at the high end of the available range, I am unable to conclude that it was outside the range available on the circumstances of this case.
The respondent had a previous record of five previous convictions for impaired driving in addition to other offences.
He was speeding and driving on the wrong side of the road and collided head on with a vehicle driven and occupied by the victims.
Although that case dealt with a technically more serious offence, the circumstances of the two cases do not differ substantially.
Accordingly, I am unable to conclude that the sentence imposed in this case was outside the appropriate range of sentences.
The sentencing judge made no error of principle and the sentence was not demonstrably unfit.
      DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 23rd day of December, A.D. 2008.

                                     LANE J.A.","The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code.
He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand.
The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence.
On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction.
He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
 1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988]
1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case.
This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case.
See R. v. Underwood, [1998]
1 S.C.R. 77.
As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.
 2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'.
Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them.
Defence counsel did not object to them.
However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.
 3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction.
No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed.
This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4)
The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code.
The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a).
There is no merit in this ground of appeal.
Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner.
5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable.
In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving.
The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence.
Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice.
The appeal from conviction is dismissed.
6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment.
While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","[356, 3, 350, 0, 355, 354, 349, 348, 353, 1, 4, 7, 352, 6, 2, 8, 344, 5, 351, 11, 12, 15, 9, 346, 340]"

The Chambers judge refused to grant relief, finding the issues to be academic in nature and within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University, but ruled his supervisor should be removed from the Committee because of an apprehension of bias.
The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed.
The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure.
He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V.
1)The material did not meet the test for the admission of fresh evidence.
It simply restated what was at issue and found to have had no effect.
2)There was no tenable basis for interfering.

3)The Court was not prepared to grant the relief in any event, given the long delay in seeking recourse.
The initial concern was bias and jurisdiction.
The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below.
4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations.

This also amounted to an error of fact or mixed law and fact.
Although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W. (D.), 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991]

CREDIBILITY
Again no miscarriage of justice resulted.
                                                NECESSITY
                            Much of the appellant’s evidence was devoted to presenting a defence of necessity.
The appellant testified that when the complainant left his truck and retreated into the dense brush he became concerned for her safety.
The appellant was conscious of bears and insects that could threaten the welfare of the complainant at night.
In my view, the trial judge failed to properly consider the defence of necessity.
That was an error of law.
                            It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal for the conviction.
Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to the same conclusion.
Accordingly, I allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and order a new trial before a judge of the Provincial Court for Saskatchewan.","The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity.
The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed.
The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered.
1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law.
No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.
 2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why.
It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility.
Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault.
Again no miscarriage of justice resulted.
3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity.
The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided.
The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality.
The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant.
It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal.
Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","[25, 0, 113, 82, 112, 81, 1, 24, 111, 83, 41, 80, 2, 110, 26, 109, 60, 22, 23, 85]"

       Since the appellant's complaints must be passed upon in a factual and procedural context, we find it convenient to first review the relevant factual background.
       On 20 August 1990 the respondent Ruth Graff was injured while riding as a passenger in the appellant's vehicle.
       At the time of trial Ruth Graff was 45 years of age.
       Before the collision the respondent enjoyed excellent health.

At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident.
The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings.
The Respondent/Plaintiff cross-appealed on the issue of whether the trial judge should have directed the jury to deduct sick leave benefits from her past loss of income.
Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done.
The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court.
2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert.
3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance.
4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected.
5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered.
6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","[28, 0, 50, 459, 460, 49, 456, 455, 454, 453, 53, 1, 452, 451, 51, 27, 449, 56, 448, 458, 450]"

            I find counsel’s submission in this regard to have no basis.
The cause of action in this case was one of negligent misrepresentation.
The trial judge made a finding of both fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation and her findings in this regard have not been challenged.
See S.M. Waddams, The Law of Damages, 2nd ed., looseleaf (Toronto: Canada Law Book, 2009) at 5-19, para. 5.460.
Hancock may then have elected not to proceed with the purchase contract or alternatively remedied the defect before the wall collapsed inward.
There is no evidence that the amount of work done was not necessary to repair the damage done when the foundation caved in and water entered the basement.
            In my opinion, the trial judge made no palpable and overriding error regarding the calculation of damages and I would therefore dismiss this ground of appeal as well.
Conclusion
            This appeal is dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent.
                                                                                                                N.G. GABRIELSON","The appellants appealed a small claims judgment.
The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement.
When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one.
He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall.
The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced.
The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair.
The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair.
Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam.
The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did.
The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state.
The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it.
The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation.
The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up.
The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made.
In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","[225, 226, 1, 2, 0, 224, 5, 223, 3, 221, 6, 217, 9, 215, 8, 11, 7, 4, 214, 222, 10, 219]"

Again, the allegations might have been pleaded more specifically, including more specific identification of the amounts involved and the dates upon which they are alleged to have been diverted.
But without at least giving Carry the Kettle First Nation the opportunity to amend its pleadings in these respects so as to be more specific, the allegations cannot fairly be struck out as not answering to the requirements of Rule 149, albeit barely so perhaps.
And discovery, both documentary and oral, lies ahead.
On the whole, then, we have decided to allow the appeal, set aside the order under appeal, and dismiss the application to strike.
The application is dismissed without prejudice to Ms Thompson’s rights to again turn to the Court of Queen’s Bench, in one context or another, to seek further specifics of the alleged fraud.
In the circumstances, we have decided to allow the appeal but without an order for costs in favour of Carry the Kettle First Nations.   
In leaving the case we want to commend counsel.
They presented the case on appeal in keeping with the best traditions of the legal profession, a matter their clients should know about and appreciate.","The appellants appealed the order of a Queen's Bench chamber's judge striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim.
HELD: The chamber's judge was in error in striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim.
The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application.
The Court of Appeal opted to deal with the merits of the application themselves, rather than remitting the matter back to Queen's Bench.
While the allegation of fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, the pleading is nevertheless sufficient to answer the requirements of QB Rule 173.
The appellants should have been given an opportunity to amend their pleadings.
The appeal was allowed and the application to strike was dismissed without prejudice to respondent's right to seek further particulars.","[0, 34, 35, 1, 2, 33, 3, 4, 32, 31, 5, 30, 6, 7, 28, 8, 27]"

The Honourable Mr. Justice Vancise
We are all of the opinion that the evidence was clearly available, clearly contemplated by the parties and for whatever reason not called.
We are not persuaded that the application to adduce fresh evidence in this case should be allowed.
The application to adduce fresh evidence and to amend the statement of defence is denied.
Dealing with the appeal proper, we are allo f the opinion it must be denied.
The standard of review is that as articulated in Lensen v. Lensen, 1987 CanLII 4 (SCC), [1987]
We are not persuaded in the circumstances of this case that the trial judge either misapprehended or failed to take into account evidence which was before him in arriving at his conclusion concerning the causation of the fire.
There was evidence which, if accepted, would permit the trial judge to make the findings of fact that he did and to award the damages based on those findings.
The appeal is dismissed with costs on double Column V, including costs of the motion to adduce fresh evidence.","The appellants applied to adduce fresh evidence and to amend the statement of claim.
The appellant's solicitor at the time of the trial had called no expert evidence concerning either the proper construction of the chimney, which was alleged to be faultily constructed, or the cause of the fire.

In this case the strictness of the due diligence requirement should be relaxed in light of the allegation of arson.
Although the expert evidence of Mr. Jones was available, counsel at trial failed to competently present this evidence on behalf of the appellants:  see for example Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. George Leslie Wilson Freeman, unreported, Sask. C.A., March 14, 1996.
We also find that the proffered fresh evidence could reasonably have affected the result at trial, particularly with respect to the ""cause of the fire"".
The appellants shall pay the respondent's costs of the trial, to be taxed on a party and party basis, on or before July 15, 2000.
The appellants shall also pay the respondent's costs of all proceedings in this Court including this motion and 
preparation for the appeal, with the same to be taxed on double Column V and paid on or before July 15, 2000.
In default of payment of these costs, the appellant shall be liable, on application to this Court, to have their claim struck out and the action dismissed.","The appellants sought to admit fresh evidence.

[2]                  Before convicting the appellants, the trial justice heard evidence:
First, whatever definition of “livestock” is used, the definition always includes cattle.
Second, in order to determine whether Bylaw 2‑1995 has been breached by the keeping of cattle, one does not need to identify each animal that may be included in the word “livestock”.
One needs only to know whether cattle are included in the word “livestock”.
They are included, since cattle are “livestock” under any definition of the word.
            The uncertainty suggested by the appellants does not exist.
Under Bylaw 2‑1995 no livestock is permitted in the district.
Cattle are livestock, and so cattle are not permitted in the district.
            The appellants fail on this argument.
Conclusion
            The trial justice made no error in law.
His findings of fact were supported by the evidence.
That being the case, there is no basis on which to reverse the trial decision.
The appeal is dismissed.
G.M. Currie","The appellants were found guilty of breaching a rural municipal bylaw which provides 'That no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned Hamlet [sic].'
There were four grounds of appeal: 1) an application to admit new evidence on appeal; 2) a constitutional challenge seeking a declaration that the bylaw was ultra vires for uncertainty; 3) the significance of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw; and 4) the meaning of the word 'livestock' in the bylaw.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed.
1) New evidence will not be admitted on an appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial.
Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial.
Neither of these requirements is met.
2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned.
In any event, the uncertainty on which the appellants rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist.
3) The appellants misunderstand the use of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw.
4) Whatever definition of 'livestock' is used, the definition always includes cattle.","[120, 119, 0, 121, 1, 117, 4, 2, 118, 115, 5, 116, 3, 112, 7, 6, 114, 10, 113, 9, 111, 8, 110, 11, 14, 108, 109]"

[3]               Each of the respondents issued comprehensive general liability policies in favour of Westridge.
First, it is for the insured to demonstrate that the claim advanced comes within the insuring agreement.
If the insured satisfies this burden, then it is for the insurer to establish that a claim that would otherwise be covered is excluded by some term in the policy.
[7]               The relevant portions of the statement of claim setting forth the claim made by Genex against Westridge are the following:
(x)      failed to comply rigidly with the manufacturers latest printed instructions in the methods and materials to be used in the installation of the work; and/or
(xi)     failed to notify Genex in writing that the specifications, as modified by its tender (and in particular, the use of the Galvalume alternate), conflicted manufacturers’ instructions.
         The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship.
                                                                     VIII
         Again, the essence of the pleadings by Genex is that Westridge failed to provide the work or product bargained for under the contract.
                                                                      IX
         In the result, the application is dismissed with costs.","The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant.
The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn.
The applicant was the general contractor.
Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant.
The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend.
If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered.
The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.
 1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship.
They are not performance bonds.
2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship.
3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident.
What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence.
Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend.","[0, 305, 16, 40, 298, 297, 1, 275, 17, 39, 276, 18, 97, 98, 42]"

The issues also relate to 15 other properties and as the issues are the same for each property they were decided by the Assessment Appeals Committee on one appeal.
The Assessment Appeals Committee dismissed the appeals, finding the issue not to be a matter of the Assessor's Discretion but a matter of professional interpretation of data.
The Committee found the Board of Revision did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err on the issue of abnormal obsolescence for size.
HELD: Leave to appeal was granted on two questions of law.
 1) Did the Committee err in its interpretation and application of the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual by failing to find that economic obsolescence for size must be categorized on a MAF by MAF basis? 2)
Did the Committee err by failing to find the Assessor should have used the comparable unit method to determine whether an adjustment for obsolescence for size should be applied to the applicant's property?
3) On the use of invalid sales leave was denied on the basis the question of the sale is a question of fact and in argument the applicant said for its purposes the impugned sale did not matter.
4) Leave to appeal was denied on the issue of the standard of proof that there was no error demonstrated.","[0, 82, 83, 81, 1, 3, 2, 80, 4, 78, 5, 79, 77, 7, 75, 6, 8, 76, 73, 9, 72]"

December 7, 1999  
[1]               There are several issues to be determined on this application.
Move to Medicine Hat and Related Issues:
[5]               The applicant has interim possession and exclusive use of the matrimonial home and contents pursuant to the order of the court made November 23, 1998.
By that order, the court designed the primary residence of the two children (aged six and three and one-half years) to be with the applicant and the respondent was granted access every second weekend.
By subsequent order made December 7, 1998, the respondent was granted additional access to include Thursday or Monday, when the weekend falls on a statutory holiday, and the applicant was prohibited from removing the children from Saskatchewan without a court order, absent consent.
The respondent has other suitable accommodation.
[9]               The applicant is directed to take all reasonable steps to sell the fifth-wheel recreational trailer in her possession and to pay the sales proceeds to the bank to discharge the lien indebtedness (approximately $25,000) and to pay the balance into court.
The applicant is directed to thereafter deliver and file an affidavit of bona fides as to the sale which should relieve her of the obligation for payment of the loan (approximately $800 monthly).
         Costs are reserved to trial.","The applicant asserted the third party (the respondent's father's company) paid $55,000 to the respondent's company in contravention of the June 7, 1999 order which directed any funds accruing to the company be paid into court and froze any money to be paid out.
The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial.
The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access.
The applicant had been prohibited in a 1998 order from removing the children from Saskatchewan without a court order, absent consent.HELD: 1)The issue of the payments was directed to trial and pre-trial conference to be held in January.
2)The mother was granted leave to move the children to Alberta.
Their primary residence was to continue to be with her.
She was encouraged to attain self-sufficiency.
Access was to be maintained and the mother was ordered to return the children to Saskatchewan for purposes of allowing the respondent to exercise access in accordance with existing orders.
Additional access was granted provided he picked up and returned the children to the applicant's residence.
3)The 1998 interim order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home was not changed.
The applicant was at liberty to rent the home.
4)The applicant was directed to take all reasonable steps to sell the recreational trailer in her possession and to pay the sale proceeds to the bank to discharge the lien and the balance into court.
She was to file an affidavit of bona fides as to the sale which should relieve her of the obligation for payment of the loan.
 5)Costs were reserved to the trial.","[0, 43, 26, 27, 14, 15, 42, 1, 28, 13, 2, 41, 40, 29]"

[4]            In support of the application Yvonne Tyler her own affidavit and the affidavit of Brenda Walper-Bossence, the lawyer who prepared the testator’s will.
[5]            In response to this application, Barry Douglas Shade, the executor of the November 3, 2005 will filed his affidavit.

[26]           Yvonne Tyler asks that the will be proven in solemn form, to determine whether there was undue influence on the testator, based on the application of the test as outlined in Dieno Estate v. Dieno Estate, 1996 CanLII 6762 (SK QB), [1996] 10 W.W.R. 375 (Sask. Q.B.); (1996), 147 Sask. R. 14 and more recently enumerated by our Court of Appeal in Royal Trust Corp. of Canada v.

HELD: The evidence from the lawyer who prepared the Testator's last Will was that she was concerned that the testator was being influenced.
The evidence from the executor of the Estate raises no such concerns.
Based on the evidence, the conflict in the evidence and the law, the issue of undue influence cannot be resolved without a trial of the issue.

January 21, 1998      The applicant, Clifford Ray, commenced an application pursuant to s.19 of  The Controverted Municipal Elections Act (the ""Act"") following the municipal election for mayor and counsellors at the Northern Village of Sandy Bay, Saskatchewan, on October 22, 1997.      The applicant showed reasonable grounds for contesting the validity of the election and the Chambers judge granted the fiat to allow the applicant to serve the notice of motion to determine this matter.
The application under s.19(1) of the Act was filed on December 8, 1997, and the fiat was granted on the same day.
The application is out of time.      Before disposing of the matter, I grant counsel leave to file further affidavit material proving the date the returning officer declared the results of this vote.
It is that date which is crucial in calculating the time limit for this applicant.
If it is sometime after October 22, 1997 and within the time period as I have interpreted the legislation, this matter is to be brought back before me.                                                      J.

The Chambers judge granted the fiat to allow the applicant to serve the notice of motion and service was made within two weeks of the date of the fiat.
The respondents argued there was no jurisdiction to deal with the motion because the applicant had missed the limitation period for bringing this application as s19(1) of the Act states the application must be brought within six weeks after the election.
The fiat was granted beyond the time limit forty seven days later.
The applicant argued the time limit did not commence until after the completion of the judicial recount provided by s126-128 of the Local Government Election Act.
HELD: 1)Leave was granted to file further affidavit material proving the date the returning officer declared the results of the vote which was the crucial date for calculating the time limit for this application.
 2)The legislation is clear.
Section 103 of the Local Government Election Act states the deputy returning officer shall count the vote and provide a prescribed statement of results.
3)There was no evidence of the date the returning officer declared the results of the vote in accordance with s109.
If the returning officer declared the results on October 22/97, that date is the commencement of the six week limitation period and the application would be out of time.","[28, 1, 27, 26, 0]"

This credit shall be applied to the fees before Dr. Pearlman is required to pay any additional money.
I will retain jurisdiction to address any matters that arise with respect to implementation of this award.
DATED at the City of Saskatoon, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 8th day of September, 2005.
Visitor","The applicant is a doctor enrolled in the orthopaedic surgery residency training program at the University of Saskatchewan (University).
He was suspended from the program since approximately March 2000.
There have been a number of legal proceedings between the applicant and the University since then.
An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms.
This decision has not been implemented.
At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments.
The applicant is such a student.
His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended.
The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program.
The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter.
HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding.
The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts.
2) The applicant is entitled to relief.
The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met.
The applicant must enter into a written agreement with the College of Medicine whereby he agrees that the money he was paid while on suspension is prepayment for all of the services he will perform for the College of Medicine in the remainder of his residency, that he will not claim any salary or monetary benefits available to other medical residents pursuant to the PAIRS agreement, and he will indemnify the College of Medicine if it is required to make payments to him pursuant to the PAIRS agreement during the remainder of his residency program.
Further, PAIRS will enter into an agreement with the College of Medicine waiving the financial terms of the PAIRS agreement with respect to the applicant for the duration of his residency.
3) The applicant will be responsible for paying tuition fees, administration fees, insurance fees and any other college fees payable by other medical residents but he will be granted a credit for the fees deducted by the College of Medicine during the time he was suspended.","[0, 9, 35, 36, 223, 221, 225, 37, 38, 219, 224]"

(d)     There is no restriction in the Bylaw limiting the right of the Commercial Owners to vote on positions to the Board.
B.        Relevant sections of Bylaw No. 1 of Spadina Condominium Corporation
            The relevant sections of Bylaw No. 1 are:
Subject to subsections (2) and (5) to (12), each owner has a number of votes that bears the same proportion to the total number of votes as the owner’s unit factor bears to the total of the unit factors.
Subject to the right of any owner to ask for a vote by unit factors in person or by proxy, the bylaws of a corporation may provide for voting by show of hands for specified  purposes.
Unless otherwise provided for in this Act, all questions proposed for the consideration of the owners at a meeting of owners shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast.
For all of the reasons as outlined in this decision, the application of the applicant is dismissed.
As indicated to counsel at the time of the application, if the matter of costs cannot be resolved as amongst the parties, leave is given to the parties to argue the matter of costs at a time to be arranged with the Local Registrar.","The applicant is a residential unit owner in the condominium corporation.
He sought a declaration pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 interpreting the bylaws of the condominium corporation with respect to the voting rights of the commercial unit owners.
The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units.
The remaining 29 units are residential.
The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors.
A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders.
The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board.
HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw.
There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners.
Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting.
The proper interpretation of the bylaws has nothing to do with the principles of contract interpretation.
The application was dismissed.
The interpretation of the bylaw by the Board of Directors was reasonable and that Court was not prepared to interfere with it.","[88, 87, 220, 141, 0, 1, 142, 86, 218, 140]"

It is open to the Hearing Officer to find facts and come to conclusions as long as there was evidence before her upon which she based those findings.
In this case, there was evidence to support the Hearing Officer's factual decision and all of her findings.
It is not open to this Court to overturn those findings of fact.
The appellant's grounds of appeal are based on wrongful factual conclusions, which are not questions of law and this Court has no jurisdiction to overturn those findings.

The provisions of the loan agreement do not violate the provisions of the Income Tax Act.          The provisions of the Plan Contract regarding transfers of an annuitant's interest have not been complied with.
Therefore, Ms. Corscadden's interest in the Group Plan remains in place and no pension refund or ""market value of her account"" exists upon which Crown Life's security interest can attach.          Ms. Corscadden's application is dismissed.
No costs are awarded to either party in the circumstances.                                                             J. ","The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees.
The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee.
To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan.
Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier.
When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances.
She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security.
HELD: Application dismissed.
1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act.
2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy.
The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused.
3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan.
4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer.
In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan.
There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","[86, 87, 1, 85]"

Provision of Particulars.
[7]               The notice of hearing sets out one charge against the applicant, that being that he is guilty of professional misconduct, as that is defined in the Act.
Section 24 of the Act sets out the definition of professional misconduct.
The Notice of Hearing particularizes the factual allegations on which the charge is based.
         In addition, the applicant alleges that his Charter rights will be infringed if the discipline committee determines that whatever occurred while he was picketing Planned Parenthood amounts to professional misconduct within the meaning of the Act.
It is not possible to determine whether this would be so without a hearing to determine the facts.
         I am satisfied that the Act provides an adequate alternative remedy which should be pursued and find there are no special circumstances here upon which I would exercise my discretion to determine the merits of this application or provide the relief sought by the applicant.

The SAPLN shall have its costs of this application to be taxed.","The applicant sought a declaration that the charges against her could not constitute professional misconduct without contravening the Charter and Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; an order of prohibition to prevent the SAPLN discipline committee or Association from hearing the charges; a declaration that the charges are res judicata; an order for particulars; costs.

 1)No order for further particulars was made at this time.
The Hearing Notice particularizes the factual allegations and is specific as to time and their nature. 2)The only matter previously considered by the discipline committee dealt with whether there was any professional misconduct established arising out of criminal convictions for illegal picketing prior to the applicant becoming a member of SALPN.
3)The Act provides an adequate alternate remedy, which should be pursued.
There were no special circumstances upon which the court could exercise its discretion to determine the merits of this application or to provide the relief sought.","[84, 55, 83, 2, 56, 0, 57, 82, 51, 58, 81, 54, 59, 40, 80]"

POTASSIUM SULPHATE COMPANY ALSASK INC.
The applicant has also been aware for some time of PSC Alsask’s May 10, 1999 receivership when the applicant ostensibly offered to purchase PSC Alsask’s assets from the receiver.
The respondent Robert Nylen makes his living marketing and selling potassium sulphate.
That is his only livelihood and if the injunction is granted he would ostensibly lose that livelihood.
When comparing the situations of the applicant, and the respondent Potassium Sulphate Company Alsask Inc., the affidavits disclose that both of these corporate entities believe they would suffer significant harm, in the case of the applicant if the injunction is not granted, and in the case of the corporate respondent, if the application is granted.
On balance, I am satisfied that the respondent corporation would suffer greater harm if the injunction were granted, than would the applicant corporation suffer if the injunction were not granted at this stage of the litigation.
            Accordingly, I am of the view that the applicant has not, on the second and third stages of the three stage test, demonstrated an entitlement to the obtaining of injunctive relief and accordingly I dismiss the application for an interlocutory injunction with costs to the respondents in any event of the cause.","The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction pursuant to s.65 of the Queen's Bench Act and Queen's Bench Rule 387(a) prohibiting and restraining the respondents from producing and manufacturing potassium sulphate near Alsask until further order; an order restraining the respondent from selling, marketing, or disposing of the potassium sulphate for profit until further order; other ancillary relief; costs of the application.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents in any event of the cause.
The applicant did not demonstrate an entitlement to injunctive relief on the second and third stages of the three stage test.
The applicant demonstrated there was a serious question to be tried but failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm.
The delay (the action was commenced February 16, 1998) was considered.
On balance the respondents would suffer greater harm if the injunction were granted as the respondent Nylen makes his living marketing and selling potassium sulphate.","[221, 0, 1, 3, 2, 218, 6, 4, 220, 222, 5, 219, 213]"

The applicant seeks an order pursuant to s. 130 of The Land titles Act S.S. c. L-5 and s. 56 of The Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act (EMOA)S.S. c. E-9.2 for an Order relieving the LORNE EDWARD WILLITS Estate (the deceased) from payment of maintenance order by Johnson J.(as he then was) on November 28, 1972.
Section 130 of the Land Titles Act in part reads as follows:
130            For the purposes of this section, “claimant”, “maintenance order” and “respondent” have the same meanings as ascribed to them In The Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act.
A maintenance order may be discharged by filing in the Land Titles Office in which the maintenance order is filed.
There is no evidence of the circumstances surrounding the transfer from the deceased to the applicant.
The court should hear evidence viva voce.
                      I order the trial of an issue.
The respondent will assert her right to recover arrears of maintenance pursuant to the order of November 29,1972.
The applicant will defend the action and assert her right to a discharge of the order pursuant to s. 56 of the EMOA.
The costs of this application will be determine, by the trial judge.","The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.130 of the Land Titles Act and s.56 of the Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act for an order relieving the estate from payment of maintenance ordered in 1972.
The respondent objected to the application being brought on behalf of the estate as Olson was neither executrix nor a beneficiary under the Will.
The Will had not been admitted to probate.
The respondent had divorced testator in 1972 and was granted child support of $60 per month and monthly spousal support of $40.
The applicant who cohabited with the deceased since 1978 transferred her home to him in 1980 as joint tenants and he transferred his two and one-half quarter sections of farm land to the applicant.
The applicant suggested there was an agreement whereby the respondent lived rent free in the matrimonial home in lieu of support.
The respondent received welfare to support herself and the children and had had no funds to pursue enforcement of the unpaid support payments.
HELD: 1)The style of cause was amended to show Olson as applicant.
She was an interested party within the meaning of s.56 of the EMOA and entitled to bring the application on her own behalf.
The respondent was not misled and there was no prejudice.
2)The Land Titles Act was of no assistance to the applicant.
The application was to be determined upon s.56 of the EMOA and whether it would be grossly unfair and inequitable to refuse the application.
3)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge.
There was no evidence presented either of consideration being paid nor of what became of the income generated by the land prior to the deceased's death.
 4)A trial of an issue was ordered to determine what if any portion of the arrears should remain a charge upon the lands.
Some of the evidence conflicted.
Viva voce evidence should be heard.","[65, 1, 64, 63, 2, 4, 62, 61, 5, 60, 3, 8]"

Section 49(1) reads as follows:
Any person who is aggrieved by a decision or order of the Rentalsman may appeal the decision or order on a question of law or of jurisdiction of the Rentalsman to a judge of Her Majesty’s Court of Queen’s Bench for Saskatchewan within 30 days of the date of the decision or order.
[3]               The decision of the Rentalsman in this instance was rendered on December 8, 1997.

[5]               Since there is nothing in the Act which allows this Court to extend the time for filing an appeal, to deny the applicant an opportunity to bring the application for judicial review would be to deny her an opportunity to pursue her only remedy in the circumstances.
[6]               Therefore, the preliminary objection by counsel for the respondent, Nadine Onoushko, to the application is dismissed and the local registrar is instructed to return the matter to the chambers’ list on August 19, 1999 in order to hear argument on the merits and to allow counsel for the respondents an opportunity to file material.","The applicant sought an Order quashing a decision of the Office of the Rentalsman pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664(1) and 674.
The respondent raised a preliminary objection, arguing that the matter should not proceed by way of judicial review but that the applicant should be restricted to an appeal of the Rentalsman's decision under s.49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, and that the applicant had failed to do so within the prescribed 30 day limit.
The applicant argued that she never received any notice of proceedings making it impossible for her to appeal within 30 days.
HELD: Preliminary objection dismissed.
The court ordered that the application be returned to the Chamber's list for a hearing on the merits.

IN BANKRUPTCY
IN THE MATTER OF THE BANKRUPTCY OF 
MARCEL ERNEST JOBIN
W. John Hampton, for the bankrupt
W. Brent Gough, for the objecting creditor, the Trustees of the Saskatchewan Student Aid Fund
The bankrupt's net income is modest and well below the superintendents guideline for a single person.
Counsel for the objecting creditor contends that even though the bankrupt's income is minimal, he still has the capacity to make a small payment toward his obligations.
The trustee, on the other hand, recommends an absolute discharge.
After carefully considering the submissions and bearing in mind the objects and principles of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, I have reluctantly concluded that an absolute order of discharge is appropriate.
While I am not impressed with the bankrupt's attitude, it would be futile to impose a conditional order of discharge in this situation due to the bankrupt's low income.
The bankrupt is obviously a very intelligent and capable individual.
I sincerely hope that he somehow finds a way to complete his degree in veterinary medicine at some point in the future.
There will be an order granting the bankrupt an absolute order of discharge with no order as to costs.
Registrar in Bankruptcy","The applicant sought an order requesting an absolute order of discharge in bankruptcy.
The bankrupt was indebted to Canada Student Loans and Saskatchewan Student Loans.
He had obtained a Bachelor of Science degree but was unable to complete his final year of Veterinary Medicine because he had received the maximum amount of financing available.
The bankrupt had been employed for 5 years as a taxi driver earning a less than average income; he lived at home with his parents; he was single with no dependents.
He was reluctant to leave secure employment in an effort to obtain employment related to his educational qualifications.
Counsel for the objecting creditor argued that the bankrupt had a minimal income and had the capacity to make small payments toward his obligation.
HELD: An absolute order of discharge was granted in accordance with the principles of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.","[39, 0, 1, 38, 2, 36, 37, 3, 4, 35, 5, 34, 33, 6, 7, 32, 31, 8]"

April 18, 1997          By virtue of a petition dated August 14, 1996, the applicant herein seeks the appointment of the said Ronald Mervin Cathcart as property guardian for Selwyn Hand, pursuant to section 19 of The Dependent Adults Act (Saskatchewan).
The proposed dependent adult, Selwyn Roy Hand resists that application.          The following judgment is my resolution of the application and related matters.
BACKGROUND          The proposed dependent adult, Selwyn Roy Hand, was born on the 4th day of August, 1920 and at this time is seventy-six years of age.
Accordingly, I fix the sum of $7,000.00 to be paid to the applicant herein as a portion of the costs of these proceedings.
The Public Trustee will then administer such funds in accordance with the normal powers and procedures of his office, acting in the best interests of Mr. Hand.          The parties have leave to apply to me for further and other incidental direction in pursuance of this judgment.                                       _________________________                                           ALLBRIGHT J. ","The applicant sought to be appointed as property guardian for his uncle pursuant to s19 of the Dependent Adults Act.
The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years.
The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs.
He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951.
Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew.
There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand.
The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property.
However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit.
His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest.
2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.
 3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand.
One half of the proceeds were to be provided directly to Hand to be dealt with as he chooses and the remaining half were to be administered by the Public Trustee in his longer term best interests according to the normal powers and procedures of that office.","[1, 2, 131, 134, 0]"

The first is that there is a significant tax saving to the applicant respecting  payments he makes for spousal support.
It is not evident from the material that either he or his planner have adequately taken this into account.
The second is that the applicant could also supplement his own income by selling his residence and purchasing some form of annuity.
An adjustment period is also called for in the circumstances.
            It is ordered that commencing April 1, 2000, the ongoing spousal support payable by the applicant to the respondent shall be $1,750.00 per month up to and including March 1, 2001.
From and after April 1, 2001 until further order, the amount of spousal support shall be $1,250.00.
            There is no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent.
It is evident that the applicant has retired and has no intention to become re-employed.
It is essential that he know now what his future obligations will be.
            As each party has had some measure of success, no costs are awarded to either.","The applicant sought to vary the 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing spousal support of $2,500 per month.
The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP.
Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed.
HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.
 1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts.
The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.
 2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension.
3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions.
However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired.
The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home.
She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property.
The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge).
There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs.","[111, 0, 109, 2, 1, 110, 108, 3, 4, 5, 107, 6, 105, 106, 7, 103, 8, 9, 102, 101]"

LEGAL PRINCIPLES TO BE APPLIED
The University submits they were.
ANALYSIS
A)              College of Medicine Academic Appeals Committee
[9]                  The applicant argues that the Academic Appeals Committee did not investigate the allegations made by the applicant and file a report on the allegations as required by the appeals process.
I am not prepared to accept this argument of the applicant.
The return of the record by the chair of the College of Medicine Academic Appeals Committee shows the Committee obtained all relevant information as it related to the nature of the appeal by the applicant.
It held a hearing on March 31, 2010 at which the applicant, among others, gave evidence regarding previous decisions made.
This part of the application is dismissed.
            The applicant has been successful quashing the decision of the Bylaws Committee and is entitled to some costs.
The amount of the costs awarded is tempered by the fact that there was significant effort and material filed in relation to those portions of the application which were dismissed.
As such, I fix the costs payable by the respondent to the applicant at $500 payable within 30 days.
                                                                                                                               R.C. MILLS ","The applicant was a student at the University of Saskatchewan in the College of Medicine.
He was required to discontinue his studies for failure to meet academic standards for promotion.
The applicant appealed his dismissal and was unsuccessful throughout.
He applied to the Court for an order of certiorari to quash the decision of the Academic Appeals Committee and the University Bylaws Committee Council and an order reinstating him as a student at the College of Medicine pending resolution of his appeal.
HELD: The Court found that the Bylaws Committee Council exceeded its jurisdiction by reviewing the previous decisions made and drawing the conclusion that they were made fairly and properly.
The Bylaw Committee determined the merits of the applicant's appeal and determined that it was not necessary to convene a full appeal board.
There is nothing in the University policy to suggest that the Bylaws Committee has that power.
The Bylaws Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is quashed.
The matter is returned to the Bylaws Committee to determine whether the applicant's appeal falls within the policy on student appeals and academic matters.
The portion of the application requesting reinstatement of the applicant as a student pending the resolution of his appeal is dismissed.
The applicant has a marginal academic record and there are a limited number of placements in the College of Medicine.
It does not make sense to displace another student or require the College of Medicine to train a marginal student on a potentially temporary basis.","[14, 0, 108, 107, 109, 159, 160, 158, 157, 110, 13, 1, 156, 111, 91, 106, 112]"

The fact it was not specifically spelled out in the judgment is not fatal.
The wife having laid out a discounted values for the RRSPs, one would expect the husband to have demanded explicit language in the judgment if he wanted to use unreduced RRSP values to satisfy the equalization payment.
To entertain the husband’s proposition would be to construe the judgment in an unnatural sense in all the circumstances.
34)                  I order that the respondent may satisfy the judgment by way of rollover to the petitioner of $111,617 in RRSPs, representing a discounted value of $83,751.15.
The cash balance required to satisfy the judgment is therefore $21,248.85.
I direct this be done within 14 days.
35)                  The child support issues raised were not in serious dispute.
It was acknowledged a slight adjustment was in order.
I trust the parties can present an order to me on the appropriate terms.
36)                  In light of the mixed success, there will be no order as to costs.
                                                                                                                               Y. Wilkinson   ","The applicant wife sought an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered.
The consent judgment provided that the husband should make an equalization payment of $105,000 to be composed of cash and/or a rollover of retirement funds.
The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax.
Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000.
The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value.
The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application.
The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs.
Therefore, the Court ordered that the judgment be satisfied by way of rollover of RRSPs in the amount of $111,600.","[153, 154, 152, 2, 0, 148, 150, 1, 151, 149, 5, 4, 6, 146, 3, 145, 8, 7, 147, 143]"

He now seeks damages for wrongful dismissal.
         There remains the claim for punitive or aggravated damages.
Collectively referred to as exemplary damages, these are rarely awarded in contract cases where the injured party is essentially entitled to no more than the contract provides.
         Punitive damages are what the phrase implies.
They are intended as an expression of denunciation of the wrongdoer’s conduct and as a form of punishment where there has been no other sanction.
While I think Dignean was treated unfairly, the employer’s conduct toward him was not so outrageous or shocking as to fit this description.
Aggravated damages refer to an enhanced award intended to compensate loss occasioned by some wrongful act independent of the contract.
An example is where the evidence shows wilful, flagrant and extreme conduct by a defendant directly causing the plaintiff to suffer serious mental distress independent of pecuniary loss.
That was not the case here.
For these reasons, the claim for punitive or aggravated damages cannot succeed.
         Mr. Dignean will have his taxable costs of the proceeding including all necessary disbursements reasonably incurred.","The plaintiff was the coordinator of post-secondary education programs for White Bear First Nation, between 1990 until his termination in May 1997.
The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff.
In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs.
There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict.
The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct.
The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment.
The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal.
The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause.
HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed.
The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct.
There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance.
The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract.
Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed.
Although the plaintiff had been treated unfairly, the plaintiff had not shown that the employer was guilty of harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious conduct.","[168, 0, 167, 1, 169, 2, 4, 3, 5, 165, 166, 164, 7, 161, 10, 6, 158, 162, 8, 11, 9, 14, 159]"

It is a distinct courtroom in another province over which this Court has no jurisdiction or control.
[7]                    Second, the Court is very concerned about the possible ramifications of granting such an order as being requested in this matter.
If the Court was to allow this application a dangerous precedent would be set that could potentially result in multiple applications being made in future trials by numerous interested parties throughout the country or indeed the world claiming an inability to attend a court proceeding and asking that they be linked by a live audio/video feed.
The Court has concluded that to grant this application would certainly open pandora’s box to which there would be no control and would not be in the interests of the administration of justice.
[8]                    The Court realizes that the family of Bert Haverkort will be very disappointed with this decision and that indeed is regrettable, however, the Court has the responsibility of ensuring that administration of the trial process is fair and within the rule of law.
The application is thus dismissed.

Making an order for video-conferencing for non- participating persons was not permitted because the Court had no control over the policing of the courtroom in Ontario.

The applicants apply for an order of certiorari to quash that portion of the order of the Labour Relations Board dated the 5th day of January, 1998, which found that the applicants, Loraas Disposal Services Ltd. and Carman Loraas, engaged in an unfair labour practice within the meaning of s. 43 of The Trade Union Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. T-17 by failing to provide the Union and Minister of Labour with notice of technological change.
The Labour Relations Board made a patently unreasonable error in the performance of its function by holding otherwise.
I find that under the circumstances it would not be appropriate at this stage to deal with the application for an injunction.
Rather, I direct that this matter be remitted back to the Labour Relations Board to be dealt with having regard to my finding that the closure of the vacuum division is not a ""technological change"" within the meaning of s. 43(1)(c) of The Trade Union Act. [12]

Richards J.A. (in Chambers)
Timothy P. Ryan for the Appellants
Granted, like all cases, it is grounded in its own facts but this does not necessarily mean it will be of no larger jurisprudential significance.
The issue of delays in litigation is important and this case appears to present some opportunity for this Court to clarify the legal framework relating to such matters.
All of that said, I appreciate there is an arguable irony in a decision granting leave to appeal in a case like this because the appeal itself will cause additional delay.
However, this appeal is not particularly complex and it should be capable of resolution within a reasonably short timeframe.
Having been granted leave to appeal, I expect the Applicants to move the proceedings forward with dispatch.
V.     Conclusion
Leave to appeal is granted.
Costs will be in the discretion of the panel hearing the appeal.
      DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 15th day of March, A.D. 2011.
                                     RICHARDS J.A.","The applicants applied for leave to appeal from a Chambers decision denying their application to dismiss the respondent's claim against them for want of prosecution.
The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan.
The building was substantially completed in 1970.
In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building.
In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss.
In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief.
In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer.
The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997.
Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held.
In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution.
The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant.
HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant.
Secondly, the issue of delays in litigation is important and the case will present an opportunity for the Court to clarify the legal framework pertaining to such matters.","[0, 93, 2, 90, 1, 91, 92, 89, 3, 4, 88, 5, 87, 7, 6, 86, 85, 8, 9, 84]"

The Plaintiff suffers and will continue to suffer from emotional and nervous upset occasioned by his injuries and loss of enjoyment of life.
The Plaintiff claims general damages for past and future loss of enjoyment of life, in an amount to be proven at trial.

ISSUES
The Doctrine of Abuse of Process;
What is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceeding on the subsequent civil proceeding?
The Doctrine of Abuse of Process
[7]            Rule 173 is a codification of the court’s inherent jurisdiction over its own process.
The courts have at various times described the object of Rule 173.
The onus of proving self defence is on the defendant.
He bears the onus of proving the assault was justified and was made with reasonable force.
[16]           In my view the paragraphs of the statement of claim which are at issue in this application do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed.
The plaintiff will have his taxable costs in any event of the cause.
                                                                                                      E. J. Gunn","The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs of the amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of claim to remain would be an abuse of process.
The paragraphs of the amended statement of claim at issue deal with the fact that the plaintiff alleges he was assaulted by the defendant and sustained bodily harm.
The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal.
The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings.
HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed.
1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.
 2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings.
In the civil proceeding, the plaintiff is in a position to control the presentation of his case and must prove his case on a balance of probabilities.

In its submission, if there is a breach of a funding agreement between the Aboriginal Healing Foundation and the Anchorage Counselling Services, that is a matter between those two entities and has nothing to do with the plaintiffs.
In any application to add a party as a defendant, the Court must first decide whether there is a prima facie and meritorious claim disclosed in the amending pleading.
The onus lies on the plaintiffs to establish on the balance of probabilities that they have a reasonable possibility of establishing a claim against the party they seek to add.
They must establish at a minimum the possibility of a cause of action.
I agree with Mr. Justice Chicoine that does not exist here and leave is denied.
Similarly, with respect to the application to add the addendum to the statement of claim, I am of the opinion that Mr. Justice Chicoine made no error in refusing the application to amend the statement of claim.

(b)        the intention of the deceased to revoke, alter or revive a will of the deceased or the testamentary intentions of the deceased embodied in a document other than a will.
                               INTERPRETATION OF SECTION 37
[19]           In Re Balfour Estate (1990), 1990 CanLII 7460 (SK QB), 85 Sask. R. 183 (Sask. Q.B.), Gerein J. noted that the equivalent section in the Manitoba statute had been interpreted in Re Pouliot (1984), 1984 CanLII 3766 (MB QB), 30 Man. R. (2d) 178; 1984 CanLII 3661 (MB QB), 17 E.T.R. 225; Re Briggs (1985), 21 E.T.R. 127; and Kuszak v. Smoley (1986), 1986 CanLII 4996 (MB QB), 46 Man. R. (2d) 14; 23 E.T.R. 237 as giving the court a broad discretion to validate a testamentary document.
However, she did not do so in any manner prescribed by The Wills Act.
Thus, regretfully, it must be concluded that the documents presented as the last will and testament of Helen Pischnot do not meet the statutory requirements for a valid last will.
Consequently, the application must be dismissed, but under the circumstances the applicants shall be entitled to their costs, on a solicitor and client basis, to be approved by me, payable from the estate assets.","The applicants asked for an order setting aside the grant of Letters of Administration and granting Letters Probate with respect to a document purporting to be the Will of the deceased.
The document was a draft Will prepared by the deceased's solicitor, which was never signed.
HELD: The application was dismissed, but the applicants were entitled to their costs on a solicitor and client basis, payable from the estate.
Section 37 of The Wills Act permits the Court to order a document to be fully effective as a Will notwithstanding that it was not executed in compliance with all the formal requirements imposed by the Act.
The discretion granted to the Court does not extend to endorsing a document as testamentary which does not comply with any of the formal requirements of the Act as to execution, and, in particular, a document which does not bear the signature of the deceased.","[0, 83, 63, 12, 1, 82, 64, 81, 62]"
308,"The  applicants seek an order under s.  11  of  The Landlord and Tenant Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. L-6 vesting the whole term  of  their sub-leases with either V.I.P. Business  Centre Inc.  (""VIP"")  or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd. (""Sask.  Ltd."")  on such conditions as the Court deems proper.
Facts [2]        Bennett  Properties  Limited  (""Bennett"")  owns  an office  building  municipally  described  as  Hanselman  Plaza (""the  Plaza"").
By  written agreement Bennett extended the VIP head  lease  to August  31,  1999.
Only a copy of the sub-lease between VIP  and Capital Properties was put in evidence.
Such payments are consistent with the applicants remaining  in possession  under a  month-to-month tenancy following the expiry of  their  sub- lease  in 1997.
Therefore, I conclude the applicants have  not obviated  the requirements of s. 4 by way of part  performance of   their   contractual  obligations  with  VIP  or  Bennett.
Consequently they cannot bind Bennett with the renewal  leases by way of the within summary application.
The applicants  can  obtain  other office space,  including  other space  offered them by Bennett.
Further, should a trial judge find  that the applicants had valid renewal leases which  were enforceable  against  Bennett, general  damages  and  punitive damages would provide an adequate remedy.
In  summary,  the application  is  dismissed.
The parties  may  speak  to costs and whether  they  wish  further directions  regarding  a trial of the issues  raised  but  not adjudicated.                                                             J.","The applicants sought an order under s.11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-lease with either VIP Business Centre (VIP) or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd (SaskLtd).
Bennett, owner of an office building (the Plaza), leased space to VIP for five years ending in 1997.
Issues included (i)whether there had been a valid renewal of the head lease; (ii)whether there had been valid renewals of sub-leases; (iii)assuming valid renewals, did s4 of the Statute of Frauds bar enforcement against Bennett; (iv)whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear an application for relief under s11 brought solely by notice of motion; (v)are the applicants entitled to such relief; (vi)whether Bennett was bound by the sub-leases by virtue of taking the assignment from VIP.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application.
Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits.
2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion.
There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises.
The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry.
Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle.
grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion.
They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre.
The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord.
As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge.
4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages.
The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease.
The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine.
In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically.
The applciants could obtain other office space including that offered by Bennett.
General and punitive damages would provide an adequate remedy.","[143, 141, 142, 138, 2, 137, 140, 4, 7, 136, 1]"

January 29, 2003
[1]               The plaintiff claims that he was physically assaulted and that he lost his traditional aboriginal language and culture approximately 50 years ago, when he was a student at a Residential School.
[2]               The Attorney General of Canada (the “Attorney General”) applies to strike out the plaintiff’s claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes, or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953.
The third party claim is not relevant to this application by the Attorney General to strike out the plaintiff’s statement of claim.
3(3.2)   Subsection (3.1) applies whether or not the person’s right to bring the action was at any time governed by a limitation period pursuant to this Act or any other Act.
The other claims are made directly against the Federal Crown and are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate.
                                                             SUMMARY         
         I will receive written submissions from both parties with respect to costs, to be filed within 30 days.","The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA.
The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School.
The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949.
The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19.
A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application.
HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck.
The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953.
The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively.
The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions.
Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c).
The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability.
3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada).
Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial.
4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii).
As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct.
5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada.
6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate.
The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2).
Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24.
7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate.
SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her. 
LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","[0, 231, 1, 227, 15, 108, 37, 226, 16, 2, 14]"
310,"               QUEEN’S BENCH FOR SASKATCHEWAN
December 8, 2006
The whole of the Agreed Statement with exhibits is incorporated by reference into this judgment.
                                                 ANALYSIS
[17]           Subsections 3(2) and 2(1)(y) of the PPSA define and apply to leases of personal property for a term of more than one year.
They provide as follows:
Subject to section 4 and section 55, this Act applies to a transfer of an account or chattel paper, to a lease for a term of more than one year and to a commercial consignment, that does not secure payment or performance of an obligation.
In this Act:
(y)     “lease for a term of more than one year” includes:
(i)      a lease for an indefinite term, including a lease for an indefinite term that is determinable by one or both of the parties not later than one year after the day of its execution;
The lease in question was therefore “a lease for a term of more than one year” within the meaning of the PPSA and it required registration.
Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry Patchrite’s claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank.
[31]           Orders reflecting this judgment of the Court may issue.
                                                                                              T. C. Zarzeczny","The Bank presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent corporation respecting assets leased by the respondent to Sweeprite.
By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease.
This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act.
HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act.
The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration.
Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank.
1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment.
The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement.
Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent.
Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years.
2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite.
It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way.
3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business.","[11, 62, 117, 61, 118, 116, 0, 115, 63, 64, 65, 66, 17, 67]"
311,"Section  181 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act reads  as follows:          ""(1)
Where,  in  the  opinion  of  the          court,  a receiving order ought not  to          have  been made on an assignment  ought          not  to have been filed, the court  may          by order annul the bankruptcy.""      The  bankrupt`s submission is twofold.
Firstly  that the   bankrupt   received   misinformation   or   had   a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment  on the  status  of  potential  builders`  lien  claimants  and secondly  the  undervaluation of his  assets.
Along  with those  two  grounds  the  bankrupt also  asserts  that  the bankruptcy proceedings are of no value to him.      I  am  not  going to repeat the facts in detail.
The onus will be on the bankrupt to comply with  the requirements  of  the trustee in order to  qualify  for  an automatic discharge.
The  bankrupt  also has the ability to  apply  for  an early discharge before that time as provided for in section 168.1(2)  of  the  Act.
Once  again  the  bankrupt   must cooperate with the trustee in order to ensure that  he  has complied  with  his duties in order to avoid  an  objection being filed by the trustee.
In  the end result the application by the bankrupt for an order annulling his assignment is dismissed.                Registrar in Bankruptcy","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy on the grounds that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and because his assets had been undervalued.
He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants.
The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors.
Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000.
The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy.
The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy.
HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed.
1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment.
It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances.
An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application.
2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate.
The onus will be on the bankrupt to comply with the requirements of the trustee to qualify for an automatic discharge on November 15/98 or an early discharge as provided for in s168.1(2).","[30, 29, 1, 28, 2, 27, 3, 4]"

IN THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH 
ANALYSIS
Subject to the limitations imposed by s. 172(2), there is wide judicial discretion with regard to the type of order which may be imposed on discharge.
The onus is on the objecting creditor to prove the existence of a s. 173 fact if it is not otherwise reported by the trustee.
On this score, the trustee reports Burroughs failed to produce proper records and to assist the trustee to the fullest.
More generally, he reports Burroughs to have been abusive and disrespectful.
Based on the trustee’s information, I conclude that Burroughs was deficient in his duties, consequently the s. 173(1)(o) ground is established as well.
TERMS OF DISCHARGE
Having found justification on several grounds of objection, I am unable to grant Burroughs an absolute discharge by virtue of s. 172(2), and I turn now to the appropriate terms of his discharge.
Burroughs is 42 years of age.
This sum shall be paid at not less than $300 per month, with right of pre-payment.
Upon compliance, an absolute order of discharge shall issue.
       DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 8th day of February, 2010.
Registrar in Bankruptcy","The Bankrupt applies for his discharge from bankruptcy.
The discharge is opposed by the Credit Union and the trustee.
The Bankrupt was a cattle farmer.
He financed this undertaking principally through the Credit Union.
HELD: The Bankrupt will be discharged conditional upon payment of $8,000 in addition to surplus income of $2,250 to his estate for the benefit of his creditors.
He should be able to comply with this order within 3 years.
 1) The bankrupt is 42 years old and a first time bankrupt.
He is employed with an excavating company and earns $20 an hour and works as much as 160 hours per week.
He is paying $1,000 per month on his mortgage and is trying to catch up on mortgage arrears to stave off foreclosure.
He is working hard and living a subsistence life.
However, he still has some funds left with an income level above the Superintendent's Standard for a family of two.
2) His assets are less than $.50 on the dollar.
His creditors were put to the unnecessary expense by his frivolous or vexatious defence of their claim and he failed to comply with the duties of a bankrupt by failing to produce proper records and assist the trustee to the fullest.
He has been abusive and disrespectful throughout.","[0, 218, 2, 180, 181, 217, 179, 216, 99, 182, 177, 178, 215, 100, 102]"

JUDGMENT                              MAURICE J. HERAUF,
July 22, 1999                     Registrar in Bankruptcy
Therefore, there will be an order requiring the bankrupt to pay to the trustee the sum of $18,000.00 for distribution to the unsecured creditors.
The bankrupt shall pay this amount by monthly instalments of $500.00 per month commencing September 1, 1999 and continuing on the 1st of each month thereafter until paid in full.
Judgement interest will accrue on any payment in arrears.
The right of prepayment exists.
Since the bankrupt denies any knowledge of his obligation to make regular instalment payments on his self-employment income I would be remiss if I did not offer the court’s assistance to educate the bankrupt relating to this obligation.
Accordingly, there will also be an order that during the term of the conditional order the bankrupt will be required to make regular instalment payments on his self-employment income and comply with income tax and G.S.T. filing requirements.
The objecting creditor is entitled to costs of $400.00 payable out of the estate.

The trustee calculated surplus income at $435 per month and recommended a conditional order of discharge requiring the payment of $7,800.
Revenue Canada objected, requesting a conditional order for monthly payments of $750 over 4 years.
HELD: Conditional order of discharge granted.
The court found that the bankrupt was 43 years old, in good health and with no dependents.
The bankrupt was also a self-employed contractor with an 'enviable' income.
Following a review of the bankrupt's financial material on file, the court ordered the bankrupt to pay $500 per month for 3 years, to make regular installment payments on his self-employment income and comply with tax filing requirements.","[35, 0, 4, 6, 7, 34, 8, 33, 32, 9, 10, 31, 30, 11, 29, 12, 13, 28]"

I.         FACTS
[1]                  Trevor Wade Meyers stands charged with six separate counts:
She was clear that the threat was to kill her, and was made by the complainant.
The exact dates are established by him.
The defendant had entered into a recognizance February 25, 2011 (Exhibit P-1 in this trial).
            The defendant denied contacting or threatening the complainant on either occasion.
            I do not believe the defendant and do not accept his testimony and denial.
Further, his testimony does not even raise a doubt as to these occurrences.
IV.      CONCLUSION
            I have found the defendant, Trevor Wade Meyers, not guilty of sexual assault but guilty of five charges, being assault causing bodily harm, unlawful confinement, two counts of uttering death threats, and breaching his recognizance.
Again, I have to say that after a careful weighing and assessment of all the evidence, I have no doubt of his guilt of these five charges.
            Counsel may now speak to sentence.
                                                                                                                     R.W. DANYLIUK","The complainant and the accused were in relationship and came to Regina where they stayed in hotel, drank, consumed cocaine and shopped.

At trial, both the complainant and the accused testified as to what transpired during the argument that resulted in the charges.
HELD: 1) The accused was found not guilty of sexual assault.
2) The accused was found guilty of unlawful confinement.
3) The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm.
The Court did not accept the accused's invoking of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code.

                                     IN THE MATTER OF THE PROPOSAL OF
                            W.R.T. EQUIPMENT LTD., AN INSOLVENT PERSON 
    IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION BY THE TRUSTEE OF THE PROPOSAL
It is noteworthy that at present 89 percent of all creditors have reached the same apparent conclusion in voting in favour of acceptance of the Proposal.
            This Court’s obligation under s. 59(2) of the BIA is to consider whether the Proposal is reasonable and calculated to benefit the general body of creditors.
(See Re Stone (1976), 22 C.B.R. (N.S.) 152 (Ont. S.C.); Re Sumner Co. (1984) Ltd. (1987), 64 C.B.R. (N.S.) 218 (N.B.Q.B.); Irving Oil Ltd. v. Noseworthy et al. (1982), 42 C.B.R. (N.S.) 302 (Nfld S.C.)).
            Taking into account all of these interests the Court has concluded, in the circumstances reviewed and for the reasons outlined in this judgment, that the Proposal presented by W.R.T. does meet the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by this Court.
Accordingly the Proposal is accepted and the draft order filed may issue including the amendment to para.
9.1 of the Proposal.
            No costs are awarded for or against any of the parties each of whom shall assume their own costs of representation at the hearing.","The company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by its creditor pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.
A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide.
He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status.
HELD: The Proposal was accepted.
 1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA.
The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims.
Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal.
2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court.
The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation.
Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.
 3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","[66, 65, 0, 64, 1, 63, 3, 4, 2, 59, 5, 7, 58, 62]"

A term of the contract provides that either party can refer any dispute respecting their contractual obligations to arbitration.
A dispute arose between the parties respecting the performance of the contract and both parties agreed to a resolution of the dispute by arbitration.
As none of the bars set out in the Act continue to apply, I am required by s. 50(3) to give judgment enforcing the award.
I decline to award costs to the respondent respecting the enforcement application as it was premature in the circumstances and in any event would not likely  have been required.
Conclusion          The appeal is dismissed and the award is confirmed.
The respondent's application for costs on a solicitor and client basis is denied.
Failing agreement between the parties, the appellant shall pay the respondent's taxed costs on this appeal on a party and party basis.
The respondent's application for enforcement of the award is granted without costs.                                                             J.","The contract for the construction of a spur rail line to the grain terminal provided that either party could refer any contract dispute to arbitration.
The Arbitrator's award favoured the A &amp; E Rail Contractor's position.
Leave to appeal had been granted.
At issue was were whether the arbitrator applied the correct measure of damages and whether there was any evidence to support the findings of fact.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed.
The respondent's application for enforcement of the award was granted without costs.
1)The issues were questions of fact not law.
The errors complained of were the same questions referred to the arbitrator for determination.
Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law.
The wording on the second issue was changed slightly to read 'in his calculation as to damages awarded for increased costs of winter construction'.
There was some evidence upon which the arbitrator could make a finding of fact.
2)As none of the bars set out in the Act applied the court was required by s50(3) to give judgment enforcing the award.
 3)The application for costs on a solicitor and client basis was denied.
Failing agreement between the parties, the appellant would pay the respondent's taxed costs on the appeal on a party and party basis.","[77, 76, 75, 74, 3, 73, 72, 4, 2, 1]"

 [5]                These changes of circumstances involve an application to vary and cannot be dealt with as a result of the decision of the Court of Appeal referring the matter back to me on the issue set forth.
 [6]                In addition, Mr. Collins advises that he intends to challenge the legislation dealing with custody and access.
He was unaware that he is required to serve the notice under The Constitutional Questions Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. C-29 and as such was not in a position to argue that issue before me.
 [7]                In the end the parties agreed that they were not able to bring all of these issues before me and both sides have agreed that this application before me should be abandoned in favour of proceeding with an application to vary which would encompass all of the issues which have arisen since my decision of July 9, 1999.
 [8]                I am of like mind.
Therefore the parties may proceed by way of an application to vary and the issue raised by the decision of the Court of Appeal will be subsumed in that application.
 [9]                In view of this nothing further need be done by me and no costs are awarded to either party on this issue before me.","The Court of Appeal remitted the issue of custody to the trial judge on April 13, 2000 but the matter was adjourned for various reasons.
The parties had brought numerous applications since the July 9, 1999 decision and they had been in a pre-trial.
HELD: An application was to be brought which would encompass all of the new issues.
There had been numerous changes in circumstances which went beyond the single issue referred back.
The petitioner intends to challenge the legislation dealing with custody and access but was unaware he is required to serve notice under the Constitutional Questions Act.","[0, 34, 1, 2, 33, 32, 3, 4, 5, 29, 30, 6, 28, 31]"
319,"SIGNIFICANCE OF VESTED OR CONTINGENT CONSTRUCTION
In general, a future interest is vested when there is no condition precedent to its taking effect in possession other than the termination of prior estates, however and whenever that may occur; but if there is such a condition precedent, then the interest is contingent.
Sometimes the terms contingent and vested refer to the question whether or not there is a condition of survivorship; but that terminology is not employed here.
In determining whether an interest is vested or contingent, it is necessary to ascertain what language creates a condition precedent, and what does not.
That is the subject of this chapter. [bolding in original]
Doubtless the concept of a vested interest goes back to feudal notions of the vested remainder in land.
This interest was subject to no condition precedent other than the termination of prior estates.
This statement of the law is confirmed in Ziff Principles of Property Law (1993)  at p. 174:
S.C.R. 550; Fasken v. Fasken, 1953 CanLII 9 (SCC), [1953]
2 S.C.R. 10; Re Ganong Estate, 1940 CanLII 56 (SCC), [1941]
See:  Haggerty v. City of Oakland, (1st Dist.) 161 Cal. App. 2d 407. 
See:  61 Am Jur 2d, pg. 62, para.","The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease.
In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959.
The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993.
After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner.
The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence.
HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V.
The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench.
1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule.
The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive.
The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society.
The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times.
Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae.
Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule.
Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.
 2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease.
The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed.
The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general.
The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property.
A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough.
The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision.
The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease.
As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971.
The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future.
The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.","[1045, 683, 682, 686, 681, 690, 1044, 1040, 1041, 680, 684, 685]"

It is certainly open to them to proceed with this arrangement without the formality of a judgment or contract.
Another option is to reduce their understanding to writing, even if there is no lawyer prepared to sign a certificate of independent advice for obvious reasons.
However, today the parties have come to the Court requesting the proposed form of consent judgment.
It is here that the Court must take its stance.
[6]               When, upon the evidence filed, the terms of a consent judgment appear to be patently unfair or unconscionable to one of the parties, it is my opinion that the Court must refuse the application.
The Court must not been seen to legitimatize, condone, acquiesce nor approve of an unconscionable bargain.
[7]               Ms. Perra would clearly benefit from legal advice and guidance, but no one can force her to seek such help or assistance.
Counsel for the petitioner tried as best he could to urge upon Ms. Perra her right and need for such guidance and he cannot be faulted.
[8]               The application is dismissed.
In the circumstances, no costs are awarded.","The Court was presented with a consent judgment.
The respondent was unrepresented.
The Court found the terms of the consent judgment were so unfair as to be unconscionable.

The court was required to review the information available to the officer to determine if there was sufficient information to justify the swearing of the information on reasonable and probable grounds.
             It should also be noted that the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan decisions as recent as March 2013 have chosen to follow the authorities and rationale as set forth herein rather than the decisions in R. v. Toulejour and R. v. Fontaine.

             This court does allow the appeal for the reasons set forth herein and does direct that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.

The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act.
The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail.
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment.
In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA).
The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole.
The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence.
Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012.
At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention.
These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan.
The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code.
The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012.
The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application.
The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour.
Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA.
HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed.
The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply.
Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent.
The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA.
The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","[258, 2, 257, 1, 259, 255, 251, 0, 254, 3, 5, 250, 253, 9, 256]"

In this case the trial judge found that the sword had a blunt edge.
Combined with the evidence that it is a decorative item, she determined that it was not designed for use as a weapon.
The Crown argues that the learned trial judge ignored evidence that the sword also had a tip.
However, I disagree that this one factor should have led her to find the sword was designed to be used as a weapon.
I agree with the learned trial judge when she suggested that the “sword in question is not in the category of brass knuckles, firearms or switch blades, which are weapons”.
[21]           The learned trial judge was required to address s. 2 of the Criminal Code with respect to the definition of a weapon.
There was evidence upon which she could conclude that the Crown had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to use the sword as a weapon, or that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon.
Accordingly, the Crown’s appeal is dismissed.
                                                                            J. E. McMURTRY","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon.
The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants.
At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge.
The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television.
The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon.
The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence.
HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience.
No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge.
The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store.
On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon.
The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed.
The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon.

FACTS
[2]                                      No hearing was conducted, but the facts were agreed to by counsel.
The learned trial judge erred in law in finding that the Information should be dismissed for an abuse of process as no abuse of process at law had occurred in these circumstances.
REVIEW
Loss of Jurisdiction
[8]                                       The Crown position is that the special plea of autrefois acquit cannot be maintained because the respondent was never in jeopardy in Alberta.
The Saskatchewan court did not lose jurisdiction over the offence(s) when nothing happened on March 5, 2001, and the subsequent appearance on May 7, 2001, (within three months) regained any lost jurisdiction over the person.
The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.
See R. v. Keyowski, 1988 CanLII 74 (SCC), [1988]
This is one of those “clearest of cases” that justifies a stay.
CONCLUSION
The informations sworn on March 1, 2001, and March 29, 2001, in this proceeding are stayed.","The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08.
The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law.
Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months.
Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges.
At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law.
HELD: The Informations were stayed.
The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction.
1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution.
Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis).
The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001.
A summons was not issued until August.
The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3).
'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'.
It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court.
Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location.
The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first.
3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta.
The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001.
The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3).
There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken.
The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances.
4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process.
The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress.
The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice.
The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","[0, 127, 121, 1, 34, 13, 120, 119, 14, 53, 118, 54, 55, 56, 15]"

The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the Respondent, Norbert F. Knoedler (“Mr. Knoedler”) on June 4, 2009, in Provincial Court on a charge that on or about October 27, 2007, at Esterhazy District , in the Province of Saskatchewan, having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood, he did operate a motor vehicle, contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code and on a charge that on the same date and at the same place, while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol, he did operate a motor vehicle, contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255 of the Criminal Code.
DISPOSITION
The authority for the bringing of this appeal against conviction to this Court is found in ss. 812(1)(d) and 813(b)(i) of the Criminal Code. Section 822(1) states that where an appeal is taken under s. 813 in respect of a conviction, ss. 683 to 689 apply, subject to certain exceptions which are inapplicable here.
The relevant portions of s. 686(4) provide for the following in the case of a successful Crown appeal against acquittal:
I will remain seized with this matter until sentencing has occurred.
In the event that a sentencing hearing has not been held or commenced within 90 days, a bench warrant will issue for the arrest of Mr. Knoedler in order to compel his attendance before this Court.

The Crown alleged that the trial judge erred in law by excluding two breath samples taken following the respondent's arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights.
During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence.
HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered.
The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter.
The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand.
The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts.

That a restitution order pursuant to section 738 in the amount of $8,518 be paid directly to Mr. Hal Schmidt, c/o Family Pizza, Bay #10, 318 - 105th Street, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, S7N 1Z3.
That the six month conditional sentence is affirmed with the conditions as originally ordered with an additional condition:
He shall pay restitution to Mr. Hal Schmidt, c/o Family Pizza, Bay #10, 318 - 105th Street, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, S7N 1Z3 at the rate of at least $200 per month commencing June 1, 1997.
That the period of probation is decreased to three years following the expiration of the six month conditional sentence.
The terms of the probation order are affirmed save and except condition 7 which is amended to read:
Pay Restitution in the amount of $8,518 directly to Mr. Hal Schmidt, c/o Family Pizza, Bay #10, 318 - 105th Street, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, S7N 1Z3 at the rate of at least $200 per month commencing in December 1, 1997 until the full amount is paid.","The Crown appealed the six month conditional sentence with 45 months probation and a restitution order for the offence of stealing money in excess of $5,000 contrary to s334(a).
HELD: The appeal was allowed and the following ordered: a restitution order payable directly to the employer in the amount of $8,528; the six month conditional sentence was affirmed with the conditions as originally ordered plus restitution was to be paid in full at a rate of $200 per month; the period of probation was decreased to three years following the expiration of the six month conditional sentence.

In Concurrence:  The Honourable Mr. Justice Richards
There was, with respect, no evidence to support this conclusion and the evidence was to the contrary—that Mr. Jobb was able to recount the facts of his offences.
This was evidence in Dr. Obikoya’s report as well as in the passages from Dr. Menzies’ testimony referred to above.
The conclusion, in any case, that Mr. Jobb did not have the ability to testify as to the facts of the charges against him is contrary to the evidence of Dr. Menzies.
See, again, transcript p. 28, l. 11 and following.
It is my conclusion that the appeal must be allowed, the verdict of unfitness to stand trial set aside and that there be a new trial on the offences which are the subject of this appeal.
      DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 3rd day of December, A.D. 2008.

                              for   HUNTER J.A.","The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial.
The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions.
He was also charged with two indictable thefts.
He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse.
He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment.
He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board.
The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea.
The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel.
The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered.
The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code.
The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test.
The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness.
This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes.
Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests.
The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","[307, 306, 0, 3, 305, 304, 300, 299, 303, 4, 7, 301, 296, 2, 1, 6, 297, 5, 8, 15, 302]"

RESPONDENT
The Honourable Mr. Justice Cameron
The Honourable Mr. Justice Sherstobitoff
The Honourable Mr. Justice Lane
He has a Grade 12 education and was pursuing a secondary education at the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College.
Indeed, his only excuse for the drug deal was that he needed the money from ""peddling dope"" to pursue his education and to meet the needs of his children.
He said the robbery was unpremeditated and occurred only because the money he paid for the drugs was a very large sum to him, and the robbery was necessary to recoup the money because the drugs were bad.
The Crown appeal must be allowed for two reasons.
Second, given the record of the appellant, particularly in respect of armed robbery and weapons offences, these offences demanded a sentence of more than the three year minimum generally imposed for such offences.
Taking all of these factors into account, and even allowing some discount for the fact that the robbery occurred during the course of an illegal drug transaction, the sentences for each offence should be increased to three years imprisonment, the sentences to be served concurrently.
There will be an order accordingly.","The Crown appealed two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently for armed robbery.
The 32 year old appellant had 32 previous convictions including two armed robberies and seven convictions relating to possession of weapons.
HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed and the sentence for each offence was increased to three years imprisonment to be served concurrently.
1)The judge made an error in calculating the time on remand that should have been credited to the sentence.
Only six months rather than the whole year should have been counted.
2)Given the appellant's record these offences demanded more than the three year minimum generally imposed.","[52, 0, 1, 2, 51, 50, 3, 48, 4, 5, 6, 47, 7, 46, 8, 45]"

[2]            The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived.
The appeal is made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Code.
Section 737 states:
Subject to subsection (5), an offender who is convicted or discharged under section 730 of an offence under this Act or the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act shall pay a victim surcharge, in addition to any other punishment imposed on the offender.
Subject to subsection (3), the amount of the victim surcharge in respect of an offence is
(a)  15 per cent of any fine that is imposed on the offender for the offence; or 
(b)  if no fine is imposed on the offender for the offence,
All amounts paid by way of victim surcharges are used in accordance with s. 21 of the Victims of Crime Act, 1995, S.S. 1995, c. V-6.011.
In the result, the sentence is varied to include an order requiring the Respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30.00.
The Respondent shall have 30 days to pay the victim surcharge calculated from the day he is served with a copy of this decision.

If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharge, it is also mandatory that the Court give reasons.

D.N.A. Warrant Applications
Any subsequent application with respect to the within matters must include a reference to the present applications having been made, and to this judgment.
In light of the novel nature of these applications, I propose to make this judgment available to the Chief Judge’s office for publication, in the usual fashion.
No application for a sealing order has been made, and I do not presently perceive any possibility that publication will adversely impact on any ongoing investigation or otherwise compromise a source.
(The same may not be true with respect to the contents of the three Informations in Support, the contents of which will not be disclosed or made public except pursuant to s. 487.3 of the Code.)
If the RCMP or the reviewing prosecutor consider that publication of this judgment should be delayed, the Court clerk should be so notified not later than 5 p.m. on March 15, 2002 so that the matter of publication may be addressed further.
Dated at Melfort, Saskatchewan on March 7, 2002.
Judge of the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan","The Crown applied for three DNA warrants pursuant to s.487.05 of the Criminal Code.
Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result.
The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155.
The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation.
'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable.
Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed.
Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a).
2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations.
The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable.
There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking.
The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out.
The paragraphing format was confusing.
3)A DNA warrant application would be premature.
The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood.
It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained.
It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","[3, 4, 5, 0, 6, 119, 116, 117, 118, 8, 114, 115, 113]"

October 6, 1994                         INTRODUCTION             On June 1, 1994, the accused (hereafter the appellant) was charged in an Information that he, on or about the 29th day of May, A.D. 1994, at Red Earth, in the Province of Saskatchewan, did commit an assault on Janet Head contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.             On June 1, 1994, the appellant appeared before a judge of the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan.
. . . . .                               (emphasis added)             As will be observed from a detailed examination of said s. 100(1) of said the Criminal Code, supra, before its provisions can be invoked there must exist two pre-conditions: FIRST:the offender must be convicted of an indictable offence in the commission of which violence against a person is used;                     - and - SECONDLY:on said conviction the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for ten years or more.             In the particular circumstances, as the requisite two pre-conditions did not exist, the Provincial Court judge erred in making the noted s. 100(1) prohibition order.             On September 29, 1994, the appeal against said prohibition order was allowed and it was set aside.                              ________________________________J.","The Crown elected to proceed summarily and the accused entered a plea of guilty to a charge of assault under S.266 of the Code.
He was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment, 18 months probation and a 10 year fire arm prohibition was imposed.
He appealed his sentence.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
1)Because the accused had no related record and given the circumstances of the assault,
the sentence of imprisonment was reduced to time already served (15 days).
2)The trial judge erred in imposing the 10 year fire arm prohibition under S.100 of the Code. S.100 requires a conviction on an indictable offence involving violence against a person where the maximum sentence available is 10 years imprisonment or more.
3)The maximum sentence for assault under S.266 is 5 years if the Crown proceeds by indictment and 6 months if, as here, the Crown proceeds summarily.","[13, 0]"
331,"Evidence of Dr. Greg Stevens[33] 
I found Dr. Stevens to be an excellent and knowledgeable witness who was completely independent.
Accordingly, within his area of expertise, where his opinion differs from that of the other experts, I accept his evidence.
Where his evidence confirms that of one of the other experts, it gives greater weight to that opinion.
Dr. Stevens made it clear in his evidence that he was not in a position to comment on the likelihood of success of any treatment programs which might be devised for Mr. [F.R.] as this was outside his area of expertise.
Although I was not provided with the materials given to Dr. Stevens about Mr. [F.R.]’s previous offences, I received an assurance by the Crown that the materials would be corrected to remove the improper information about his previous sexual offences.[34]
Dr. Stevens administered two personality tests, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2)[35] and the Self-Regulation Skills Interview (SRSI).

2 S.C.R. 309; 37 C.C.C. (3d) 1; 61 C.R. (3d) 1, at paragraph 44.","The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender.
There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code.
It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met.
The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender.
This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel.
HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender.
He is sentenced to indeterminate detention.
1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000.
While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour.
2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.
 3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances.
4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person.
Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face.
Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time.
It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk.
5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","[500, 639, 638, 501, 636, 637, 502, 503, 634, 633, 504, 631, 505, 506]"

RESPONDENT
This is an extremely frightening occurrence in a community, and this type of conduct and  level of violence is utterly appalling.
[7       The sentence of 2½ years imposed by the trial judge did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that the sentence be proportionate to the gravity of the offence.
Nor did the sentence achieve the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature.
[8       The sentence of Mr. Key was increased by this Court to the equivalent of more than ten years imprisonment.
The following factors mandate a lesser sentence for Ms. Thorne: (a) she had no criminal record; (b) she did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of Prodanovic and Kulas, and intervened to stop the beating of Prodanovic, albeit only after she seemed satisfied that he had nothing to give the robbers; and (c) she seems to be doing well in all programs in prison.
[9       Taking all of these factors into account, it is our view that a fit sentence is five years imprisonment.
The sentence imposed by the trial judge is set aside, and a sentence of five years imprisonment is imposed in lieu thereof.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence of 2.5 years for manslaughter on the grounds it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of deterrence and denunciation.
HELD: A sentence of 5 years of imprisonment was imposed.
The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature.
The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent.
The accused pled guilty, had no criminal record, did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victim who died from the wounds or of the other victim; she intervened to stop the beating although only after being satisfied the alleged the drug dealer had nothing to give the robbers.
 The accused appeared to be doing well in the prison programs.
The sentence of the co-accused who had a record of 40 previous convictions had been increased to the equivalent of more than 10 years imprisonment.","[1, 56, 55, 2, 3, 4, 53, 52, 5, 51, 6, 7, 54, 50]"

In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician.
HELD: The accused was found guilty.
There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving.
1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident.
2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate.
There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying.
The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient.
His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory.
There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples.
The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient.
3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required.
4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay.
The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.

Sherstobitoff, Richards & Smith JJ.A.
Lyle O. Phillips for the Appellant
The other side of the coin is that the trial judge did not accept his evidence that Ms. Little intended that the funds in question benefit the grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
Furthermore, the appellant knew from the outset that the respondents disagreed with the position taken by him and intended to take proceedings against him.
In the circumstances, the appellant’s actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the court were imprudent for a trustee, notwithstanding that he made the distribution upon legal advice that he was entitled to do so.
The circumstances simply do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee’s imprudence.
The appeal is dismissed with costs under Double Column V in the usual way.
      DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this  14th day of October, A.D. 2005.

                                     SMITH  J.A.","The deceased made a Will appointing her only son, the appellant, as executor.
In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents.
The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly.
She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000.
After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself.
He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will.
The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him.
He appeals against that judgment.
HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.
 1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2)
The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust.
The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren.
She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact.
Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate.
In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust.
In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis.
Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate.
3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF.
The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error.
The judge made no such error.
 4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren.
The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased.
The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him.
The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee.
The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence","[156, 0, 155, 154, 151, 152, 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, 153, 8, 148, 7, 150, 6, 9, 147]"

[1]                  The applicant, by way of notice of motion seeks the following relief:
            The Board’s decision suggests that the phrase “where the Board considers that the claim for compensation is fair and just” in s. 47 of the Act is subject to two possible interpretations: 
(a)       The justice of waiving the six month limitation period involves an examination of the reasons for the delay.
(b)       Do the substantive merits of the claim lead to a conclusion that the claim should be allowed in spite of the delay?
            In considering the first of these potential interpretations, the Board does not appear to consider the full impact of the fact that the applicant was unaware of her right to apply for such benefits.
The Act in fact mandates that an employer is required to report injuries which may prevent an employee from working.
Conclusion
            The applicant shall have her costs of the motion, on a party and party basis, to be taxed.
            Order accordingly.","The deceased was a master's student who also worked as a student assistant at the University of Saskatchewan.
He became ill while teaching a class.
His students helped him to the faculty lounge.
He was found in the faculty washroom unconscious and not breathing approximately 30 minutes later.
Emergency medical technicians were not able to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead at the Royal University Hospital.
An application for dependants' benefits was submitted over 3 years later.
The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim.
The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674.
HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979.
The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption.
2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant.
3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing.
4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.","[3, 310, 309, 4, 1, 0, 299, 306, 2, 301, 296, 295, 7, 13, 5, 298, 15]"

[5]            To balance the rights and interests of the two young persons, the plaintiffs and the public, portions of the affidavits of the young persons must be sealed as follows:
the affidavit of JR:
–          paragraphs 9-13 inclusive;
–          Exhibit “B” thereto, depicting physical injuries; and
–          Exhibit “D” thereto, victim impact statement of HR.

                                                 ANALYSIS
This judgment announced an “adjustment” to the traditional approach to be taken when deciding whether a claim should be dismissed for want of prosecution.
The traditional approach was as determined by this Court’s decision in the case of Carey v. Twohig, 1973 CanLII 898 (SK QB), [1973]
In the Carey case, Bayda J. (as he then was) determined the following approach to be followed when deciding whether or not an application to dismiss a claim for want of prosecution should succeed.
He concluded the defendant must show:
I have reached the same conclusion with respect to the present case.
Accordingly, the case is ready to and can proceed to trial without further delay and it should do so.
[40]           The context in which the delay in this case occurred is straight forward.
It does appear that neither party has undertaken extensive communications with the other although McDiarmid bears greater fault in this area than does counsel for, and his client, Ochapowace.
Nevertheless, the 2007 “warning” was not acted upon in a timely fashion.
                                              CONCLUSION
If the parties disagree respecting costs, the same are referred for assessment by the Local Registrar.
                                                                                           T. C. ZARZECZNY","The defendant applied for dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution.
The claim was issued November 1, 1999 and is based in debt for goods and services provided to the defendant.
The value of the claim is $521,283.99 and refers to provision of materials, products and services in 1995 and 1996.
The statement of defence was filed November 12, 1999 and amended in 2002.
In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary.
A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48.
In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases.
The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided.
Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference.
There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case.
The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short.
While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance.
Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial.
The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action.
The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied.","[12, 0, 160, 173, 67, 65, 11, 156, 172, 1, 158, 155, 157, 68, 69, 70, 153]"

It does not speak to the discretion of the trial judge to determine how the two actions should proceed.
          I am not satisfied that this draft order provides for these trials to be conducted in a manner that best achieves the goals of judicial economy and justice that are the underpinning for joinder of actions.
The order in which the trials are conducted, the use of evidence from one action in the other, and any other matters that must be addressed are better left for determination by the trial judge.
I accordingly order as follows:
1.            Darius Tsatsi v. Tony Merchant, being Q.B.G.1607 of 2009, and Darius Tsatsi v. College of Physicians and Surgeons et al., being Q.B.1008 of 2011, shall be tried one immediately after the other, in the manner determined by the trial judge.
2.            The defendant has leave to amend his Statement of Defence in Q.B.G. 1607 of 2009 by adding the following paragraph:
3A      Such words as were spoken or written by the Defendant are true, and the Defendant asserts that the alleged defamation was justified in law.
          Costs of this application shall be in the cause in Q.B.G. 1607 of 2009.","The defendant applied pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 169 for leave to amend his Statement of Defence.
This is a defamation action and the amendment would add that the words spoken by the defendant were true and that the alleged defamation was justified in law.
The action relates to statements made about the plaintiff's failure to properly read an X-ray and his failure to pass certain certification exams and that health officials knew that he should not be performing the work he was doing.
There is another defamation action, described in this judgment as the College Action.
The defendant applied pursuant to Rule 41(2) that his action and the College Action be tried together because there are common issues of fact between the two, albeit different actions.
 Trying them together would be in the interests of judicial economy and avoid the possibility of conflicting findings.
HELD: The Court ordered that the two actions be tried one immediately after the other in the manner determined by the trial judge and that the defendant be given leave to amend his Statement of Defence.","[61, 60, 0, 59, 1, 2, 4, 57, 3, 56, 54, 5, 55, 58]"

Having regard for the standard of review applicable to this appeal, we can find no tenable basis for interfering with the order made in the Court of Queen's Bench.

[6]            At the trial of this matter both Mr. Lawson and Mr. McKay testified.
In addition, Mr. Young and Mr. Borbely testified.
                                              THE EVIDENCE
In total, Mr. McKay says the amount required to fix the installation work of Mr. Lawson, was the sum of $2,720.42.
                                                 ANALYSIS
The issue before me is whether Mr. McKay is liable to pay Mr. Lawson’s outstanding account.
Mr. McKay’s concerns are with respect to the installation of the soffit, facia and eavestroughing and no evidence was led to indicate the products used in the installation were defective.
Mr. McKay cannot be said to have decided to proceed with additional work or to have work done of a higher quality than the work expected to be performed by Mr. Lawson.
I am, therefore, setting off the damages as against Mr. Lawson’s claim.
                                              CONCLUSION
                                                                                                    D. L. Wilson","The defendant contracted with the plaintiff for supply and installation of materials.
The defendant was not satisfied with the plaintiff's work, hired a third party to fix the plaintiff's work and refused to pay the plaintiff.

HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed.
The Court found enough evidence to conclude that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that there was a breach of the implied condition that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard.
As the plaintiff's workmanship constitutes a breach of contract, the defendant's damages are set off against the claim.","[33, 136, 140, 0, 32, 1, 2, 31, 30, 3, 29, 4, 135, 70, 5, 134, 71, 28, 34, 72, 73]"

            On these facts therefore it could be argued, in my view with some success, that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota.
The authorities I have quoted support that approach.
            The question here however is otherwise.
The question is whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in the state of Minnesota.
On the dicta of Rand J. and Estey J. in Thomson, supra, the question must be answered in the negative.
So also on an analysis of s. 3 of The Foreign Judgments Act.  Subsection 3(a) uses the term “ordinarily resident” while subsection 3(b) uses the term “carrying on business”.
The case law I have reviewed convinces me there is a real difference in the meaning of these terms and that the Act reflects that difference.
While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion that the defendant was ordinarily resident there.
            Because the defendant was not ordinarily resident in Minnesota when the action was commenced the second factor, the time question raised in subsection 3(a) needs no further explication.
            For these reasons the plaintiff’s action is dismissed with costs to be taxed.","The defendant manufactured solarium in Saskatoon which it sold to the plaintiffs in Minnesota.
The plaintiffs alleged the solarium was defective, sued and obtained judgment in the Minnesota Court which it now sought to enforce in Saskatchewan.
The defendant argued the Minnesota court did not have jurisdiction because at the time the action was commenced he was not 'ordinarily resident' in the state of Minnesota.
The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction.
HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed.
1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act.
2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there.
The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product.
The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address.
It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state.
The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'.","[87, 86, 0, 1, 85, 84, 2, 83, 4, 3, 82, 81, 5, 7, 80, 79, 78]"

That is a possible interpretation, but I do not have to deal with the issue given my analysis of the applicability of the merger agreement on the question of relevance.
Malone J. considered the same arbitration clause.
The arguments advanced were not the same as those put forward by the plaintiff in this action.
It appears the argument pressed strongly was that the partnership agreement could no longer apply as the plaintiff was no longer a member of the partnership.
Malone J. dismissed that argument, stating that the claim was based solely on the validity of the partnership agreement.
That claim was not reproduced.
However, the plaintiff here seems to have based his claim totally on the partnership agreement.
There are no other provisions in s. 8(2) that apply to this situation that may result in a refusal to stay the proceedings.
Therefore, the action is stayed pursuant to s. 8(1) of The Arbitration Act, 1992, supra, with costs to the applicant.
The draft order filed by the applicant may issue.

The plaintiff is chartered accountant who was partner with the defendant.
2000 merger agreement signed by the plaintiff indicated that the Courts of Saskatchewan would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine all disputes between the parties.
After the merger, the plaintiff signed new partnership agreement that said arbitration would apply to any disputes between partner and the partnership.
HELD: The action was stayed pending arbitration.
The plaintiff's statement of claim does not rely on the 2000 merger agreement, the claim is based solely on the new partnership agreement and alleges breaches of the partnership agreement.
The partnership agreement clearly states that disputes are to be resolved through arbitration.","[74, 0, 75, 73, 1, 72, 71, 2, 4, 3, 70, 69, 68, 5, 67, 7, 6, 8, 9, 65, 10, 63]"

- and -
            The evidence establishes the defendant was illegally trafficking in 100 cords of firewood.
The fact that the transaction never was completed is irrelevant.
The offence was complete by the making of the offer.
The clear intention of the defendant was to avoid the $15.00 per cord levy the Province would have imposed.
            Of even greater significance in the sentencing process than the actual levies sought to be avoided is the need to deter not only the defendant but other offenders from flouting the law.
Accordingly, a fine equivalent to a levy avoided would be inappropriately low since the fine could not in those circumstances act as a deterrent to either the defendant or other offenders.
Accordingly, the defendant shall pay a fine of $5,000.
The defendant shall also pay a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations, 1997, R.R.S. c. V-6.011 Reg. 1.
The defendant shall have 60 days to pay the fine and victim surcharge imposed, and in default of payment shall serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.
                                                                                                                        B. SCHERMAN","The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act.
He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third.
He appealed his conviction.
He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge.
The Crown appealed the sentence.
The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking.
The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant.
He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land.
He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative.
If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit.
The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land.
The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted.
The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant.
The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending.
With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer.
The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands.
HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent.
It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise.
The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven.
However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality.
Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence.
The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products.
Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act.
The conviction was upheld.
Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders.
The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low.
The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations.
If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","[253, 255, 0, 1, 3, 256, 2, 5, 250, 247, 245, 251, 248, 246, 6, 254]"

The Act defines “employer” to mean: “a person, firm, association or body that has,
in connection with the operation of a place of employment, one or more workers in the service
of the person, firm, association or body.”(s. 2(i)) 
not in the service of an employer.”
“Worker” is defined as: “a person who is engaged in an occupation in the service of an
The Act does not define “due diligence” but well-established case authority simply defines
this as taking reasonable care to avoid causing a harm which is prohibited by law.
Had he done 
this there at least would have been proper safety measures taken at the worksite so that even
with these inexperienced workers doing the job their safety could easily have been ensured by taking 
the simple and common sense steps mandated by the law embodied in the Act and Regulations
that govern workplace health and safety ( for example, properly sloping the trench).
Mr. Peterson violated the law by his failure to take any reasonable precautions to prevent
death or injury to the workers whom he was responsible for on the worksite in St. George’s Hill.
Mr. Pederson is therefore guilty as charged on all offences.
Dated at the Town of Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan the 27th of September, 1999.","The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations.
It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability.
The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances.
The essential facts were not in dispute.
HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.
 1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met.
This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site.
Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available.
Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced.
The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching.
No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision.
The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups.
2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible.
There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor.
The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship.
The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","[82, 85, 220, 84, 218, 222, 221, 87, 223, 83, 217, 219, 88, 215, 216, 89, 90]"

March 28, 1995          This is an application by Christopher Paul Reid and Canada Truck Lease Ltd. (the ""defendants"") for an order pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction severing the issues of liability and damages.          The grounds that were argued in connection with the application are as follows: (a)      A determination of the issue of liability in favour of the defendants will render a determination of the issue of damages unnecessary; (b)      given the quantum of damages claimed by the plaintiffs and the volume of evidence necessary to prove this aspect of the claim, the prior determination of the issue of liability may result in a very significant reduction in trial time and costs; (c)      the evidence to be heard with respect to each issue is easily segregated, and a prior determination of the issue of liability will not require a repetition of the evidence on that point; (d)      the plaintiffs' position as to the quantum of damages claimed will not be prejudiced by a prior determination of the point of liability; (e)      a severance of the issues will not result in any significant delay in the overall management of the action.                              FACTS          This action arises out of a tragic motor vehicle accident which occurred in the City of Saskatoon, on September 20, 1991.
This has not been established in this case.

The trial was to be held before a jury.HELD: 1)The Court has a general discretion as to severance of issues which must be exercised judicially. 2)Severance should only be ordered when the judge has a serious reason to believe that the trial of the issue proposed to be severed will put an end to the action. 3)The Court accepted the Plaintiff's submission that expert medical evidence would be necessary to establish the cause of the accident since the Plaintiff had suffered brain damage and would be unable to testify.
This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found.
4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages.
A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues.
5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case.","[51, 50, 1]"
346,"PROVINCIAL COURT OF SASKATCHEWAN
IN THE MATTER OF
JUDGMENT                                                                                                   T.W. Ferris, PCJ
Doubtless those who enacted the law may have felt that citizens might be more concerned to see the laws upheld than non-citizens, and thus do not agree with the holding of the court as to whether it was justifiable.
But, at the end of the day, the law did discriminate against an identifiable group on the basis of legal characteristics.
Thus, in my view, Sec. 15 has not been violated and no stay of the proceedings should be granted on the view that it has been.
It is true that the defendants here have gone to great trouble and expense to press their view that it is not fair to prosecute them unless everyone else is prosecuted.
However, it does not follow that just because they have been selected form a pool of possible defendants, that it is “appropriate and just” that the proceedings should be stopped.
Whether the proceedings should be stopped cannot turn on how zealously one defends himself.
It must turn on how “just” it is that proceedings be stopped.
That is not to be seen only through the eyes of the defendant.
T.W. Ferris, Provincial Court Judge","The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay.
They contended the bylaws were inapplicable.
They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter.
Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province.
This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983.
Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners.
Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal.
In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983.
The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197.
The province had no policing mechanism for violations.
The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title.
In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve.
They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot.
Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department.
This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw.
On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure.
Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility.
Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities.
In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves.
Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments.
They received no response and issued an order.
Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking.
Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves.
On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP.
The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution.
The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act.
On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils.
Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992.
On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991.
The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not.
On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action.
Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes.
Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use.
The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted.
Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion.
If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court.
If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense.
Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private.
The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter.
HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197.
Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval.
The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority.
The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land.
Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve.
It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution.
The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter.
How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197.
John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197.
The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction.
If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies.
An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective.
The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility.
It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times.
If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators.
This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use.
They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act.
The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter.
Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations.
To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit.
A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law.
They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position.
Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances.
The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out.
There was no such evidence.
Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski).
The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution.
In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'.
In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'.
Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'.
The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'.
The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation.
The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators.
The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners.
Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it.
The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides.
The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action.
The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed.
Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants.
Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council.
The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid.
The delay by the province occurred pre-charge.
There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process.
Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination.
It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles.
It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.
 'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted.
Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15.
The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews).
This case should not be read so broadly.
In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","[561, 564, 555, 560, 558, 559, 0, 2, 9, 551, 550, 557]"

The defendants in this instance had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants.
The certified cheque did not satisfy a just debt.
The defendants had already received payment for their services.
[14]          Finlayson J.A. found that the irrevocable nature of a certified cheque and the liability of a bank to the holder of a certified cheque, which it certified at the request of the drawer or holder had the advantage of bringing a certified cheque squarely within the framework of the Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-4 and codified the consequences of certification.
In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of the payee is maintained while providing recourse to a bank where a payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the ""irrevocable nature"" of a certified cheque.
[15]          The defendants motion must be dismissed as the plaintiff's statement of claim adequately discloses a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.

Tri-Link issued a replacement cheque.

Default judgments were obtained in January/March 1997 against the defendants who now sought to have them set aside pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 346 and 173(a).
The defendants claimed the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action as a certified cheque is irrevocable and as such any default judgment may be set aside ex debito justitiae, in which case delay in bringing the application is not factor.

He was served with the notice of the application, and the notice of the trial.
                               THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES
      [T.K.] wants [C.S.] to be returned to her care.
                                                 ANALYSIS
As follows:
In child protection hearings it is a two step process.
[117]            Even with all of these issues, [T.K.] says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children.
I accept that she will do this, however, I find myself sympathetic to [T.K.]’s disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser.
I expect that the success of the involvement of DCR in the life of this family would be enhanced with the assignment of another worker.
Ms. Fraser may feel that her personal involvement with this family has not impeded her ability to work with this family.
This is not a view shared by [T.K.], and it has worked to [T.K.]’s detriment.
                                                   ORDERS
[118]            I find that [J.S.] is in need of protection and that he shall be placed with [S.K.] for an indefinite period.
[K.S.] will attend any sessions at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR.   
                                                                                                      E. J. Gunn","The Department of Community Resources (DCR) seeks orders pursuant to The Child and Family Services Act (the Act) placing CS with the Department until age 18 pursuant to s. 37(2) and JS with his grandmother as a Person of Sufficient Interest pursuant to s. 37(1)(b).
With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday.
This order was granted at trial.
The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care.
HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period.
JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court.
This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits.
CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months.
During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return.
TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program.
KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR.
1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony.
2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR.
Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent.
During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs.
The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act.
3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time.
KS has quit drinking.
TK is now employed.
KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction.
The parents have a residence.
TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health.
DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time.
TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children.
The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser.
The success of the involvement of DCR in the life of this family would be enhanced with the assignment of another worker.","[629, 628, 642, 533, 5, 532, 0, 2, 627, 535, 626, 536, 624, 3, 641, 4, 630, 514, 19, 625]"

March 23, 1994          The Director of the Labour Standards Branch of the Department of Labour issued a certificate pursuant to s. 60 of The Labour Standards Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. L-1 (the ""Act""), stating that the City of Regina (the ""City"") owed its transit employee, Albert Morgan, $511.08 in wages.
He further admits that the agreement's provisions governing pay for holidays are more favourable than the comparable provisions in the Act.          I have no difficulty therefore in concluding that in the circumstances of this case the provisions of the agreement are more favourable to Morgan than the terms of the Act.
That being the case, in light of the Caxton, supra, decision, the provisions of the agreement should govern, and not those of the Act.          The City's application is allowed, and the certificate is amended to show that there are no wages due or owing to Albert Morgan.          There will be no order as to costs.                                                             J.","The Director of Labour Standards issued a certificate against the City of Regina certifying that it owed a transit employee $318.41 in wages for hours worked in weeks containing a statutory holiday in excess of 32 hours as provided in the Labour Standards Act.

HELD: The City's application was allowed.
Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question.
Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act.","[24, 0, 23]"

 [42]               No costs are awarded.","The divorce action was based on separation for more than a year.
 In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property.
HELD: 1)Divorce was granted.
The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998.
2)They agreed to joint custody of both children.
The son was to reside primarily with his father.
The daughter resided with her mother.
Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends.
The children were to be together most weekends.
School vacations would be shared.
3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance.
Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense.
The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance.
4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003.
The mother's job advancement was impeded as a result of the marriage, specifically by frequent moves to accommodate her husband's job transfers.
She had worked out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing.
5)The parties agreed the matrimonial home would be sold and proceeds divided equally after payment of expenses of the sale.
Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale.
The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.
 6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage.
It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000.
The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded.
The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000.
All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition.
RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover.
7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner.
The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75.

The mother takes the position that the children are not “children in need of protection” pursuant to s. 11 of the Act and that the children should be immediately returned to her care.
If, however, I determine that the children are children in need of protection, the mother proposes that I make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother’s care under supervision and conditions.
2.            If so, what is the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act?
                                                    LAW AND ANALYSIS
[131]            It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process.
[152]            The Ministry must continue to work with the mother with regards to the mother’s ongoing contact with the children.
I would like to see the mother have a visit with Katie and Hannah at the Saccucci’s home.
I would also encourage the Ministry to consider access for the mother with the three children, at the home of the mother on an unsupervised basis, at some point in the future.
Hannah, in particular, requires more contact with her brother.
                                           CONCLUSIONS AND ORDERS
Again, I encourage the mother to proceed with the recommended therapy immediately.
                                                                                                                              D. L. Wilson","The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006.
The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years.
The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care.
In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions.
The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act.
HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act.
There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years.
There shall also be an order with respect to access.
It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process.
First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11.
If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children.
The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them.
The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA.
They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children.
The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands.
The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result.
If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act.
The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs.
The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children.
Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive.
Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act.
The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection.
Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care.
Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion.
Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home.
The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities.
Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change.
She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it.
For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act.
The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years.
The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act.
All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother.
However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements.
In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor.
The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old.
There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years.
The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act.
Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives.
An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case.
The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.","[0, 749, 760, 1, 622, 19, 748, 621, 746, 20, 759, 745, 24, 743]"

In the context of conflicting evidence regarding the children’s wishes, it is open to the Chambers judge to decline to make a finding on the issue and to proceed to base the decision on other factors.
We can find no error in the approach taken by the Chambers judge to her analysis of the best interests of the children.
Conclusion
There is no material error, or misapprehension of the evidence, or error of law by the Chambers judge in proceeding on the evidence she had before her and in her determination of the children’s best interests and her crafting of a suitable order.
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below.
The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant.
For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances.
No error was made on this issue.
The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz.
The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting.
She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests.
There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them.
The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children.

The issue was not plead in defence, although the parties did canvass the circumstances within the framework of this summary trial, albeit without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference.
It would be unjust to make any further order under the Act in these circumstances and in the absence of evidentiary basis, for example, of the fair market value of the sprayer at the time of the seizure as required for an order under s. 55(c) of the Act.
         Only if the Agreement is a lease and is not covered by The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, would I hold that Case Credit is not barred by implied acceptance of Mr. Poirier's condition that he be released from further liability, because of exclusionary clause eight of the Agreement.
I must follow the principles enunciated in Société Generale (Canada) v. Gulf Canada Resources Ltd., 1995 ABCA 259 (CanLII), [1995]
In that event, I would grant judgment to the plaintiff for $42,089.00 with costs on the basis of Column 3 of Schedule I of the Tariff of Costs.
         The plaintiff's claim is dismissed.
The defendant is awarded costs on the basis of Column 3 of Schedule I of the Tariff of Costs.","The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer.
The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act.
HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3.
1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment.
The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale.
Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party.
Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used.
The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law.
The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer.
He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours.
The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract.
The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment.
He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability.
Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent.
To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors.
Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55.
It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure.
5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause.
Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","[76, 75, 74, 0, 1, 73, 2, 3, 4, 72, 70, 5, 71]"

                                                                DISCUSSION
 [8]                At the time of the agreement, Howard earned $48,000.00.
By 1993, the first year in which he was required to pay a total of $4,200.00 his income was only 42% of his 1992 income.
However, he actually paid a little in excess of his required payment that year.
Sandra does not dispute the income earned or the payments made during the relevant years.
 [10]               In all of the circumstances there will be an order eliminating the arrears of payment from January 12, 1993 to the present.
There will also be an order terminating any ongoing obligation for support based on Sandra's representations to the court and her letter to the Alberta Maintenance Enforcement Office. ","The father applied to vary the Alberta order by extinguishing his maintenance arrears from January 1993 to the present and for an order eliminating any further obligation to pay child support.
The parties married in 1974 and divorced in 1992.
They agreed to joint custody of their two children in their 1991 separation agreement.
One child was expected to graduate in 2002 and the other in 2003.
The father said he suffered depression and was unemployed for several years.
HELD: Arrears from 1993 were eliminated.
He paid 39, 9 and 0% of the required support in 1994, 1995 and 1996 when his income dropped.
He paid 5% in 1997, 66 in 1998 and 117% in 1999.
Any ongoing obligation was terminated in view of the mother's letter to the Alberta Maintenance Enforcement Office and her representations to the court that she was no longer seeking support.","[0, 13, 1, 35, 36, 14, 50, 2, 12, 49, 48, 37, 15, 34, 11, 38]"

Mr. Richard A. Mayer for the Appellant
Written submission filed by the Respondent with no one appearing
Appeal Heard:                  June 10, 2002
Appeal Decided:               June 17, 2002
Written Reasons:              June 17, 2002
The appellant must recognize, and counsel assures us he now does, that he must obtain employment when his health allows.
In these unfortunate circumstances it is clear the arrears are not likely to ever be paid in full and we order them reduced to $5,000.
Enforcement of the order below is stayed so long as the appellant continues to make the payment of $30 a month to Maintenance Enforcement.
When his employment situation is known, it is, as suggested by his counsel, open to the parties to negotiate a resolution of the matter or he can make an application to finally decide the matters of arrears and support.
The appeal is therefore allowed to this extent.
There will be no order as to costs.

Given that overarching purpose it is only logical that orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property.
Such orders can involve third parties being required to take certain steps if they are inextricably linked to the property being preserved.
[14]           In short, it is not offensive to direct that the respondent’s counsel, at the time of such settlement, if there is such settlement, pay monies into Court.
Such an order does not impact the rights of the respondent’s counsel but merely imposes a clerical task which is a natural incident to the preservation of the asset in debate.
[15]           Accordingly, it is ordered that in the event the respondent receives a settlement in his law suit against the Government based on his claim of abuse suffered at the Indian Residential School, the first $50,000.00, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court so that the parties might speak to the distribution of same.
It is further ordered that the respondent’s counsel, the Merchant Law Group or any new counsel shall pay the settlement proceeds into Court, in accordance with the foregoing.
[16]           The petitioner shall have her costs of this application which I set at $350.00.","The father was unemployed by reason of health problems and was in arrears on the December 13, 2002 child support order for $454 per month.
He was seeking damages against the federal government for alleged abuses suffered while attending an Indian Residential School.
The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support.
HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel.
The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known.
There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8.
It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money.
To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8.
Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property.
The mother was awarded costs of the application set at $350.","[49, 0, 48, 1, 46, 2, 3, 45, 47, 4, 44, 43]"

The Honourable Mr. Justice Sherstobitoff 
THE COURT
In this action brought by the respondent/plaintiff on a hail insurance contract for the 1996 crop year, the appellant, McQueen Agencies Ltd., appeals from an order entered in Queen’s Bench on October 15, 1998.
This order dismissed the appellant’s motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim for insurance premiums payable by the plaintiff under the hail
insurance contract in question.
The appellant’s motion for dismissal of the plaintiff’s action was also denied.
Although the appellant contends that the plaintiff’s claim is fixed at $3,373.50, being the amount of an appraisal award, the respondent/plaintiff challenges the validity of this appraisal award purporting to be made under The Saskatchewan Insurance Act and the statutory conditions that govern such appraisals.[1]
[7]         Leave is also granted to each party to re-open the examinations for discovery for the purpose of examining on the new issues raised by any such amendments.
In giving these directions we are not to be taken as passing on the admissibility of evidence or other legal issues pertaining to the matters raised in the amended pleadings.
Since such matters are for the trial judge, it would be premature for this court to make any further comment.
DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan,  this 16th  day of February 1999.
See appeal book page 96a, paragraph [8], of the reasons of chambers              judge’s reasons.
See appeal book page 90a","The insurer appealed the October 1998 order which dismissed the appellant's motion for dismissal of the insured's action and for summary judgment on its counterclaim for insurance premiums payable under the hail insurance contract.
The insured had signed a promissory note and tendered a cheque payable in September 1996 but stopped payment and advanced a claim of set-off.
HELD: The appeal was allowed in part under Rule 129 without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to proceed for the alleged loss of $38,585.
1)The appellant was granted leave to amend its statement of defence by pleading the relevant statutory conditions in the Saskatchewan Insurance Act and any additional material facts and new matters raised by the amended statement of claim.
The plaintiff was granted leave to reply.
Each party was permitted to re-open the examinations for discovery.
2)The insured had no defence to the counterclaim for premiums which was a separate action.
The prayer for relief was amended to claim the full amount of the premiums which were payable with interest at the rate of 10% as stipulated in the promissory note together with costs on the applicable tariff in Queen's Bench and in the Court of Appeal on single column 5.","[10, 34, 33, 11, 12, 32, 31, 13, 14, 9, 30, 1, 29, 15]"

SASKATCHEWAN VALLEY CREDIT UNION LIMITED
APPELLANT (Respondent)
- and - 
ROBERT LANSON and SHARON SEVERSON
RESPONDENTS (Applicants)
Mr. D. Layh for the appellant 
In this case the trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing.
It follows that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer, Spruce Meadow Trucking Ltd.,  free from the secured interest.
It follows the Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and that the Credit Union therefore has priority over the security interest of Lanson and that Lanson’s rights against Nickle are restricted to the proceeds.
In light of this finding it is also not necessary for us to deal with the claim for priority of the Credit Union based on s.30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993.
By declining to deal with this matter we are not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge.
The appellant shall have costs in the usual way on double Column V.
[2](1984) 1984 CanLII 2337 (SK QB), 35 Sask. R. 166 (Q.B.) approved in (Sask. C.A.) 1985 CanLII 2883 (SK CA), [1987]","The issue on appeal was reduced to whether the security holder, Lanson, authorized Nickel to sell the mobile home as contemplated by s28(1) or, if not authorized, did he sell the mobile home in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s30(2).
Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home.
The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full.
Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson.
The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds.
Lanson attempted to seize the home.
The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.
 HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet.
The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security.
2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization.
Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral.
The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full.
3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale.
Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale.
The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.
 4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds.
There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party.
5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing.
It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer.
The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.
 6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","[77, 1, 0, 76, 3, 75, 2, 78, 4, 72, 5, 6, 7, 71, 73]"

[1]                 Further to the hearing of this matter on May 7, 2013, the issue remaining to be determined is whether the children are to be, on an interim basis, relocated from La Ronge to live with the respondent at Melville, Saskatchewan. 
The respondent further advised that she was enrolling the children in school at Melville.
ANALYSIS
I am also satisfied that there is no risk for the children in the care of either the petitioner or the respondent.
CONCLUSION
[8]                  I find on the evidence that the parties are to be joint custodial parents for the two boys.
I find the preservation of the status quo is in the best interest of  the two boys.
            The petitioner has been successful in this application.
I have considered the fact that the respondent unilaterally relocated the children resulting in the petitioner having to bring two applications for the return of the children to their home in La Ronge, Saskatchewan.
I assess costs against the respondent in the amount of $1500 payable within ten (10) days from the date of this judgment.
                                                                                                                            R. D. MAHER","The issue to be determined was whether the parties' children should remain in La Ronge or be relocated to live with the respondent in Melville on an interim basis.
The parties were in a common law relationship and had two children, aged 9 and 12.
After separation, the children resided with their mother, the respondent, in La Ronge and they had access with the petitioner on the weekends.
In January 2011, the parties agreed to a weekly co-parenting arrangement.
In April 2013 the petitioner was advised by the respondent that she and the children had moved to Melville.
Up until that point the child had always resided in the La Ronge area and attended only one school.
HELD: The Court found the co-parenting arrangement to be the de facto parenting arrangement and that there was no risk to the children with either parent.
The Court ordered that the parties were joint custodians of the children and that preservation of the status quo was in their best interests.
The Court ordered that the children primarily reside in La Ronge with the petitioner and attend school there.
The Court also ordered specified access for the respondent.","[0, 62, 12, 84, 63, 1, 83, 13, 61, 64, 82, 26, 56, 11, 2, 81]"
360,"The garnishee summons served on the Sherwood Credit Union on June 22, 1994 did not bind any debt due or accruing due from the garnishee to the association.
The term deposits were non redeemable and could not be withdrawn at anytime prior to their maturity date on June 29, 1994.
The garnishee attached nothing.
The debt must be either presently payable or presently due though payable at a future date.
I am aware that in some jurisdictions, Ontario being one, the applicable rules have been changed to specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.
This leads me to believe that this area of the law may well benefit from a review of The Attachment of Debts Act.
It may be that the result I have reached no longer adequately serves the business community especially since commercial paper of this nature is now much more prevalent then it was when the earlier decisions I have relied upon were decided.
In the result, while it is clear I am not endorsing the reasons of the chamber judge, I concur in the result he reached and the appeal is therefore dismissed with costs on double Column V.
Dated at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan,  this  17th day of October, A.D. 1996.
WAKELING J.A.","The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.
The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David.
First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity.
When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate.
Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application.
The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.
 1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable.
3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.
 4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable.
The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due.
Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas.
The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment.
Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due.
5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose.
It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances.
DISSENT:
The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date.
The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation.
There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.","[271, 272, 339, 341, 274, 337, 273, 340, 338, 336]"

Daniel Dahl                                                                                                        for the Crown
Donald MacKinnon                                                                                       for the accused
The admissibility of that evidence can be reserved by the court, pending the determination of the Charter issue on its merits, and the application of a s. 24 remedy, if any.
One of the advantages of having the Crown evidence put on the record at the outset of the trial is that it eliminates any guesswork as to the nature and quality of that testimony as it relates to the Charter application.
This surely is superior from a procedural standpoint than the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire on speculation, discovering that aspects of that evidence are unfavourable and contrary, and therefore having to attempt to convince the trial judge to grant leave to cross-examine the witness.
It also avoids the possible scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the Charter voir dire, and then the accused having to impeach the credibility of that same witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues.
I must therefore conclude that the fairness of these proceedings, as well as the public confidence in the administration of justice, are best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge as alleged, with the accused having leave to apply to have the evidence applied to the Charter issue, if it is appropriate to do so.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application.
This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition.
In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process.
This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter.
In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue.
The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire.
The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure.
If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues.
The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy.
An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application.
This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine.
It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues.
The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","[54, 55, 3, 52, 4, 5, 51, 53]"

(4th) 448.","The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support.
Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act.
The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.
 1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship.
The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship.
The relationship deteriorated in 2006.
It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain.
However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally.
The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records.
The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him.
The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters.
Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication.
2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father.
His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship.
The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way.
The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother.
This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally.
The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","[241, 239, 3, 0, 2, 237, 236, 238, 4, 1, 7, 6, 5, 240, 235, 233, 8, 9, 232, 10, 231, 11, 12, 230, 234, 224, 13, 228, 229, 225, 14, 15]"

The issues in this case began long before the notice of termination of tenancy (which ultimately prompted this Court's involvement) and stem from a number of complaints made by both the tenants and the landlord.
The tenancy was not an amicable one.
On this basis some deference must be shown to those aspects of the rentalsman's decisions which reflect an exercise of discretion.
In the result, the appeal is allowed and the decision of the rentalsman restored.
As neither the landlord nor the tenant was represented by counsel, there will be no order as to costs.","The landlord applied for possession of residential premises after his tenants refused to vacate in response to a written notice to vacate.
The deputy rentalsman ordered that the landlord should have possession, but also ordered that the last two months rent would abate in order to assist the tenants with their moving costs.
The landlord appealed the abatement of rent and a chambers judge reversed the deputy rentalsman.
The tenants sought and were granted leave to appeal the chambers judge and this appeal resulted.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
1)The chambers judge could only reverse the deputy rentalsman if he exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law.
2)The deputy rentalsman had jurisdiction to order an abatement of rent pursuant to S.47(4) of the Act.
3)The jurisdiction is a discretionary one.
The court will therefore show some deference to a decision of the rentalsman involving this jurisdiction.
In this case the deputy rentalsman made no reversible error.","[1, 89, 88, 87, 3, 0]"

RESPONDENTS
Mr. Neil Robertson for the Appellant
(2)        Did the Committee err in law in ruling that the assessed value cannot be increased where the board orders correction of errors in the assessment?
[4       We are of the view that the answer to all three of these questions is no.
On the facts of the case, the Committee was correct in concluding that the Board had no jurisdiction to make the order which it did.
It then, as an appellate entity, was asked to affirm what was, in essence, a nullity.
This it could not do.
While its procedure was flawed to some extent in that it did not specifically raise the vires issue so as permit the City to make argument on it, its conclusion in this respect was correct.
The issue of vires in the body below was open to it and indeed necessary to it to consider its conclusion in this regard.
[5       Having given these answers, the appeal of the City, in essence, stands dismissed and the respondent taxpayer will have its costs in the ususal way on double Column V.","The landowner appealed an assessment for taxation purposes to the City Board of Revision alleging it was too high.
No cross-appeal was filed by the City but the Board increased the assessment.
The City then appealed to the Saskatchewan Municipal Board Assessment Appeals Committee to ask for a further increase.
There was no-cross appeal by the owner.
The Committee concluded the Board erred, having no jurisdiction to make an increase, and restored the original value.
Leave to appeal was granted with respect to whether the Committee erred in making an order respecting issues not raised by the notice of intention to appeal; in ruling the assessed value cannot be increased where the board orders correction of errors in the assessment; if not, whether the Committee erred in jurisdiction in failing to apply s.263.2 of the Urban Municipality Act.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double column V to the respondent.
The Committee was correct in concluding the Board had no jurisdiction to make the order.
It was asked to affirm what was in essence a nullity.","[1, 2, 34, 35, 3, 4, 33, 32, 5, 31, 6, 30, 7, 29, 8, 9, 27]"

In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury.
Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery.
HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence.
Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery.
In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery.

Dr. Maher Hanna appearing for himself
But there is no evidence that Pipestone District formally approved the system or was party to it.
Not to be omitted from the consideration is the impact brought to bear upon that relationship by the College of Physicians and Surgeons for Saskatchewan.
A hospital is never, at least on the facts here, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors.
 [26]                  The relationship between the Moosomin Union Hospital or Pipestone District Health was not compromised by the arrangement entered into by the doctors to deliver on-call services.
Nor was that relationship one governed by the rules governing trustees or fiduciaries.
 [27]                  There is no basis either in fact or in law supporting the existence of a trust or a fiduciary relationship between Hanna and the defendant Pipestone District Health.
 [28]                  For the foregoing reasons I dismiss Hanna's action against Crouse and Kirsch with costs to be taxed.
And I also dismiss Hanna's action against Pipestone District with costs to be taxed.","The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board.
Under the voluntary arrangement doctors who chose not to enter the arrangement remained on-call to look after their own patients and to respond to emergencies.
It worked well until Hanna established another clinic and began dividing his time between Regina and the Moosomin clinic.
HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.
 1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct.
When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him.
Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital.
He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence.
He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days.
Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition.
His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors.
The on-call arrangement was voluntary.
There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood.
There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.
 4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District.
Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons.
A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors.
There was no basis in law or fact supporting the existence of a fiduciary relationship between Hanna and the Health District.","[0, 88, 1, 87, 2, 85, 86, 3, 4, 83, 84, 5, 82, 6, 7, 8, 80, 9]"

November 3, 1997          The Minister of Social Services has applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. H.B. is the mother of the child, R.J.B., Jr., born January 5, 1995, and is alleged to be of ""unsound mind"".
The child was apprehended at birth and is currently the subject of a child protection hearing.
In support of his application the Minister relies on The Public Trustee Act, S.S. 1983, c. P- 43.1 as amended, and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.          The application is opposed by the Public Trustee who takes the position ""that it is not the appropriate party to act as the litigation guardian on behalf of H.B."" and that ""The Public Trustee Act does not give the Public Trustee the jurisdiction to represent an adult under mental disability in cases other than where a property interest is involved"".          The relevant sections of The Public Trustee Act are the following:   32(1)
In this regard I have ordered an assessment pursuant to s. 32 of The Child and Family Services Act, S.S. 1989-90, c. C-7.2.
An order will issue accordingly unless the Public Trustee, within 10 days from the date of this order, shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party to so act.
       There shall be no order as to costs.                                                             J.","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. who was alleged to be of unsound mind.
H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing.
The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself.
An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act.
The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order.
1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved.
Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult.
The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings.
2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected.
If the court failed to intervene H.B. will be left in limbo, a victim of the system.","[36, 37, 35, 0, 1, 2]"

Prospective Respondents
In making an order pursuant to subsection (1) or (3), the court may:
(a)   impose any terms and conditions that the court considers appropriate; and
This provision is worded very broadly.
The transition period provided for in the order is one that was recommended by the psychological report and is manifestly in the best interest of the child, who has been in the care of his foster mother since birth.
It is in my view highly doubtful that the Act should be interpreted, as counsel for the proposed appellant argues, to preclude an order returning the child to its parent’s custody with a period of transition.
In any case, even if there is a scintilla of merit to the argument, I would not grant leave on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on this extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case.
Nor am I satisfied that the issue is of sufficient significance either to the parties or the wider public to warrant an appeal.
The application is dismissed.","The Minister of Social Services applied for leave to appeal an order of Gabrielson J., sitting on appeal from an order of Meekma P.C.J. in relation to the child K.W.
Gabrielson J. made an order returning K.W. to its parent's custody with a period of transition after receiving a psychological report on R.S.
The report was very favourable to R.S. The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report.

January 15, 1999 
The children were born:
Lj, […], 1993 and 
There has been testimony that adoption of all three children by one family is possible.
I accept the evidence that the children need and deserve the stability that this could provide.
I agree with the recommendation for permanent committal.
I have no authority to attach any conditions to the order.
I should comment, however, that the testimony makes it clear that regardless of their deficiencies and inadequacies C and L love their children.
There has always been some contact through visits even though, particularly in the case of L, it has been sporadic at times.
There has been testimony that during visitation the interaction between the parents and the children may not be just what others think it should be but it is clear from the testimony that the affection and love are there.
I mention this for whatever assistance it may be should consideration be given to an open adoption if such appears possible.","The Minister of Social Services sought an order under s.37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act to permanently commit all three children to the Minister.
The Department of Social Services had been involved with the family since the birth of the oldest child.
The children had been in the care of the Minister at various times and parent aides provided help to the parents when there was child or children at home.
The Minister called 18 witnesses.
HELD: All three children were committed permanently to the Minister.
1)The mother appeared to be more anxious about excusing the father, who was an abusive alcoholic, than about protecting the children.
The mother was unable to parent any of the children on her own.
It was concluded under s.11(b) of the Act that there was no adult person able and willing to provide for the children's needs and physical or emotional harm may come to the children if it had not already.
2)The father had recently pleaded guilty to sexual assault on an eight year old girl which could, depending on the facts be a ground under s.11(a)(iii) of the Act for a finding of need for protection.","[2, 5, 6, 138, 0, 7, 137, 8, 135, 136, 10, 9, 134, 133, 11, 132, 131, 14, 13]"
370,"IN THE PROVINCIAL COURT OF SASKATCHEWAN
[12]           The Ministry presented ten witnesses at trial, including one expert witness.
By consent a report of Francis Stewart, who was also qualified as an expert, was admitted as evidence.
Following is a list of the witnesses and summary of their evidence:
Ms. Ansell apprehended April 20, 2010 when T.J.E.S. was one day old.
Ansell observed T.J.E.S. with the mother in the hospital and at supervised visits.
M.S. handled the child well, but breast feeding was a struggle.
M.S. pumped and froze breast milk to feed the baby on visitation days.
M.S. was willing to participate in parenting and anger management.
I have considered the factors enumerated in section 4, in light of the evidence.
[85]           I have found that there was no basis for the initial apprehension.
The “best interests of the child” is an important factor in all orders.
I am satisfied I have jurisdiction to order the return be done following a transition period.
This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry.
T.J.E.S. is to be completely returned to the mother, M.S., within 30 days of this order.
P.K., the father, is not living with the mother and requested only access.
       M.T. Gordon, J","The Ministry brought an application for a permanent order for the child pursuant to s. 37 of The Child and Family Services Act.
The Minister apprehended the child at birth.
The mother's three older children had been apprehended with two other older children placed with a person of sufficient interest and the third child was made a permanent ward of the Ministry.
The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child.
The mother and the child's father had separated with the father supporting the mother having the child returned to her care and the father having access to the child.
HELD: There was no basis for the initial apprehension as the child was not in need of protection.
The child shall be returned to the mother who is a person who has a right of custody of the child pursuant to s. 36(3) of the Child and Family Services Act.
This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry with the child to be completely returned to the mother within 30 days of this order.
There was no evidence presented at trial regarding attempts by the Ministry to pursue any less intrusive alternatives and instead proceeded directly to the most severe position being a permanent order.
The evidence did not justify the Ministry's position.","[664, 666, 660, 134, 133, 129, 128, 127, 663, 662, 0, 139, 137, 658, 656, 135, 661]"

                                                                   THE LAW
         Section 11 of the Act defines when a child is in need of protection.
For the purposes of this matter, s. 11(a)(i), (ii), (v) and (vi) are germane.
Given the objective of the Act as set out in s. 3, a permanent committal does not ipso facto follow just because the parent has not yet turned that new leaf.

Ottenbreit","The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old.
DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born.
Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007.
Both children have been in care for most of their lives.
The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children.
The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care.
HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society.
Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement.
2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management.
The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH.
The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour.
There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future.
There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past.
The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal.
There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past.
The Court finds that the relationship is unstable.
The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship.
The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control.
There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic.
This should not be visited on the children.
HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS.
The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court.
This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3)
If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm.
While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS.
The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours.
The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so.
The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH.
4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order.
A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time.
The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","[451, 502, 452, 501, 0, 453, 3, 500, 450, 454, 376, 377, 378, 499]"
372,"No other corollary relief was set out in the divorce judgment.
The father is a dentist practicing in Melfort, and was so at the time of the divorce.
Mother was then without employment.
History of the Proceedings in F.L.D.:             The parties married August 23, 1980 and separated in September 1988.
They entered into a separation agreement in December of 1988 in which they agreed to joint custody, residence with the father and generous access to the mother.
However, no objection was taken by the applicant to father's affidavit on that account and I presume this was not an issue.
Once a second stable union has been established the new spouses or the new family unit must be allowed to live a normal family life.
Mother will have access during the months of July and August, the entire Christmas holiday of two weeks starting Christmas 1995, the entire Easter holiday starting Easter of 1996, the entire mid-term break (usually in February).

The Father now intended, however, to move with the children to Ontario to take additional education.
HELD: Application dismissed.
1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed.
She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children.
3)In the circumstances of this case the Judge was convinced that the move was reasonable and was not motivated by any desire on the part of the Father to thwart the Mother's access.","[1, 130, 129, 2, 3, 126, 4, 128, 5, 124]"

 [11]               If I had determined that the court has jurisdiction for purposes of making a custody order under the Act, I would decline to exercise it, pursuant to s. 16 of the Act, since it is more appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in British Columbia.

July 11, 2012
Background
1)                     The parents of two young boys, nine and 11, require a framework for parenting.
The father, Jake, has had primary residence by interim order but that arrangement has been fraught with difficulty for reasons which will be explored.
The two households are within blocks of each other and, in an ideal situation, the children could have transitioned easily between homes.
This has not occurred and the mother, Sherri, asks that the boys’ principal residence be varied, and awarded to her.
114)                 The parents indicated they were dividing the summer of 2012 equally, and did not anticipate any difficulties on that score.
In the interests of completeness, there will be an order that the summer holidays are to be shared equally between the parents.
The father’s income is $21,736 (non‑taxable).
Each will notify the other within 30 days in the event of any change in their employment status or sources of income.
116)                 There will be no order as to costs.

Wilkinson   ","The parties agree that joint custody is appropriate, but the petitioner mother asked that the principal residence of the two boys be varied and awarded to her.
The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well.
The children have been primarily residing with the father.
The father has been in three motor vehicle accidents within three years and is facing criminal charges as a result of the most recent one.
The father works long hours as a maintenance man.
The mother has four other children from previous relationships.
The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home.
The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education.
One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care.
While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home.
The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort.
The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way.
HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall.
The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father.
Joint custody was ordered.

The parents cannot resolve this decision and defer to the court to determine where Madison’s primary residence shall be and thus in which city she shall attend school.
                                                         THE EVIDENCE
The Petitioner’s Case
[2]                 Kelly is 27 years old.
He met Lisa in 2007 and they were married on April 4, 2008.
Lisa was pregnant with Madison at that point in time and delivered Madison on September 2, 2008.
Madison was and continues to be a healthy child.
Only her uncle had any criticism of Madison.
The Custody Access Assessment
The reported evidence parallels the testimony given at trial in most respects.
          The parental attributes of each of Lisa and Kelly are described by Mr. Jensen as follows:
Assets of Lisa as a Parent
Lisa has consistently reached out for appropriate community support services.

SANDOMIRSKY","The parties had a shared parenting arrangement since separation where each party parented their four-year-old child for equal times in a two-week cycle, the petitioner parenting in her home in Moose Jaw and the respondent parenting in his parent's home in Regina.
The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school.
Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent.
The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application.
The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents.
The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child.
The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make.
HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child.
The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent.
The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents.
The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's.
Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan.
The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain.
The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina.
The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime.
The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend.
The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays.
The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two.
The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year.
Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.
Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days.
The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement.","[12, 481, 0, 483, 13, 206, 480, 23, 26, 477, 24, 29, 207, 28, 212, 25, 423, 471, 205, 27, 201, 31, 1]"

DECISION
[9]               I am not persuaded on this review that it is in the best interests of the children to change the interim access order made last August, either by restricting access or by enlarging it.
         Costs of $1,500.00 are awarded to the petitioner, payable no later than May 31, 2011.
                                                                                                   G.M. KRAUS","The parties had obtained an interim order in August 2010 and applied to vary the order pertaining to access and child support.
HELD: 1) The Court declined to vary the interim access order and ordered the matter to trial.
2) The respondent is intentionally under-employed and the Court imputed annual income to him of $130,294 and child support was varied accordingly.
Section 7 childcare expenses are to be shared pro rata.
3) The Court declined to order interim spousal support as the Court was not satisfied that the respondent had the existing ability to pay it.
4) The issues regarding retroactive child support, ongoing child support, access and spousal support were directed to pre-trial conference.
5) Costs of $1,500 were awarded to the petitioner and payable no later than May 31, 2011.","[0, 52, 1, 51, 75, 94, 50, 2, 3, 76, 4, 48, 93, 5, 49]"

That is undue hardship.
42)                  Now the respondent seeks to extinguish the arrears because he wants to prepare for his retirement.
It is repugnant to even suggest reducing the arrears.
Conclusion
43)                  I order as follows:
The respondent’s application to reduce or expunge child support arrears is dismissed.
As of April 30, 2013, the respondent’s arrears under the orders of Madam Justice Wilkinson dated March 7, 2001 and July 20, 1998 are fixed at $183,746.
The children Mandala and Bogani are no longer children of the marriage.
The child Thabani remains a child of the marriage.
    Commencing June 1, 2013 and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter until further order of the Court, the respondent shall pay basic child support in the amount of $927 per month.
44)                  Given that the petitioner was self represented, there shall be no order as to costs.
                                                                                                                               G. D. Dufour ","The parties had three children during their marriage.
After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000.
The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it.
She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support.
The parties were regularly in court.
In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic.
His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001.
In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001.
He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage.
His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years.
The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia.
HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively.
With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage.
The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000.
Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300.
The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000.
The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears.
The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001.
The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears.
The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","[247, 248, 242, 2, 0, 1, 5, 241, 4, 6, 246, 245, 239, 8, 237, 7, 240, 3, 11, 9, 10, 244, 236, 243]"

         I am directed by the order for trial by Mills J. to determine, amongst other things, the incomes of the parties.
Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes.
The support order is based on the father’s income at that time of $87,794.00.
The father’s income is considerably higher now.
In addition, the father will pay $284.00 each month, beginning December 1, 2007, for the s. 7 expenses, until further order, or for as long as Michael and Jessica remain children within the meaning of the Divorce Act.
         The mother seeks costs for two court appearances, before this was set down for trial, when she was represented by counsel.
The mother is entitled to costs in the amount of $500.00, payable forthwith.

A trial on the issues of the son's residence in 2006, the parties' income for the purposes of child support and any s. 7 expenses was held.
HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son.
This is a period of no more than 5 months.
Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother.
The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.
 2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629.
The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3)
The parties have been divorced since 1998.
The son has played baseball since 2004.
The daughter has speed skated since 2001.
The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father.
It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses.
Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him.
To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.
 4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines.
The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually.
The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years.
The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription.

                                                                                     ANALYSIS
Is it in the best interest of Keeler to relocate from Saskatoon to Edmonton with Charlene?
            At the commencement of the trial the parties agreed that there should be an order for joint custody and provided Charlene remained in Saskatoon, Keeler’s primary residence was to be with her.
The issue that I am to determine is whether it is in Keeler’s best interest to relocate with Charlene to Edmonton, Alberta.
                        This is the first determination of residence of Keeler given that the order of June 16, 2004, was an interim order.
Therefore I concluded that supervised access is no longer required.
Child Support:
          The parties have filed their respective income information and I will make the requisite child support order based on that evidence.
                                                          CONCLUSION
1.           There will be an order that Charlene Millar and Harley Jason Strouts shall have joint custody of the child, Harley Keeler Strouts-Millar, born May 27, 2002;
7.           Costs - The matter of costs was not spoken to by either party.
The matter of costs may be brought back before me on seven days notice.","The parties separated in October 2003.
They have a child born May 27, 2002.
The parties have agreed to an order of joint custody with the child residing primarily with the petitioner.
The petitioner wishes to move from Saskatoon to Edmonton.
HELD: Based on the loss of the respondent as an active co-parent and the petitioner's vague and uncertain plans for the child's care in Edmonton, it is not in the best interests of the child that he be allowed to relocate to Edmonton with the petitioner.","[11, 0, 235, 224, 10, 223, 1, 139, 222, 140, 221, 12, 141, 225, 234, 142, 122, 143, 17]"

MARGARET HENRY
                                              JUDGMENT
1.       When Elmer Schmidt, who was travelling west on Highway 306 near Grey, Saskatchewan, saw a car driven by Margaret Henry approach from his right, stop at the stop sign, and then proceed forward toward the highway, he applied his brakes with such force that his truck entered a skid, left the highway, and struck the side of the car.
The damages to both the truck and the car exceeded the $500.00 insurance deductible.
He could have applied his brakes, maintained control of his vehicle, and moved into the oncoming lane.
7.       Most of the fault in this accident is attributable to Schmidt's inappropriate reaction to the situation.
However, although Henry complied with the rules of the road, a prudent driver in this situation would come to a stop further back from the highway to ensure that oncoming drivers would know that they had been seen and yielded to.
I attribute 10% of the fault in this accident to Henry and 90% to Schmidt.
In conclusion, Schmidt will have Judgment against the Henrys in the amount of $50.00.
On the other hand, the counterclaim succeeds against Schmidt in the amount of $450.00.
They will also have Judgment for the cost of two subpoenas.

 Judge of the Provincial Court   ","The parties were involved in an accident.
The defendant stopped at a stop sign 39 feet from the intersection and rolled forward while yielding.
The plaintiff locked his brakes and skidded into the defendant, attempting to avoid an accident.
Damage to both vehicles exceeded the insurance deductibles and both parties claim damages against each other for the amount of the deductibles.
HELD: The plaintiff will have judgment against the defendant in the amount of $50.
The defendant will have judgment against the plaintiff in the amount of $450 plus costs.
Fault for this accident was attributed 10% to the defendant and 90% to the plaintiff.
The defendant had indeed yielded properly but could have been more prudent in insuring that other motorist were aware that she yielded.

Analysis
A.              The parenting judgment
The petitioner’s request is to change to the parenting time in the judgment and delete the respondent’s final decision making provision.
His wish is to share decision making responsibilities with the respondent.
He asserts at paragraph 38 of his affidavit of November 23, 2009, that “the respondent has acted as if she is the only authority and occasionally attempts to control parenting decisions”.
The petitioner in his reply affidavit of April 29, 2010, says the following at paragraph 18:
I find that his child support obligation from June 1, 2009, to May 1, 2010, is $797.
The petitioner therefore owes the respondent $420 for child support as he appears to have paid only the original $762 per month.
The $420 is to be paid by the petitioner within thirty days.
[20]            The respondent has been successful in having the petitioner’s applications to vary dismissed.
She is therefore entitled to her costs, which I fix in the amount of $1,500  to be paid within thirty days.
                                                                                                                               R. D. Maher","The petitioner and respondent are the parents of twins.
The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order.
The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent.
The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner.
The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children.
For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time.
The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children.
The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis.
The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come.
The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children.
HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement.
The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children.
The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement.
The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order.
The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased.
The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed.
The respondent was awarded costs.","[12, 0, 64, 65, 104, 102, 66, 103, 19, 11, 67, 1, 101, 100, 68, 63, 69, 47, 99]"

         The petitioner shall pay to the respondent by way of interim spousal support the sum of $500.00 per month commencing September 1, 2012 and payable on the first of each month thereafter.
         The petitioner shall receive credit for monies which he has paid from September 1, 2012 onward.

The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'.
The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting.
The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount.
The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession.
The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it.
She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000.
The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children.
HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement.
Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck.
The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013.
The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses.
The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month.
The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","[157, 1, 0, 156, 2, 154, 4, 152, 155, 3, 151, 5, 153, 7, 8, 6, 10, 9, 146]"

Costs ordered by Pritchard, J.
There is no evidence this was done with the agreement of Mr. Johnson.  
[8]               Mr. Johnson seeks payment of his costs as ordered by the court.
She is responsible for some significant loans, but in my view she has a responsibility to fund her own education, particularly when it appears she did not apply herself to achieving some success.

Ms. Nygren deposes she was fully supportive of Amanda’s choices throughout.

The child was not performing well in her program with no explanation for her poor performance.
HELD The burden is on the petitioner to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence.
Although the child is a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act during the time she was attending classes, her expenses are excessive.
The child provided no evidence to rebut the respondent's information that she did not attend many of her classes.

INTRODUCTION
An order to this effect is not necessary and I decline to grant this aspect of Ms. McPhail’s application.
ANALYSIS
Has Ms. McPhail established a prima facie case that Dr. Hunt stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order?
If so, what is the appropriate amount of child support, base and s. 7, that ought to be paid?
            The fact that one is not the biological parent of a child does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide financial support for that child.
“Parent” is defined by s. 2 of the Act and includes the following provision:
Paying any money to any party at this interim stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the above-noted decisions.
Rather, it is best for this money to remain in trust until a final resolution of outstanding issues is achieved.
Accordingly, Ms. McPhail’s application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.
The sum of $2,349 currently held in trust by counsel for Ms. McPhail shall continue to be held in trust pending final resolution or mutually agreed otherwise in writing between the parties.
COSTS
                                                                                                                     M.D. POPESCUL","The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse.
She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children.
The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt.
The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him).
They separated in July 2008.
The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997.
The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000.
HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children.
The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits.
The determination will have to be made after trial.
2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation.
The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case.
In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay.
The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000.
Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth.
The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested.
A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems.
The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term.
A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount.
The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.
 3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court.
It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner.
The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","[13, 0, 204, 207, 12, 1, 202, 55, 46, 54, 56, 201, 57, 203, 14, 59, 199]"

Jeremy A. Caissie                                                                              for the petitioner
[38]                  I hasten to note that the mother has a legal duty to promote and foster this access.
She should be aware that it is this court’s expectation that she will do all in her power to ensure the children have this access and that it is meaningful.
This matter has not gone to trial and is far from concluded.
Her willingness (or lack of same) to ensure a connection between the children and their father may well be a significant factor in her remaining the primary parent.
             Accordingly, I make the following order:
The mother shall remain the interim primary parent for the two children, and shall be allowed to move on an interim basis from Nokomis to Kenaston, Saskatchewan.
The children shall have regular telephone access to their father every three weeks, as may be arranged, until the father is released from custody.
If the further types of communication mentioned above are possible, the telephone access shall be converted accordingly.
No order as to costs.
                                                                                                                     R.W. DANYLIUK","The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant.
She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse.
The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year.
The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail.
The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order.
One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner.
HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis.
The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances.
The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour.
The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release.
This is not a realistic option.
It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial.
With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children.
The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time.","[183, 182, 1, 2, 0, 181, 178, 4, 180, 5, 6, 179, 3, 177, 176, 8, 7, 174, 9, 175]"

No evidence was presented regarding the potential value of the petitioner’s claim.
Accordingly, for the time being, the restraining order will attach only to the first $40,000.00 of funds received by the respondent if and when any amount, whether by judgment or settlement, becomes payable to him pursuant to the Action.
As indicated, this $40,000.00 figure is purely arbitrary and either party may at any time apply to raise or lower it based on evidence available at the time of such application.
         The Court is not satisfied that the restraining order should extend to any one other than the respondent.
Section 8 only authorizes restraining orders against those against whom a claim under the Act may be made since it is only they who may dispose of or waste assets from which claims may be satisfied and thereby impair or defeat a claim.
The ex parte restraining order against MLT shall therefore be lifted.
         Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance under the Act which may be brought back before any presiding judge upon ten days’ notice.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action.
The respondent applies to have the order set aside.
The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders.
He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction.
The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act.
HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act.
Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security.
For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him.
The parties may apply to vary this amount in future.
Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance.
The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act.
If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act.
As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations.
Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act.
The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim.
When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","[86, 85, 87, 84, 0, 1, 83, 3, 2, 82, 4, 80]"

Was Warren a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997, after July 2004?
The factors are equally applicable to the application before me.
The factors set out in Zaba, supra, are the following:
(a)     Is the child eligible for student loans or other financial assistance”
(b)     Are the child’s career plans reasonable?

Mr. Brown is ordered to pay the sum of $90.50 on March 1, 2006 for the month of March 2006.
I further direct that on the application of Ms. Donald, there be a review of whether or not Warren is then a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997 in August of 2006.

The respondent seeks an order that his child support obligations for their child ended July 2004 because their child ceased to be a person within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from his mother's charge.
HELD: 1)
The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February.
He returned to high school in the fall of 2004.
He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother.
Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media.
He is still under his mother's charge.
She provides him with room and board.
He is only 19 years old.
He has been pursuing his education.
The fact that he changed his course of study does not disentitle him to consideration for support.
He is a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act.
This will continue until March 2006 when he has completed his current course of study.
2) The respondent's income fluctuates.
It is appropriate to take an average of the last 3 years to determine his income.
 3) Some attention must be paid to the financial ability of each parent to contribute.
After deducting the table amount, the respondent would have a gross annual income of $19,781.52.
On that basis the court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall for the child, to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts.
The guideline amount is the appropriate amount to be paid until the end of this year's study.","[0, 129, 27, 204, 203, 130, 1, 202, 132, 133, 134, 105, 2, 28, 201, 135, 200, 198, 45, 25]"

JUDGMENT   McINTYRE J.
The petitioner seeks only table support for Melanie.
There is no dispute that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her program.
Insofar as the respondent’s income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000.00 per annum.
There is reference to some expenses being incurred to earn the income but there is no information as to what those expenses are.
The respondent did provide a “pay stub” for May 2006.
This is in a sense, an interim order and the question of the respondent’s income for child support purposes can be addressed at the pre-trial conference.
Based upon an income of $53,000.00 the respondent shall pay child support to the petitioner commencing May 1, 2006, in the amount of $741.00 per month for the support of their two children.
Support for Melanie will continue so long as she continues in her program.
The issue of costs shall be left to the trial judge.
          D. E. W. McIntyre","The petitioner seeks child and spousal support.
The parties signed a separation agreement and interspousal contract in July 2004.
With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1)
The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum.
The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance.
It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'.
This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support.
The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist.
2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program.
Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year.
The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006.
It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000.

Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties.
The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one.
The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses.
The eldest required braces.
The mother's income was $1,089 per month.
The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order.
The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children.
The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance.
HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance.
Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.
 1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application.
The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander).
A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor.
The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently.
The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children.
3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles.
Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.
 4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","[0, 57, 1, 54, 2]"
394,"The petitioner (mother) seeks retroactive child and spousal support.
Her application is rather unusual because no children are presently dependent upon her and by her own admission she is self-sufficient.
Nevertheless, she claims her former husband did not pay sufficient support when both she and the children were dependent upon him and now wants a catch- up payment of $47,367.
The parties were married in 1963.
The mother was 16 years old and unemployed.
The father was a 21-year-old seasonal worker in the construction trade.
Their marriage followed the traditional pattern of father as breadwinner and mother as homemaker.
In any event, not much turns on the date of separation.
The mother was entitled to make a claim for support whenever she believed the father`s contribution to be inadequate, whether or not she perceived herself separated from him.
But she did not do so until 1996 and then did not prosecute her claim for another two years, at a time when neither she nor the children were dependent.
The primary purpose of a support order is not to compensate for past failure, but instead, to satisfy present need.
Making a retroactive support order would not address that purpose.

BOGDASAVICH, PCJ                              JUDGMENT
3) that the defendant “owed a duty of care to the plaintiff to ensure that she had clear and explicit statutory authority for the actions she took against him, and failed to discharge that duty of care and thereby caused harm to the plaintiff in the tort of negligence”.
ANALYSIS
Charter of Rights
The plaintiff has chosen to sue the defendant in her personal capacity and has not added the Rural Municipality of Sherwood or the three  councillors who voted to uphold the Reeve’s decision  as defendants.
It was obvious from the evidence presented to the court that the R.M. council was divided into two factions.
The plaintiff further relies upon the tort of negligence to claim damages against the defendant.
He alleges that the defendant owed him a duty of care “to ensure that she had clear and explicit statutory authority for the actions that she took against him”.
While it is clear that the plaintiff and defendant were in a relationship that created a duty of care, I find that because the defendant was acting on the advice of counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff that she has not breached the standard of care.
In short, her actions were not negligent.
CONCLUSION
____________________, PCJ","The plaintiff alleges the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and has caused the plaintiff humiliation and distress, through her actions as Reeve of the Council of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood.
The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries.
Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions.
The plaintiff is a councillor.
The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act.
There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council.
The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions.
HELD: The claim is dismissed.
1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter.
While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council.
The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents.
The dispute between the parties is a political one.
A court should be reluctant to get involved.
2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful.
This requirement has not been met.
The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality.
There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant.
As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff.
3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care.
Her actions were not negligent.","[133, 135, 1, 2, 132, 83, 131, 84, 130, 85, 129, 3, 86, 13, 82]"

JUDGMENT                                                GUNN J. September 28, 1995          Stephie Sokulski (""the applicant"") applies for an order pursuant to s. 14 of The Attachment of Debts Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. A-32 (""the Act""), paying out to her certain monies paid into court by the Royal Bank of Canada and by Martindale Holdings Ltd. (The Lumsden Hotel) plus the interest thereon.
If the defendants had brought this garnishment appeal forward in a timely way, we would have directed that the monies be paid out to them but now that the plaintiff has successfully resisted the appeal from the trial judgment, we decline to do so.
The monies now in court are available for payment of the judgment.
However, we emphasize the clear error of the learned Chamber judge in making the order that he did and wish to make it clear that this practice should not be followed in future.          Accordingly I am satisfied in the circumstances before me that the monies paid into court by the Royal Bank and the Lumsden Hotel are available for payment of the plaintiff's judgment notwithstanding the deficiencies.
I am also satisfied the court has the discretion to order the payment of the money to the plaintiff as a judgment creditor.          I order that the monies held in court to the credit of this cause be paid to the plaintiff.
I make no order as to costs as this chambers application would have been unnecessary had the proper procedures been followed in the first instance.                                                                J.","The Plaintiff applied for payment out of certain monies paid into court in response to 3 garnishee summons served on 2 garnishees after judgment.
The first summons was never served on the Defendant.
Of the other 2, only 1 was served on the Defendant.
Further, although 1 garnishee was only served twice, it paid monies into court on 5 occasions.
There was no application to set aside any of the garnishee summons' by the Defendant and he did not appear on this application.
HELD: Application allowed.
1)The court has an inherent power to control its own process in garnishment proceedings.
2)The court also has the discretion to order the payment of the money to the plaintiff as a judgment creditor.
3)The chambers judge ordered that the monies held in court to the credit of this cause be paid to the plaintiff, but made no order as to costs.","[48, 47, 45, 2, 1, 44, 46]"

M.L. Dovell","The plaintiff applies for certification pursuant to The Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight from the Dominican Republic to Regina.
The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties.
The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract.
HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act.
The application for certification is dismissed on that basis.
1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999.
The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear.
Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999.
The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action.
2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999.
strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking.
It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish.
It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361.

[1]            The plaintiff, Glenrose Farms (“Glenrose”), purchased a new Meyer Manure Spreader, Model 5570 (the “Spreader’), from the defendant, Apollo Distributing Corporation (“Apollo”), on December 1, 1999.
Purchase price for the Spreader was $37,000.00, the balance of which was paid in full, upon delivery.
Delivery was made on or about April 1, 2000.
The defendant, Meyer Mfg. Corp. (“Meyer”) manufactured the Spreader.
It was agreed that the present proceeding would determine issues between the plaintiff and the defendant Apollo only.
Subsection 36.3(b) requires the plaintiff to provide written notice to the dealer that the implement does not work well, within a specified period.
Pursuant to s. 36.3(c) the dealer must make the implement perform well within seven days following receipt of the written notice.
If the purchaser has provided the required written notice and the dealer has not taken necessary steps to make the implement work well, the purchaser may, upon giving further written notice, reject the implement.
[17]           The plaintiff has not established on a balance of probabilities that written notice was provided to the defendants in the manner required by s. 36.3(b) of the Act.
[18]           Accordingly, the plaintiff’s claim as against the defendant Apollo is dismissed.
Costs are awarded to the defendant.","The plaintiff bought a spreader from the defendant Apollo Distributing Corporation (Apollo).
The defendant Meyer Mfg. Corp. (Meyer) manufactured the spreader and did not defend the action.
The plaintiff claims that the spreader was entirely unfit for spreading compost and did not meet the warranties imposed by The Agricultural Implements Act.
The plaintiff claimed judgment for the purchase price and damages for repairs to the spreader.
HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed.
The plaintiff did not establish that the spreader was not fit for the purpose of spreading compost or that it was not manufactured in compliance with the warranties in the Act.
1) Other than the fact of a chain breakage on two separate occasions, there was no evidence produced by the plaintiff addressing the cause of breakage.
2) If deficiencies did exist in the spreader, the dealer or distributor are expressly entitled to an opportunity to repair or correct the deficiencies, upon receipt of notice in writing.
The defendants were deprived of the opportunity to inspect and repair by the unreasonable actions of the plaintiff in his failure to allow the return of the spreader.
3) The plaintiff did not establish that written notice was provided to the defendants as required by s. 36.3(b) of the Act.
The Court could not find that the dealer or distributor led the purchaser to believe that the notices were not required to be given pursuant to s. 36.3 of the Act.","[0, 107, 15, 106, 16, 104, 19, 20, 18, 103, 17, 102, 22, 101]"

                  The final claim made by the plaintiff is for distress and inconvenience.
Summary
Finally, he suffered a loss of $1,000.00 as a result of deficiencies.
The total entitlement of the plaintiff is $11,662.44.
            The defendant, D & S Homes Ltd., is still owed $4,007.83 by the plaintiff.
That amount should be set off against the plaintiff’s claim with the result the plaintiff should recover $7,654.61.
            The claim against the defendant, Denis Slater, should be dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant.
Conclusion
            In the result, the plaintiff shall have judgment against the defendant, D & S Homes Ltd., in the amount of $7,654.61.
The claim against the defendant, Denis Slater, is dismissed.
At the request of counsel, the matter of costs may be spoken to on a date arranged with the Local Registrar.","The plaintiff claimed damages for failure to perform as agreed in constructing a residence.
Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower.
The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff.
HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61.
The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim.
1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract.
They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for.
2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost.
3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant.
Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment.
The charges were found to be fit and proper.
4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies.
5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties.
The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest.
He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.
 6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000.
It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","[0, 197, 196, 1, 4, 194, 3, 195, 5, 2, 192, 8, 7, 190, 191, 10, 6, 9, 193, 184, 189, 186, 11]"

[5]               The Plaintiff, Glenn Franklin, testified that he had originally booked a 26 foot, 3 ton truck to move his belongings from his acreage near Edmonton to Nipawin, Saskatchewan.
Upon the designated pick up date however, he was informed that this truck was not available and that arrangements were being made for him to take the subject one ton, 17 foot cube van instead.
d) Dresser and mirror 
According to the photographs tendered and the evidence of the Plaintiff, Glenn Franklin, no damage was sustained to the dresser itself.
The mirror, however, is mildewed and swollen to twice its size and the finish ruined.
These items were acquired in the early 1990's with the mirror costing $249.00.
The Court assesses its current value prior to damage to be $100.00.
IV        CONCLUSION
            See also: Fridman, The Law of Contract 4th Ed. P. 610","The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants.
The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect.
HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service.
1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners.
This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned.
Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed.
Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant.
2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded.
This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took.
The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions.","[89, 84, 1, 23, 83, 11, 24, 82, 81, 22, 25, 80, 79, 18, 26, 17]"

[2]            The plaintiff also claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation Inc. (collectively called “Sullivan”) for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine.
                                                         IV
The only remaining sole issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff.
[19]           The law is well settled that an employee is under an implied obligation not to compete with an employer during the term of his or her employment.
Although Sullivan had given notice that he would no longer work for the plaintiff after September 30th he was still employed at the time he made his proposal.
[20]           I find nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended.
I likewise hold that the plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages.
I also award it $500.00. 
[34]           In the result PCS is entitled to costs against the plaintiff and the plaintiff is entitled to costs against Sullivan.
                                                                                                   I.D. McLellan","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine.
The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff.
HELD: 1)
There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended.
An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends.
He did not prepare the proposals during working hours.
He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina.
However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract.
Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff.
2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal.
There were no union members available for it to hire.
It had no employees ready to perform the contract.
It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December.
If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage.
3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff.
He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets.
He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff.
He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret.
4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","[0, 169, 61, 170, 60, 62, 63, 167, 168, 1, 16, 64]"

DARRELL NORDSTROM and DATAPLAN SECURITIES LTD.
To this case, the situation is analogous to that which occurred in Wilhelm v. Hickson.
Consequently the “disappointed beneficiary” principle is equally applicable in this case involving a financial planner and his client.
            In summary I conclude that Garry Mayer has a cause of action as a disappointed beneficiary and that he suffered damages as a result of Nordstrom’s negligence.
He shall have judgment against Nordstrom for 50 percent of the value of the investment at its maturity, namely $34,250.55.
The plaintiff shall have pre-judgment interest from the date of death of Mayer to the date of this judgment and his costs to be taxed.
            A claim was also made for excess probate fees paid by the estate.
That was a debt of the estate and no action having been brought on its behalf, this portion of the claim is dismissed.
Although Dataplan Securities Ltd. was named as a defendant, no evidence was lead against it and the claim against it is dismissed.
As it was represented concurrently with Nordstrom, there shall be no order as to costs for or against it.","The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants.
The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son.
The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application.
However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered.
The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will.
The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister.
HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.
 1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning.
The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business.
The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation.
The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools.
The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss.
The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case.","[87, 85, 86, 0, 1, 84, 83, 4, 2, 3, 81, 82, 80, 5, 6, 79]"
404,"I am further satisfied Ms. Smid suffered from other pre-existing medical problems prior to the collision and consequently was not a healthy person.
For example, she had weak stomach muscles which Dr. Danilkewich opined made her susceptible to back injury.
I am further satisfied that she had a weak or degenerated disc at L4-L5  and a recurring sciatic condition prior to the collision.
These conditions would flare up together or separately from time to time causing pain of the kind noted by Ms. Smid but would respond favourably to chiropractic and physiotherapy treatments.
I find that at the time of the collision both conditions were dormant.          I believed Ms. Smid when she said that she felt a crunch in her lower back at the time of collision and persistent lower back pain.
In so doing I accept the evidence of Dr. Danilkewich over that of Dr. Elson or Mr. Shiels because as the attending physician, she was in the best position to observe the symptoms Ms. Smid presented both before and after the collision and to evaluate the same from a clinical perspective having regard to Ms. Smid's unique problems.          In summary therefore the answer to the question posed is ""yes"".                               ______________________________J.","The Plaintiff commenced these proceedings seeking to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been suffered in a motor vehicle accident.

HELD: The question posed was answered in the affirmative.
While a normal healthy person might not have been injured in this low speed rear-end collision, the Court was satisfied that, because of the Plaintiff's previous injuries and poor sitting position, the collision did contribute to her current condition in a modest manner.","[135, 137, 133, 134, 132, 131]"

            These meagre facts fall far short of establishing Mr. Huntington is in breach of any fiduciary duty even if one existed.
            To grant injunctions against the respondents in the form requested by Danka, would be tantamount to granting final judgment against them all before trial and consequently for this reason as well an injunction is not an appropriate remedy.
This is subsumed in (i) above.
(iv)  Huntington, Brennan, Brennan Supply, Szott, Kerr and Willis insofar as they are said to have conspired to induce breach of contract or wrongfully interfered with the trade and business of Danka.
            These alleged wrongs are simply not substantiated in any way by the evidence.
In conspiracy and wrongful interference there must be a substrata of evidence to show that the parties committed overt acts from which the tort may be discerned.
The best that could be said of the plaintiff’s case is that it is one of conjecture and inference without any foundation of facts from which inferences may be drawn.
            For all the foregoing, the application for injunctive relief is denied with costs.","The plaintiff employer sought injunctive relief and sought to enforce certain restrictive covenants and to restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any dealings with customers of the plaintiff or pertaining to equipment sold or leased to customers by the plaintiff.
HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow.
These are those reasons. 1)
The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines.
The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business.
2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired.
The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff.
The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients.
3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice.
The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice.
4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants.
The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods.
5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","[203, 202, 0, 201, 200, 1, 4, 3, 198, 2, 199, 197, 5, 7, 195]"

August 13, 2010
INTRODUCTION
The German miller rejected some of the oats as having a high moisture content, the miller refused to pay the defendant, and the defendant refused to pay the farmer.
            This position was essentially stated in a letter from Bio Canada dated August 16, 2006 to Wlaswich’s attorney.
ANALYSIS
            Bio Canada wanted Wlaswich to make a claim under his insurance policy for the loss sustained by Bio Canada.
Wlaswich refused.
As a result thereof, Bio Canada attempted to claim from its insurer and sent a letter on December 28, 2006 to Co-operators Insurance explaining the issue as they saw it in relation to the oats’ shipment.
There is no contractual obligation entered into by Wlaswich that puts that risk on him.
His obligation was to deliver oats of a certain quality to Bio Canada.
On the evidence he has complied with that obligation.
There is nothing further required of him in order to be paid the money owed.
CONCLUSION
            Wlaswich has proven that he has satisfied his contractual obligations to Bio Canada resulting in an obligation by it to pay $61,608 to him to satisfy the contract.
                                                                                                                               R.C. MILLS","The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats.
The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content.
The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content.
In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany.
When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content.
The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation.
HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant.
The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality.
The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff.
There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff.
The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company.
The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs.","[12, 0, 156, 166, 11, 118, 117, 1, 15, 155, 154, 153, 119, 116, 157, 120, 13, 152]"

Nor am I satisfied, on the evidence, that Sturgis Meats was regularly having their monitoring equipment serviced or repaired.
That is obviously so given the lack of any request for Gardon Securities to attend for a check of or the repair of the equipment after the incident, but as well I note from the evidence that the monitoring equipment was last serviced on January 19, 2010, about seven months before this incident and more than the minimum of six months suggested by Gardon Securities on their invoice.
[25]           Given that I find the explanation of what happened in this case, as given by Mr. Stoll, to be at the least as plausible as that presented on behalf of Sturgis Meats, I am not satisfied on a balance of probabilities the plaintiff has proved that the defendant breached this contract by failing to monitor the freezer temperature and by failing to respond to Sturgis Meats.

                  The final consideration concerns the “effective date” of the policy referred to in the exclusionary clause.
As I said in opening, the policy under review was in effect from August 1, 1997 to July 31, 1998.
This letter was written after Hurd experienced the pneumothorax and, perhaps more importantly after Wrishko was informed about it.
If, as Wrishko now claims, Hurd was excluded from coverage because of the August experience, he did not raise it as an issue.
I attach no significance to what he now says.
                  In summary I conclude that MSI insured Hurd for medical services required by him while outside the province of Saskatchewan for the period from August 1, 1997 to July 31, 1998.
I find that during that period of time, in February 1998, Hurd required medical attention and surgery, necessarily performed in Chicago, for a condition undetected earlier by qualified medical personnel and therefore not a pre-existing condition as that term is defined in the policy.
            The plaintiff will therefore have judgment for the sum of $26,864.46 prayed for in this action together with costs to be taxed.","The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from MSI for the time he expected to reside in the USA pursuing studies.
The policy did not cover the periods he would be in Saskatchewan where he ordinarily resided with his parents.
The plaintiff suffered chest pain following a water-skiing accident in August 1997 in Saskatchewan and underwent a thoracostomy for a collapsed lung while in Saskatchewan.
He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA.
MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy.
The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary.
They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb.
HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $26,864.46 plus costs, to be taxed.
1)The evidence that travel was dangerous and put the plaintiff's life in jeopardy was accepted.
Therefore the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for the surgery.
2)The exclusionary clause did not exempt MSI from liability for payment.
The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation under the policy to extend the benefits in question.
The policy was in effect from August 1, 1997 to July 31, 1998.
It was not raised in a letter confirming the dates of his coverage sent after the plaintiff had experienced the pneumothorax of which MSI had been informed.","[0, 1, 99, 97, 96, 2, 4, 3, 94, 95, 98, 5, 6, 92, 7, 91]"

Jennifer D. Pereria                                                            for the defendant applicant
             In the case at bar, I look at the tests of relevance and necessity.
             Clearly in the trying and/or settlement of the case against Mr. Hoeppner the amounts already paid are relevant.
Cases such as Dos Santos and Brown v. Cape Breton speak to the notion of the court protecting against double recovery.
Also in that vein, I find that the settlement amounts in the Wawanesa case are necessary to protect against that notion of double recovery.
             I therefore order that the settlement amounts arrived at in the minutes of settlement be disclosed.
If those settlement amounts relate to structure by structure then those amounts will individually be disclosed.
SUMMARY
             Regarding the application to strike the plaintiff’s claim for want of prosecution, I find that for the initial period of May 2006 to May 2010 the delay was inordinate but excusable.
             With regard to the disclosure of settlement amounts I find that the defendant has made its case and order those specific amounts for each structure for which Wawanesa settled its claim to be disclosed.
                                                                                                                           D.B. KONKIN   ","The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant.
In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire.
He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001.
In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff.
The defendant filed his defence in April 2007.
Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011.
At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused.
The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit.
The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution.
The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable.
The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis.
Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference.
2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant.
3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings.
4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered.
5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control.
The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications.
Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","[137, 138, 135, 0, 1, 2, 5, 133, 3, 134, 132, 4, 131, 6, 8, 130, 9, 7, 128, 129]"

       The plaintiff shall have judgment against the
costs and pre‑judgment interest on $10,000 from January 1,
1990 to December 31, 1990.
This interest has been limited
because the plaintiff ought to have brought the matter on for
trial more expeditiously.
He cannot expect to receive
interest for the years in which he did not vigorously
prosecute his claim.
This is especially so here where the
non‑pecuniary damage issue was uncomplicated.","The Plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from the Defendant.
He accidentally injected one of his fingers with paint.
The finger had to be amputated.
He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer.
HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.
 1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type.
It operated at 2,500 lbs. pressure.
This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user.
The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn.
2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor.
Where an enterprise or activity is inherently dangerous, the duty to warn can not be delegated.
In such a situation the party who retains the independent contractor remains vicariously liable.
3)The waiver in the rental contract was ineffective.
It was a standard form agreement signed on its face with the terms of the contract on the reverse.
4)The Plaintiff was awarded general damages of $10,000.00, $5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and recovered $3,789.50 for SHSP.
5)The usual increase in general damages for inflation and pre-judgment interest were both reduced because the Plaintiff had not presecuted his action expeditiously.","[0, 366, 365, 367, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 363, 362, 364, 360, 9, 8, 10, 361, 355, 359, 7, 356, 12, 16, 14, 352, 13, 350, 351, 349, 11, 348, 18, 346, 347, 15, 358, 23]"

[2]                  The City of Saskatoon is deleted as a defendant.
[3]                  Paragraph 74 of the judgment assigning vicarious liability to the City of Saskatoon is deleted.","The plaintiff seeks damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction.
During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp.
He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning.
The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service.
The City of Saskatoon is their employer.
HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed.
The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle.
The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount.
It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements.
1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge.
The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty.
The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully.
The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty.
2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help.
Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa.
Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers.
Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty.
There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty.
3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions.
The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty.
The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed.
4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention.
The plaintiff experienced headaches for several weeks.
He also had stiff neck and sleep disturbance.

(b)    The degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident.
                                                             CONCLUSION
 [11]               The defendant, as owner and occupier of the Superstore, had a duty of care to the plaintiff.
The judicial authorities have most often based the duty of care upon the invitor/invitee standard.
A regular program of maintenance had been conducted by the defendant in that area of the store.
The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance of the floor areas combined with the responsibility of each employee to carry them out were substantially the same, if not identical to, those considered by this Court in the Mollenhauer and Leibel group of cases.
 [21]               I conclude that the defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and is not liable for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff.
To find otherwise would be to impose a standard upon the defendant in this case that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this Court in almost identical circumstances.
 [22]               Accordingly, the plaintiff's claim is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000.
The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces.
Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue.
The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules.
HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.
1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier.
The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard.
Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care.
2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor.
The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor.
3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor.
The employee was no longer employed by the defendant.
Neither party was able to locate him.
4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions.
The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice.
The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision.
5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department.
The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping.
A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area.
The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases.
The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries.
To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","[0, 95, 15, 54, 94, 53, 1, 93, 14, 55, 91, 92]"

This issues in this case largely involve Part III of The Consumer Protection Act, S.S. c.-30.1, and inter alia, the question of whether or not a consignee is a “retail seller” as defined in that Part.
FACTS
In the period between purchase on May 23, 2002, and notification on August 12th (a period of 82 days) the vehicle was driven slightly less than 5,000 kilometres.  
ISSUES AND ANALYSIS
The law of Contract clearly recognizes that there is a contract (the consignment contract) between the consignor (Mr. Oborowsky) and the consignee (Triple R).
There is also a contract (the sales contract) between Mr. Oborowsky (the vendor) and Mr. Finch (the purchaser).
60 Where a consumer rejects a consumer product pursuant to clause 57(1)(b):
In my view an equitable amount is $.06 per kilometre, amounting to $300.
Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s judgment is reduced by this sum, such that the final figure is $1542.35.
Upon payment of this sum, the Plaintiff will execute such a bill of sale in respect of this vehicle in favour of the Defendant.
The Plaintiff will have his costs of this matter which I set at $20.
SUMMARY
David J. Kaiser, P.C.J.","The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b).
Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600.
The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'.
The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on.
The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement.
Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair.
The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts.
At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act.
HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven.
1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA.
If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group.
Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive.
It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality.
The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so.
The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation.
It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time).
3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character.
4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period.
The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product.
The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed.","[0, 209, 205, 14, 1, 13, 15, 2, 204, 90, 203, 91, 16, 202, 92, 199, 201, 93]"

L.A. Matsalla, P.C.J.                                 JUDGMENT
The plaintiff student argues that she was unjustly dismissed and so she sues the defendant business for wages that she would have earned had she worked to the end of the term of her employment.
The employer argues that the plaintiff was dismissed for cause.
The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12th.
Subsequent to the end of her employment she sought and she obtained work for which she was paid $657.83.
The onus is on the employer to establish that the employee failed to mitigate her loss (see Red Deer College v. Michaels and Finn, 1975 CanLII 15 (SCC), [1975]
5 W.W.R. 575 (S.C.C.) at pp 580-81).
In this case the plaintiff made reasonable effort to seek and maintain employment.
The plaintiff would have received employment income to the end of August, 2004 in the amount of $2,592.00 and she would have received holiday pay in the amount of $149.56.
She earned the sum of $657.83 from other employment during that time period.
Therefore she is entitled to damages in the amount of $2,083.73.
A Certificate of Judgment will issue in her favour in that amount and for costs in the amount of $20.00.","The plaintiff student argues that she was unjustly dismissed and so sues the defendant business for wages that she would have earned had she worked to the end of the term of her employment.
The employer argues that the plaintiff was dismissed for cause.
HELD: 1)
The employer spoke to the employee on three occasions about her work and by his own admission, the employee made an effort to improve.
At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment.
It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her.
In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal.
Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.
 2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004.
The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12.
But for her dismissal, she would have worked for the rest of July and for the month of August or 36 days.
3) In this case the plaintiff made reasonable effort to seek and maintain employment.
She earned $657.83.
4) The plaintiff is awarded judgment in the amount of $2,083.73.","[111, 112, 1, 2, 108, 4, 110, 5, 109, 6, 3, 107, 7, 105, 106, 103, 9, 8, 11, 10]"

I am satisfied Curniski conducted his investigation of the planes in a fair and impartial manner and in accordance with common industry practice.
         In the end result, the plaintiff was treated fairly by the defendant and no unfair advantage was given to Nielsen & Ashdown in selecting the successful tenderer on the project.
         The plaintiff’s action is dismissed.
While costs usually follow the result, this is an appropriate case in which to exercise my discretion to disallow costs to the successful party.
Why these reasons appear in the recommendation is difficult to say.
Perhaps it is simply the unfathomable product of bureaucracy.
But, in any event, I cannot fault the plaintiff for believing it had been treated unfairly and for commencing the action.
It was only after trial and a full vetting of the evidence that one could say with satisfaction that the plaintiff was treated fairly.
I award no costs of this action.
The exhibits filed by the parties may be returned to them at the expiration of the appeal period.","The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender of four made in response to the defendant's invitation to tender on a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan.
HELD: The action was dismissed.
1)The tender package contained the usual privilege clause which stated the lowest tender need not be accepted.
It is an implied term of the contract that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenders fairly and will not give any an unfair advantage.
 2)The plaintiff had no experience in the type of pesticide spraying.
It was not known at the time that the plaintiff made arrangements to hire an experienced subcontractor.
The consultant hired to advise the defendant on the technical aspects of the project used reliable independent sources for his information about the operational viability of the planes.
He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.
 3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","[0, 72, 71, 70, 1, 69, 3, 2, 4, 68, 67, 6, 5, 7, 65, 8, 64, 63, 9, 62]"

April 13, 1995
       The defendant, A. F. D. (""A.""), is the
step-father of the plaintiff.
He pleaded guilty to a criminal
charge of sexually assaulting the plaintiff.
On February 13,
The plaintiff

When she
depression, her inability to be fully intimate with her
assaults, both for herself and her daughter.
She is therefore
entitled to an award of aggravated damages.
       But for the contribution to her loss by her uncle,
the plaintiff would be entitled to an award of non-pecuniary
damages in the amount of $50,000 and to an award of aggravated
damages in the amount of $25,000.
Because the uncle
contributed to the loss encompassed by the non-pecuniary
The aggravated
damage award, however, is intended to compensate the plaintiff
for her loss attributable solely to her step-father's wrong
doing and is consequently not subject to any reduction.
       The plaintiff is therefore entitled to judgment
against A. F. D. in the amount of $65,000, together
with her taxable costs.","The Plaintiff sued her stepfather for damages for sexual assault.
He had previously been convicted of a criminal charge based upon the same incident.
He did not defend the civil proceedings and the Plaintiff applied to have her damages assessed.
The evidence in the civil trial also disclosed that the Plaintiff had be sexually assaulted by her uncle.
HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.
1)The Plaintiff had been diagnosed as suffering from severe psychological problems as a result of the sexual assaults.
2)The Court assessed the Plaintiff's non-pecuniary damages at $50,000.00 and apportioned 80% of this sum or $40,000.00 to the step-father.

419,"JUDGMENT                                             BAYNTON J. November 7, 1996          Peter sues his father's estate for damages for breach of a farm lease and for the value of his farm labour.
It was written out by his father on the back of an envelope in the spring of 1993.
A copy was given to Peter and his father kept a copy.
The agreement gave Peter the right to farm two quarters of his father's land in 1994 with his father's farm machinery.
2.The quantum of the damages are $6,500.00. 3.Peter does not have an enforceable quantum meruit claim for the value of his farm labour in 1993 expended on behalf of his father.
4.The $17,800.00 mortgage (and interest) granted by the father to Farm Credit Corporation to raise the sum of $17,500.00 to clear his land from the Bank of Montreal mortgage is not a debt enforceable by the estate against Peter. 5.Peter shall have his costs against the estate on a party and party basis for that portion of his claim on which he was successful and for defending the counterclaim.
The issues raised by the claim and counterclaim are not typical ""estate"" issues.
Solicitor and client costs against the estate are accordingly not appropriate.
6.It was agreed by the parties that judgment should not issue against the non appearing defendant, Edward Chobotar, nor against any of the other defendants personally.","The plaintiff sued his father's estate for breach of a farm lease and for the value of his farm labour.
The estate counterclaimed for a mortgage debt incurred by the father on behalf of the plaintiff.
The plaintiff was not included in his father's Will as a beneficiary and the Will contained no reference to the mortgage debt.
The father's statement of assets filed in his divorce and matrimonial property action did not disclose it as an asset.
HELD: 1)The unsigned handwritten memorandum evidenced a binding agreement for lease between the plaintiff and his father.
He affirmed the lease in his discussions with a daughter.
2)The plaintiff neither repudiated the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it. 
The fact that he did not vigorously contest the right of his brother to farm the land on behalf of the estate did not estop him from suing for damages for his father's breach of the lease. 
Damages of $6,500 were awarded.
3)The plaintiff failed to establish a quantum meruit claim.
He did not produce any documents to show he had been reimbursed for his labour on the farm in prior years.
Other family members helped with the farming from time to time.
He did nothing while his father was alive to demand or obtain payment.
4)Even if the mortgage was considered a debt in 1989 it was subsequently forgiven.
It was significant that the plaintiff was not included as a beneficiary and the amount of the mortgage was similar to the bequests to the other children.
5)The plaintiff was awarded his costs against the estate on a party and party basis for that portion of his claim on which he was successful and for defending the counterclaim.
Solicitor and client costs against the estate were not appropriate as the issues raised by the claim and counterclaim were not typical estate issues.
Judgment issued against the two executors in their representative capacity.","[1, 88, 87, 89, 3, 4, 85, 5, 86]"

Andrew M. Mason                                                                     for the defendants
[106]               In my opinion, this is not a situation for aggravated or punitive damages based on the evidence.
[107]               Counsel for the defendants urge only nominal damages.
Counsel on behalf of the plaintiff has requested very significant damages.
[108]               The awarding of damages and particularly in a defamation case is particularly subjective.
In this case we have a plaintiff who was defamed, but within the context of his administrative functions vis-à-vis an unfortunate and protracted labour relations situation.
[109]               I am not satisfied that the level of insult and level of loss of reputation in this particular case are consistent with the sizable damage awards urged by plaintiff’s counsel.
[111]               I have found that Dr. Rubin indeed was defamed.
However, the defendants have successfully raised the defence of qualified privilege.
Accordingly, there were mixed results in this litigation.
Therefore, I have decided to exercise my discretion and not to award costs to any party (excepting of course any award of costs already ordered).
                                                                                                                               T.J. KEENE","The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants.
He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process.
The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college.
He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website.
The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself.
The plaintiff seeks damages and costs.
He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable.
He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD:
The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.).
In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed.
The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege.
This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth).
The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers.
The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz).
The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body.
In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college.
The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege.
This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty.
The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties.
The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice.
There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds.
Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis.
There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident.
The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000.
Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","[445, 444, 443, 2, 5, 1, 437, 439, 447, 435, 436, 0, 438, 4, 446, 11, 10, 6, 3, 429, 12]"
421,"The plaintiff alleges the contract price stipulated in the RTM agreement of June 26, 1992, and signed by both parties, was in error and seeks rectification of the contract.          The plaintiff has been building RTMs in the City of Yorkton since 1979.
An RTM as supplied by the plaintiff does not come with a basement.
It is the practice of the plaintiff to price an RTM and basement separately if a prospective purchaser seeks to have the plaintiff provide a basement as well as the RTM.
That portion of paragraph 3 of the contract where it provided for an interest rate to be inserted was left blank.
It was Mr. Batiuk's evidence that there was no interest called for as it was his understanding that the RTM would not be leaving the plaintiff's premises until it was paid for in full.
The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and I am not satisfied that there was an agreement reached by the parties to pay interest.
The plaintiff's claim for interest is dismissed.
The real issue was the claim for rectification.
On that basis, the defendants shall be entitled to costs of the action.                                                             J.","The plaintiff was to build and supply to the defendants a ready to move home (RTM).
The plaintiff alleged the contract price was in error and sought rectification of the contract.
The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had.
HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed.
1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted.
He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement.
The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.
 2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention.
3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest.
The plaintiff was entitled to interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act on the claim for extras to the contract. 4)The claim for the extras was never in dispute.

If the parties do not agree on the amount thereof the matter may be referred to me.
         The theory of notice is that at the end of the period the employment insurance benefits will remain unimpaired.
The defendant can therefore make no deduction for any such insurance payments made to the plaintiff.
         There is to be deducted the amounts which are owing by the plaintiff to the defendant.
This does not include the Saxby account which predated the transfer of the business to the defendant.
I accept that this is a matter between the plaintiff and Saxby.

Fees will be taxed on column 2.

         The Court draws the attention of the parties to ss. 45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act, S.C. 1996, c. 23.","The plaintiff who had been employed by the defendant's predecessor for 23 years as office manager and bookkeeper until 1997, brought an action for damages against her new employers for dismissal without adequate notice.
The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998.
The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules.
HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period.
Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause.
Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time.
Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year.
She remained entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at the time of termination and to medical expenses that would have been covered but without bonuses or extra payments for sick pay.
2)The defendant did not establish the plaintiff ought to have done more to mitigate her loss.
There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.
 3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment.
Amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant were to be deducted.
4)The plaintiff was entitled to interest in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act.
5)The defendant could make no deduction for insurance benefit payments.
Sections 45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act was drawn to their attention. 6)The plaintiff was awarded costs.
Fees were to be taxed on column 2. 7)The plaintiff was to deliver a copy of the calculation of the judgment.

423,"Johnson Seeds purchases specialty crops from producers and contracts with purchasers, including other traders or packagers, for the resale of these specialty crops.
There is no reason to disbelieve Calcutt that he used the mail in the ordinary course to forward the fully executed copy of the contract to Farr.
The post office was a legitimate agent of Johnson Seeds for the purpose of communicating the acceptance of the offer and to this extent the postal acceptance rule is satisfied.
Further, Farr had verbally confirmed on at least two occasions that he did have a contract with Johnson Seeds and at all times Calcutt confirmed that such a contract did exist.
The only issue about which they disagree is whether payment on or before January 2, 1994, was an essential term of the contract.          For all these reason, I find that there was a valid contract between Johnson Seeds and Farr.
The parties agreed that if I found a valid contract that the measure of damages is $50,850.05 if the appropriate time for assessing damages is January, 1994.
If damages should be assessed at March 1994 the parties agreed that the quantum of damages was $120,345.11.          I find that Johnson Seeds knew in January 1994 that Farr was in breach of the contract and this is when damages should be assessed.","The plaintiff, a specialty seed marketing company, claimed damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract.
Johnson Seeds entered contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting to secure product for resale.
After extended negotiations the defendant eventually signed and mailed the standard form contract but never received an executed copy.
The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993.
The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price.
HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action.
1)There was a valid contract between the parties.
Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract.
2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract.
The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone.
There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist.
Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94.
The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions.
Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.
 4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem.
Johnson Seeds waited until the last possible day under the written contract terms to call the contract in an effort to position itself to claim increased damages for breach of contract.","[161, 162, 160, 159, 164, 163, 2]"

425,"The action against Country Plaza Motors Ltd. (""Country Plaza"") was discontinued.
THEORY OF THE PLAINTIFFS          The plaintiffs contend that the fire was caused by an electrostatic discharge through the U-shaped fuel tube in the Ford truck which was the subject of recall, along with 48,000 others, by Ford.
It was submitted that due to extremely cold weather conditions the electrical insulating qualities of the nylon fuel line were reduced to an extent that the accumulated static electricity discharged through the fuel line.
During this static discharge, pin holes would be created and gasoline would then leak out.
The vapour from the gasoline, being heavier than air, would settle to the bottom of the garage and would be attracted to the pilot light on the furnace.
There would then be a flashback to the area underneath the truck where the gasoline was pooled.

This model of truck was subject to a recall by Ford to correct a fuel line defect.
The Plaintiff called several expert witnesses who testified that, in their opinion, the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire.
Ford called one witness who was the designer of of the truck's fuel system and a Ford employee.
He testified that the defective fuel line could not have leaked sufficient fuel to cause the fire.
He also admitted, however, that his prior written report contained errors.
Rebuttal evidence called by the Plaintiff indicated that the check valve in the fuel pump designed to prevent siphoning from the fuel tank in the event of a leaking fuel line did not operate as the Ford witness had testified.
HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.
The Plaintiff had proved on a balance of probabilities that the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire.
The Plaintiff's experts' evidence was accepted over that of the Ford expert.
No independent experts had been called by Ford.","[157, 156, 4, 2, 3, 1, 158, 5, 7]"

         The motion for certification contains a similar description of the proposed class:
         The affidavit of Mr. Field, who resides in British Columbia and asserts that he took Paxil when he was under 18,  contains the following statements concerning his proposed role as a representative plaintiff for members of the proposed class:
I took the prescription drug Paxil for anxiety disorder and panic attacks and other psychiatric conditions for approximately 3 years while I was under 18 years of age.
My condition was characterized by agoraphobia and social phobia.
My parents purchased Paxil on my behalf from a variety of stores throughout British Columbia.
Out of pocket expenses were incurred to buy Paxil and my parents’ insurance covered the balance of the purchase price of Paxil.
On the basis of the article attached to this my Affidavit as Exhibit “C”, the Health Canada advisory attached as Exhibit “B”, and the Canadian Medical Association Journal Article attached as Exhibit “A”, I believe that taking Paxil put me at increased risk of suicidal ideation and I am grateful that I chose not to make an attempt to take my own life.

April 19, 2006
1)               This is an action by the plaintiffs, Cattell, Mack, Bosenberg and Strassburg pursuant to Part Forty of The Queen’s Bench Rules for damages arising to them from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd., and for a permanent injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the property of the plaintiffs.
                                                 ANALYSIS
30)            Private nuisance is defined as an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of land.
Whether the operation of a golf course adjacent to an individual’s land is defined as being an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of that land appears to depend on the nature and frequency of the behaviour complained of.
I therefore order the following:
(a)     The defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd., Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd., and The Town of White City are hereby enjoined from allowing its members and their guests or any other users of the golf course from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole of the course so that they land anywhere on the plaintiffs’ property.
                                                                                              L. B. MacDonald","The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course.
The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property.
HELD: 1)
The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance.
It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property.
Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property.
In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward.
There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.
 2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties.
The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem.
Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude.
3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year.
4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years.
The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","[0, 22, 1, 85, 84, 117, 21, 116, 2, 115, 87, 23]"
429,"The plaintiffs seek a declaration that they have complied with the requirements of section 27(2) of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, S.S. 1988-89, c.S-17.1 (the ""Act""), and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which are the subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act.
The defendant resists the requested relief on the basis the plaintiffs did not validly exercise their right of first refusal.
Specifically that they did not within the required time frame meet the requirements set out in s. 27(2)(b) of the Act which states:          (2)
The defendant's objections are two fold:          (1)
As I have decided the plaintiffs are entitled to relief in this matter, I will not address the arguments advanced with respect to this issue.
The plaintiffs are entitled to the following relief:          (1)
A declaration they have complied with the                requirements of s. 27 of The Farm Land Security                Act in exercising their right of first refusal                with respect to the subject land.          (2)
An order that the defendant forthwith transfer               to the plaintiffs the subject land for the                price of $629,280.00, which price is payable to                the defendant by the plaintiffs on the usual                trust conditions.          (3)
The defendants counterclaim is dismissed.          (4)
Costs of the action.
Judgment accordingly.                                                             J.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s27 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell them the lands which were subject to their right of first refusal under the Act.
The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation.
The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants.
HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions.
The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed.
1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation.
Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution.
The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs.
2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance.
A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances.
To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal.
There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.","[2, 99, 96, 97, 3, 98, 95, 94, 5, 1, 92]"

THE FINDINGS
[30]           The Plaintiff in the counterclaim, Pacific Home Products Ltd. submitted that the Defendant in the counterclaim, Ens repudiated the contract.
I find that the Plaintiff in the counterclaim, Pacific Home Products Ltd. failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities.
DAMAGES
[31]           With respect to damages I find that The Frustrated Contracts Act, Chapter F-22.2, Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1994, applies.
Under that Act the Court is given discretion to determine what amount of restitution is appropriate in the circumstances.
Every party is entitled to a restitution of benefits conferred by that party’s performance or part performance under the contract on another party prior to the frustration or avoidance.
In determining the value of the benefits conferred, the court shall consider:
a)         the contract price; and
b)         any diminished value of performance caused by the failure to complete the contract.
In determining the value of the expenses lost due to frustration or avoidance, the court shall consider the contract price.
35% apportioned to Dennis Ens and 
Anne Ens                                 $2,023.78
Therefore I award judgment in favour of the Plaintiff Ens’ against the Defendant Pacific Home Products Ltd. in the amount of $176.22.
In the circumstances of this case there will be no order as to costs.
___________________________, J
D.M. ARNOT","The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home.
They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years.
The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom.
The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom.
This provision was fundamental element in the contract.
The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term.
The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.
 The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit.
The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13.
HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22.
In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs.
Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated.
The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract.
It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party.
The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract.
The event was permanent and non-transient.
The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended.
The difference was much more than mere inconvenience.
The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them.
Both parties acted in good faith.
The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract.
The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities.
The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract.
The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities.
Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss.
The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane.
The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely.
The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project.
Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.","[152, 193, 192, 191, 153, 154, 155, 190, 156, 151, 1, 131, 10, 157, 188, 158, 187, 150, 159]"

                                        HISTORICAL REVIEW
[1]            The respondent applies to vary the child support orders of Mr. Justice Kraus dated September 10, 1999, and December 7, 1999, and/or the alleged agreement struck by the petitioner and respondent in or about July, 2003.
In addition to variation of the amount of child support, the respondent asks that the variation order apply retroactively to July 1, 2003.
Finally, the respondent seeks costs to be assessed on a solicitor/client basis.
We suggest that the Order contain a provision that both parties exchange income information in the form of tax returns and notices of assessment by May 15th of each year.
5)         Communications ceased until MacLean Keith wrote to the petitioner on July 18, 2006, in which Mr. Stodalka stated, at paragraph 2:
As you may recall, although we negotiated an agreement in September of 2003 which provided that you would pay child maintenance of $380.00 per month for Ryan and Meghan Goethals, no actual court order was ever taken out.
Mr. Goethals acknowledges that you continued to pay this amount.
                               PROSPECTIVE CHILD SUPPORT
The plaintiff’s claim for reduction in the Table amount of child support must, therefore, fail.

                                                                                           N.S. Sandomirsky","The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support.
HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2)
The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children.
What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college.
What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006.
There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006.
3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part.
There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns.
No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines.
No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'.
The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310.
An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner.
The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children.
4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually.
Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children.
5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category.
The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","[11, 227, 0, 230, 226, 81, 209, 79, 12, 1, 80, 13, 15, 10, 78, 16]"

5)               After the auction sale was concluded, the defendants refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price.
The defendant Ritchie Bros. declared its guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the “Contract to Auction” dated March 28, 2004 and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds.
The contractual provision invoked by this defendant, namely (Clause 4.05), reads as follows:
Clause 3.02 of the Ritchie contract, which deals with the owner’s responsibility to clean and refurbish equipment to a standard acceptable to the Auctioneers, was completed rather ambiguously, in the following manner:
Owner shall:
(b)  all amounts payable to Auctioneers hereunder, including commission and any advances, together with interest thereon which shall be repayable at the time of the sale.
Uncollected Proceeds - Auctioneers may, as it deems necessary, re-auction any part of the Property not sold or paid for at the auction...
The defendant’s claim solicitor-client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract which provides as follows:
4.03 Legal Costs – should either party be required to participate in any action or proceeding in respect of this Contract, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred, including legal fees, on a solicitor and own client basis.

Wilkinson ","The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit.
The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500.
The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie).
The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie.
After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price.
The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds.
The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit.
HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf.
The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit.
A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public.
The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit.
2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit.
It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid.
It actively facilitated bidding.
Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment.
The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose.
It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs.
The plaintiff corporation benefited.
It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract.
'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner.
3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction.
That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information.
He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle.
All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered.
He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4)
In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation.
The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants.
In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.
 5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages.
The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized.
The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6)
The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract.
The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum.
The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument.
The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7)
The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff.
In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","[28, 0, 515, 1, 514, 27, 487, 193, 522, 194, 26, 486]"

January 18, 1999
The petitioner, [K.O.], and the respondent, [C.O.], married on November 14, 1987 and separated for the final time on November 4, 1995.
However, too great a reduction in the amount payable by [K.O.] would limit [C.O.]‘s ability to adequately care for the children while with her.
Many of her costs will not be reduced merely because the children are with her only one-half of the time.
Having considered the foregoing, I am of the view that it is appropriate to reduce the child support payable by [K.O.] pursuant to the table by approximately 30 percent.
The only items of matrimonial property left to be divided are a registered retirement savings plan and [K.O.]‘s employment pension.
The parties agree that these assets, after payment of associated liabilities, should be divided equally.
As well, [K.O.]‘s employment pension will be divided equally at source in accordance with the provisions of his employee pension plan regarding division on marriage breakdown.
Finally, there will be an order dissolving the marriage, not to take effect for 31 days.
There will be no order as to costs.","The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support.
Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP.
The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act.
2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks.
The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home.
Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children.
3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent.
The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month.
The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable.
Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases.
It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time.
The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable.
There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","[0, 229, 3, 2, 4, 228, 1, 5, 7, 225, 6, 227, 224, 8, 220, 221, 222, 9]"

March 3, 1999
[1]               The parties were married July 24, 1993.
There are two children of their relationship:
         Two issues were raised with respect to the division of matrimonial property.
         The second issue is whether a Forenza automobile constituted matrimonial property and if so the value thereof.
The vehicle was purchased by the respondent prior to marriage as a work project.
It was used at one point during the marriage as a means of transportation.
It is said to not be in running condition at this time.
It is an asset in existence as of the date of application.
The onus is on the respondent to establish an exemption.
The evidence in this regard was sketchy and I find the respondent has failed to discharge the onus upon him.
I find the Forenza automobile to constitute matrimonial property.
The only evidence of value was $200.00 and I find that to be the value.
         Either party may speak to costs if they wish.","The primary issue was the appropriate parenting arrangement for the two children.
The 1997 interim order awarded joint custody with the primary residence with the mother and reasonable access to the father including alternating weekends, reasonable telephone access and equal sharing of holidays.
The father initially failed to pay child support as ordered then paid $250 per month rather than the $424.72 ordered.
The parties no longer communicated directly with each other except by e-mail so that there was a record.
HELD: 1)It was in the best interests of the children that their primary residence be with their mother.
She had demonstrated greater flexibility and sensitivity to their needs.
The father was granted access two weekends out of every three and additional time as they may agree upon.
Although both were very good parents the parties had not demonstrated an ability to co-parent effectively as illustrated by their communication problems.
The father's access initially went beyond the minimum required by the interim order.
He failed to make support payments as ordered.
The father was to pay child support of $449.
Pursuant to s.7 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines he was to pay 54% of the net cost of child care expenses incurred as a result of the mother's employment and for health related expenses in excess of $100 of the insurance reimbursement upon production of receipts.
 2)The automobile constituted matrimonial property and was valued at $200. 3)Either could speak to costs.","[1, 0, 162, 158, 159, 2, 161, 4, 3, 157, 160, 5, 7, 8, 6, 155, 9, 154, 10, 156, 150, 153, 11, 12, 13]"

[20]1986 CanLII 1720 (AB QB), [1986]","The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult.
The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue.
The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency.
The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult.
The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989.
The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court.
The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision.
It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult.
HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court.
Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.
 1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges.
If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth.
The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.
 2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application.

Smith J.A. (In Chambers)
Heather L. Nord for the Proposed Appellants
Essentially, the judge in chambers is required to determine whether the issue sought to be raised on the appeal is of sufficient merit and importance to warrant the attention of the Court of Appeal. 
I have concluded that the proposed appeal in this case meets the test set out and that leave should be granted.
In light of the clear wording of Rule 407(2), the question is clearly not frivolous or vexatious.
While the value of the dogs is relatively low, they are clearly highly valued by the parties, and they are, in effect, unique chattels.
The appeal should not unduly delay the proceedings, for it raises a very narrow issue and can proceed to appeal quickly.
Most significantly, it is my view that the ruling of the chambers judge in this case raises an issue of considerable significance to the general operation of the remedy of a writ of replevin as provided in the Rules of Court, and merits consideration by this Court.
Leave to appeal is granted.","The proposed appellants and the proposed respondent were involved in litigation involving the ownership of some valuable breeding dogs that were in the possession of the proposed respondent, but claimed by the proposed appellants.
The proposed appellants sought and obtained a writ of replevin in relation to the dogs.
The proposed respondent applied for an order setting aside the writ, and ordering the dogs returned.
The chambers judge granted the application finding that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information and that to allow the writ to stand would constitute an abuse of process.
The issue on appeal is whether the chambers judge erred in inquiring into the accuracy of the facts sworn to in the proposed appellant's affidavit, in light of the provision in Rule 407(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules that provides that the validity of the writ shall not be questioned in any interlocutory proceeding where the affidavit substantially complies with the requirements of the Rule.
HELD: Leave to appeal is granted.
The ruling of the chambers judge raises an issue of considerable importance to the general operation of the writ of replevin as provided for in the Rules of Court.","[38, 0, 1, 36, 37, 2, 3, 34, 35, 4, 33, 5, 6, 32, 7, 8]"

The parties have not taken out the order and thus I have maintained jurisdiction to decide the matter.
Having read the material and the relevant portions of the Queen’s Bench file I am still of the view the proposed appellants would have little chance of success on appeal.
Costs are a discretionary award and there was material on file upon which the trial judge could base his decision.
I note the proposed appellants failed to firstly apply to the trial judge to obtain leave to appeal as required by section 38 of The Queens Bench Act, 1998[1] which reads as follows:
38  Except with leave of the judge giving the judgment or making the order, the following judgments and orders are not subject to appeal:
(a)  judgments given or orders made by a judge with the consent of the parties;
(b)  subject to the rules of court, judgments given or orders made by a judge as to costs only that, by law, are left to the discretion of the judge.
The application is therefore dismissed with costs on double Column V.","The proposed appellants applied to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal of an order awarding costs payable jointly and personally by Tapp and Spelliscy on the basis the award was punitive and inordinately high.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs on double Column V.
The Court is still of the view the proposed appellants would have little chance of success on appeal.
Costs are a discretionary award and there was material on file upon which the trial judge could base his decision.
The appellants failed to first apply to the trial judge to obtain leave to appeal as required by Queen's Bench Act s.38.","[33, 1, 2, 32, 31, 3, 30, 4, 5, 29, 28, 6, 7, 27, 8, 26]"

Furthermore, nothing in the Chambers judge’s reasons suggests he applied a Rule 173(c) analysis when determining whether “some basis in fact” supported the existence of common issue within the meaning of s. 6(1)(c).
Nor is an analysis by this Court of the interplay between Rule 173(c) and s. 6(1)(c) otherwise warranted 
That said, I turn to the submission that the claim against McMillan  by each member of the class might be unique and require an individual trial and, therefore, their distinct claims do not comprise a common issue for the purposes of s. 6(1)(c).
In my view, the Chambers judge made no error in his interpretation of the applicable law or the evidence before him, or in his application of the law to the relevant facts before him, which would warrant leave being granted based on arguments advanced by McMillan.
In conclusion, I dismiss both applications for leave with costs to be costs in the cause.
Dated at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 8th day of January, A.D. 2013.
          Klebuc C.J.S.","The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan.
The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan.
McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website.
The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency.
The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence.
McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client.
Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors.
The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors.
The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act.
HELD: The Court dismissed the applications.
It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious.
The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case.
McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client.
The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class.
McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence.
These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","[0, 98, 96, 3, 2, 93, 95, 1, 97, 6, 4, 94, 92]"

The Administrative Judge made no error when he said the parties were agreed on a common database because that is exactly what MLG requested in its Prayer for Relief.
Further, I see no issue of importance requiring the attention of the Court on the issue of the evidence or information upon which the Administrative Judge relied.
Both parties relied on hearsay evidence and an application for directions is simply an informal procedural step to ensure the verification process moves along.
The prospective appellant fails to establish there is a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings before the Court, or to the field of practice or the state of law, or to the administration of justice generally to warrant a determination by the Court.

The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants.
The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements.
In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed.
When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate.
The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement.
They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions.
The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program.
Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees.
Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them.
Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority.
In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan.
Leave to appeal was denied.

The Attorney General and provincial director must be mindful of the rights of the young person in any decision-making process which affects the liberty of a young person.
Such is the case in the event of an application for continuation pursuant to s. 98.
The application should be communicated clearly and in a timely fashion.
The young person must be advised of his right to consult with and be represented to a lawyer on the application.
The notice of the application should be served in a reasonable time prior to the expiry of the custody portion of the sentence.
It should clearly and concisely provide the young person with sufficient information so that he/she knows what is at stake so that a reasoned decision may be made in response.
Parliament has developed a scheme which calls for a community reintegration period in any sentence.

June 11, 1996          This motion raises the question of the right of a corporate board to breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government sponsored community bond program in order to establish its business.
FACTS          Precision Metal Fabricating Ltd. (""Precision"") entered into a Financing Agreement with Rosetown and District Community Bond Corporation (""Bondco"") March 14, 1991, under the terms of which Bondco invested $800,200 in Precision.
The purpose of the order now made is to place him on notice that the will of the shareholders and the contracts under which the company was formed are not to be brushed aside.
I am not directing the closure of the Saskatoon operation.
If it is the will of the board elected pursuant to the above order to withdraw from Saskatoon, it may do so.          Bondco shall be entitled to recover its taxable costs against the individual respondents.                                                             J.","The question was whether a corporate board could breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government sponsored community bond program in order to establish its business.
The Shareholders' Agreement obliged all shareholders to vote their shares so as to confirm the nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard for its performance.
As a result the board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though the Government of Saskatchewan and Bondco were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the company, they could not change the board and did not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes.
Members of Bondco were concerned that jobs were being obtained in Saskatoon at the expense of Rosetown jobs and the economic spin-offs expected from their $800,000 investment were not being realized in Rosetown due to the opening of the Saskatoon facility.
An application was brought under s234 of the Business Corporations Act.
They sought a restraining order enforcing the covenant, an order appointing new directors, an order of compensation for breach of contract and an order directing the closure of the Saskatoon operation and the return of company assets to Rosetown district unless Bondco granted written consent.
HELD: It was ordered that 1)the Shareholders Agreement was amended deleting the offending paragraph concerning the Board of Directors and substituting a new paragraph; 2)certain provisions of the Articles of Continuance as amended were suspended until the Termination Date; 3)the present board was suspended pending the election of directors at a special meeting of shareholders; 4)the respondent was enjoined from moving its operations and from transferring or hiring employees at any place other than Rosetown District unless Bonco's written consent was filed with the Court.
5)The Chief Executive Officer was not displaced nor was the Saskatoon operation directed to be closed.
 6)Bonco was entitled to its taxable costs against the individual respondents.","[44, 43, 42, 0, 1]"

It is also worth noting that the trial judge reviewed the circumstances under which Mr. Holoboff made his statement to police and underlined that he had a reason to lie.
In sum, we are not persuaded that the trial judge’s remarks would have unduly or improperly influenced the jury’s assessment of Mr. Holoboff’s credibility.
B.         The Sentence Appeal
Mr. Horkoff acknowledges that the sentences imposed on him fall within the standard range of sentences for similar offences.
He did suggest, however, that certain personal circumstances warrant his period of incarceration being reduced to time served.
We are not persuaded by these submissions.
Conclusion
In the end, we are not persuaded that, either individually or collectively, the concerns raised by Mr. Horkoff warrant his convictions being set aside on the basis they were unreasonable or not supported by the evidence.
Further, the sentences imposed by the trial judge were not demonstrably unfit.
The conviction appeals and the sentence appeals are dismissed.","The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora.
They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo.
The search revealed marijuana grow-op.
The accused was later seen by officers driving.
The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot.
Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial.
The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial.
He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison.
The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence.
HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.
The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op.
The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility.
The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","[150, 151, 0, 149, 3, 1, 148, 2, 146, 4, 147, 145, 6, 144, 5, 7, 142, 9, 143, 8]"
443,"The relief sought is divorce, division of matrimonial property, maintenance and costs.
FACTS          The parties were married on July 23, 1960 when they were both 19 years of age.
They separated on December 10, 1991.
This action was commenced on August 10, 1993.
They have two adult children, a son and a daughter, who are both self-sufficient.          At the time of the marriage Mrs. Protz's occupation was that of key punch operator.
After the marriage she continued to work in that vocation.
With the exception of a 7-week period after the birth of their son in 1961, Mrs. Protz worked full time until their son was 5 years old.
At this time their daughter was born.
They had lived in Regina to that time.
I am mindful of the distribution of matrimonial property that I have ordered.
The first of such payments is to be made on the June 1, 1996 and on the 1st day of each month during the currency of this provision.

The respondent admitted to having two different financial reports prepared in 1992 for his company of which he was sole Director and shareholder.
The company's accountant had been fined for preparing a false report and the respondent was being audited by Revenue Canada.
The false report had been submitted to the Court for valuation of the company.
HELD: 1)The testimony of the son who had worked for the respondent until fired for allegedly disclosing information to the mother was accepted over that of the respondent.
2)All assets were valued as the same time, the time of the application.
The midpoint of the valuations was used to value the respondent's interest in the company at $192,727.00.
3)The petitioner was to receive the balance of the proceeds of the sale of the matrimonial home plus $13,500 to equalize for monies paid to clear off the respondent's writ of execution.
4)Any interest accrued on the sale of the matrimonial home was to be divided equally.
5)The petitioner received her automobile, RRSP and bank account.
6)She was given judgment against the respondent for $135,982.00 with a charge against the matrimonial assets to be registered at Land Titles.
7)$84,000 of the respondent's RRSP was transferred by way of spousal roll over to the petitioner.
8)$12,000 of the settlement proceeds from the wrongful dismissal claim were to be assigned and paid out to the petitioner.

Now to be decided is whether the order should be confirmed as an order of this court, or whether it should be terminated or varied in its terms.          The Victims of Domestic Violence Act came into force on February 1, 1995.
It is a novel piece of legislation intended to protect domestic antagonists from violence one against the other and, in an emergency, to provide immediate relief from a turbulent predicament.          The Act provides for two types of orders.
Not until s. 7 does the procedure for obtaining a victim's assistance order appear.
Is there to be a hearing de novo?
Some definition of the process may be necessary to establish the parameters of the court's authority on a rehearing.
However, I leave that for a day when there is the benefit of argument from counsel.          No one appeared on this rehearing and it is even unclear whether the parties were given notice.
Nonetheless, I am satisfied that the order should not stand.
At the time of its making there was no urgency necessitating any extraordinary action.
The order will terminate forthwith.                                                             J.","The Respondent and the Applicant had a violent argument after which the Applicant and the child left the matrimonial home and moved to Transition House.
The Applicant sought and obtained an emergency intervention order under The Victims of Domestic Violence Act from a Justice of the Peace giving her exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home and restraining her husband from having any contact with her or their daughter during the currency of the order.
This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review.
The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section.
The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered.
HELD: Order vacated.
 1)An emergency intervention order is granted by a Justice of the Peace under s.3 of the Act without notice to the person whose conduct it restrains and without any representations from that person or on that person's behalf.
It is an extraordinary remedy to be granted only where serious and urgent circumstances indicate a need for prompt action to protect the victim. 2)Absent such urgency, the application should be one for a 'victim's assistance order' brought to a Queen's Bench Judge in Chambers under s.7 in accordance with The Queen's Bench Rules.
3)In this case the domestic violence complained of occurred on January 28.
There was no evidence that on February 1, 1995, Dolgopol was at risk of immediate harm.
There was by then no element of urgency and the application for relief should have awaited the regular Queen's Bench Family Law Division chamber sittings.
 4)The Court commented that it was unclear whether this rehearing was to proceed de novo or as a review but determined that the order should not stand in any event and therefore terminated it forthwith.","[72, 71, 70, 69, 2, 68, 66, 0, 3, 7]"

Ms. Sinclair filed a Notice of Appeal alleging certain facts with respect to why the order ought not to have been made.
Mr. Webb applied pursuant to Rule 46.1(1) of the Court of Appeal Rules to quash the Notice of Appeal on the basis that the Notice of Appeal was entirely without merit by reason that there was evidence before the Court and no factual basis on which the appeal could have been brought, heard and disposed of.
Rather than filing a Notice of Appeal, Ms. Sinclair should have pursued a remedy in the Court of Queen’s Bench.
The proper procedure for Ms. Sinclair to have followed was to return to the Court of Queen’s Bench and to apply pursuant to Rule 271 of the Queen’s Bench Rules to have the matter opened up and disposed of on the basis of evidence.
The application under Rule 46.1(1) to quash must proceed in two stages in as much as a single judge cannot quash an appeal pursuant to that Rule.  
In the circumstances, this matter is adjourned sine die with leave to bring the matter back before me on five days notice should the proposed appellant Ms. Sinclair be unsuccessful in the Court of Queen’s Bench.

            With all respect, I cannot agree.
I agree with cases such as Bzowey and Beutler to conclude that there has been no material change demonstrated.
In this case, there is a strong indication that at the time the decision was made in 2005, Jill had expressed a desire to try living with her mother.
She now expresses this desire in stronger terms, but it is not a change.
            These children were born, have grown up, and continue to live, go to school and have friends in Nipawin.
There is no information before the court to suggest that this is no longer in the best interests of these children.
            I find that as no material change has been demonstrated, this application must be dismissed.
The order shall further be varied to increase the amount of child support being paid by Susan from $559 per month to $619 per month, and the proportionate share of s. 7 expenses shall raise from 41% to 43% for Susan.
            There shall be no order as to costs in this matter.

HELD: 1)
The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12.
In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child.
There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother.
It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed.
Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2)
The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated.
It may well be that the child truly does wish a change.
It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent.
3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order.
There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children.
No material change has been demonstrated.

[2]               On March 30, 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties’ incomes and providing for ongoing support for Brett of $129 per month.
It is difficult to justify a situation that would provide support for one child but not the other.
This is not a situation where a long time has passed.
This would result in a decrease in her income and may actually provide a benefit to her in the form of reducing her tax.
Conclusion
There shall be an order that Mr. Gore-Hickman’s payment of $670 per month to Ms. Hubbard for the support of Brett terminate effective August 1, 2004.
There shall be an order that Ms. Hubbard’s child support obligation to Brett which was fixed by the fiat of March 30, 2005 at $129 per month shall be retroactive to August 1, 2004.

In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month.
The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive.
HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.
 1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court.
In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2)
The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met.
If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3)
By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him.
The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her.
There was no justification for the payment to continue.
It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.","[262, 263, 1, 0, 4, 3, 5, 2, 258, 7, 260, 8, 6, 9, 256, 259, 253, 250, 13]"

A viva voce hearing was directed.
                               BACKGROUND INFORMATION
[2]                                      According to Rocky, he and Shauna started living together on an acreage five miles south of Flaxcombe, Saskatchewan, on July 12, 1994.
Two children were born of that relationship: 
Neither parent suggested changing Kailey’s primary residence from Rocky’s home.
At present there exists a de facto split custody situation.
                                 POSITION OF EACH PARENT
The evidence is that Tyson interacts mainly with Kailey when on access visits to Rocky’s home.
                                              CONCLUSION
                            It is clear to me that the only viable options at this time are to either permit Shauna to relocate Tyson to the Archerwill district or to change the primary residence of Tyson by placing him in the home of Rocky.
Shauna has foreclosed the option of returning to live in the Kindersley district.
Too many irreversible events have taken place.
Access and child support issues may be returned to me for orders or directions at the request of either party.
Each parent shall keep the other provided with health, educational progress and extracurricular activity information relating to the child in that parent’s home.
There shall be no order as to costs.
D. K. KRUEGER","The respondent applies to vary the consent joint custody order granted in October 2004.
His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson.
The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson.
HELD: 1)
The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent.
This also requires a change in access arrangements.
These are changes in circumstances that are material.
 2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson.
The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey.
After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child.
Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis.
Even telephone access has been sporadic.
Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3)
The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation.
The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support.
4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson.
It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to.

449,"The respondent, under the provisions of The Education and Health Tax Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. E-3, as am. (the ""Act"") and The Department of Revenue and Financial Services Act, S.S. 1983, c. D-22.02 as am. S.S. 1988-89, c. 42, s. 29 amending the title and chapter of the Act to read The Revenue and Financial Services Act, c.

Husky appealed to the Board which upheld the assessment.          The appeal to this Court arises under s. 21 of The Revenue and Financial Services Act which provides, in part: 21(1)
Subject to subsection (2), a person aggrieved by a decision of the board made pursuant to section 20 may appeal to the court.
There is no guideline or criteria for the taxing authority to apply.
If the word ""published"" were intended to qualify the preceding words, then I would agree with Husky that an audience of one is sufficient.
This eliminates having to focus upon whether the audience is sufficiently broad which as noted, is anomalous when one considers its application to technical papers.
The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.          In conclusion, the appeal is allowed and the decision of the Board reversed.
The appellant shall have its costs of the appeal.                                                              J.","The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax.
Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges.
The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications.
The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately.
The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f).
The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act.
At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax.
HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed.
Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature.
The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact.
2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.
 3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact.
There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement.
The words used are simple and ordinary.
It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience.
To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax.
The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.
 5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","[117, 116, 3, 115, 2, 113, 114, 1]"

The supervisor of the personal access shall be Ms. J. Laird or any other supervisor agreed to by the father and the mother.

N.G. Gabrielson","The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule.
The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment.
The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order.
The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody.
The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother.
The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes.
The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child.
The issues were as follows.
1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child?
2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon?
3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother?
HELD: Application allowed.
The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1)
The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child.
The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible.
As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case.
Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father.
2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse.
In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse.
3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply.
Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","[288, 284, 287, 281, 282, 1, 289, 3, 2, 0, 277, 4, 283, 276]"

Costs
Although I did not detect any animosity from the parties during their testimony, I did detect a lack of cooperation between counsel.
This is one of those files where it appeared that the holding of a trial, in fact, was a more efficient and cheaper method of coming to a conclusion regarding the issue of maintenance than ongoing negotiation or pre‑trial.
Each party achieved partial success in their approach before me, and as such no costs are awarded to either.
R.C. Mills","The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation.
Division of the matrimonial property is at issue.
The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments.
HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable.
In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000.
It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3)
Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income.
The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use.
It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4)
The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle.
He states the personal use of his truck is 10%.
The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle.
This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5)
The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners.
The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him.
His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis.
There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins.
There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership.
There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father.
This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation.
This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase.
There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically.
There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term.
The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership.
6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year.
Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","[110, 111, 1, 0, 3, 2, 107, 4, 5, 108, 109, 6, 103, 7, 8, 105, 106]"

Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners.
The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners.
Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance.
The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment.
The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal.
The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal.
SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care.
HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed.
Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant.
The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian.
It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs.
There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian.
The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","[329, 331, 3, 0, 330, 2, 325, 7, 327, 328, 1, 11, 4, 10, 324, 326, 6, 320, 323, 322, 8, 12, 318, 5, 319, 317, 321, 316, 16, 9, 19, 315, 15]"

Caldwell J.A., in chambers
Shandel C. Wilson, on behalf of the appellant/respondent
In sum, given the facts of this matter, I can foresee no harm to the child or any significant disruption in his life if the stay is lifted.
However, as I noted in chambers, this means that the child is to have his access time with the father for the remainder of August, in accordance with the terms of the trial judge’s decision.
The mother acknowledged this to be the case.
[7]        Accordingly, I find it to be in the best interests of the child to lift the stay of execution imposed on the judgment under Rule 15(1).
This, of course, puts the incentive on the father to perfect his appeal, should he still wish to do so.
Finally, although I recognise that doing so has the potential to give rise to more problems than it may address, I also lift the stay of proceedings arising pursuant to Rule 15(4).
[8]        Costs shall be in the cause.
      DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 15th day of August, A.D. 2013.
                                     Caldwell J.A.","The respondent mother applied to lift the stay of execution imposed by Court of Appeal Rule 15(1) when the appellant father appealed the trial judge's decision to award custody of the parties' son to the mother with the child to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the school year (see: 2013 SKQB 212).
The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent.
As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother.
HELD: The Court granted the application.
There would be no harm to the child if the stay was lifted.
The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted.","[107, 0, 105, 2, 3, 1, 106, 4, 104, 102, 5, 100, 6, 101, 7, 8, 98, 99]"

The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation.
The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.
 2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities.
In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility.
It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review.
However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor.
The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","[218, 0, 217, 219, 3, 215, 216, 2, 1, 4, 7, 5, 6, 214, 213, 212, 9, 210, 8, 209, 211, 208, 11, 10, 207, 12, 14, 15, 206, 18, 13, 205, 16]"

Doug [doesn’t] want me to, so it’s my secret....
The school is equipped to provide resources for children with difficulties like Dylan’s.
[17]           The respondent, with the consent of the petitioner, did attend on Dr. Mathews in Saskatoon.
He suggests in his affidavit that when he attended on Dr. Mathews on October 16 that Dr. Mathews was not aware of the pending move to Edmonton.
I find that suggestion rather difficult to accept.
Attached to an affidavit is a letter dated October 1 from the petitioner to Dr. Mathews which sets out in some detail the planned move to Edmonton at the end of December.
[18]           In conclusion I am not persuaded that an order should issue prohibiting Dylan from moving to Edmonton to live with his father.
[19]           An application by the petitioner will be required, to vary the access arrangements with the respondent.
I am advised by counsel that such an application has now been served and will be heard in January.
[20]           The application is therefore dismissed with costs.","The respondent seeks an order prohibiting the petitioner from removing her son from Saskatchewan until she obtains a Court order allowing her to do so.
The child is the petitioner's son from a prior relationship.
The petitioner plans to have the child live with his biological father in Edmonton so that he can get the specialized medical care that he requires.
When the petitioner and the respondent separated, they consented to a judgment, which granted the petitioner custody of the child and gave access rights to the respondent.
The consent judgment provided that the petitioner was to provide the respondent with 90 days notice of any proposed change in the child's residence.
Notice of the upcoming move was provided to the respondent.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
The consent judgment does not require the petitioner to get an order before changing the child's residence.
An application will be required by the petitioner to vary the access arrangements with the respondent.","[53, 0, 1, 2, 52, 50, 3, 51, 4, 5, 49, 48, 6, 7, 46, 47, 8, 9, 45, 43]"

In the instant case, it appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported.
Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short period of time, that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused’s Charter rights.
It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching Shire’s vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where Shire was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle.
         Accordingly, the roadside demand was not made “forthwith” as required by s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code.
There was evidence from which the trial judge concluded that police officer was incorrect in conducting a warrantless search of Shire’s vehicle and detaining him in the police vehicle while he proceeded without advising Shire of his right to counsel.
The police officer chose otherwise.
Shire’s Charter rights were violated and the trial judge was correct in excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.
         Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
                                                                                                                               D.C. Hunter","The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code.
The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code.
At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately.
On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made.
The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed.
It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported.

It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle.
In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights.
The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","[133, 134, 135, 1, 136, 2, 0, 130, 131, 4, 3, 5, 126, 7, 125, 6, 127]"

Second, the sentence imposed did not reflect the gravity of the offence.
This was a serious fraud accomplished by virtue of what the Provincial Court judge called “a rather intricate kiting system.”
It involved a total of $24,000.00 which amount was lost by CIBC Visa.  
Third, public confidence in the criminal justice system would be undermined if there was no conviction on the facts at hand.
This offence was significant and should attract a criminal record.
In the result, leave to appeal is granted and a twelve month conditional sentence is substituted in place of the conditional discharge.
We prescribe the compulsory conditions set out in s. 742.3(1) of the Criminal Code and a further condition that Mr. Roberts perform 200 hours of community service work, with credit to be given in that regard for any such work performed to date pursuant to the probation order made by the sentencing judge.
The restitution order will remain in place.","The respondent was convicted after trial of fraud exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.
The trial judge granted him a conditional discharge with a probation order of 1 year and a requirement of 200 hours of community service work.
He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000.
The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service.
HELD: Appeal allowed orally.

With a different amount and a different nature, right, I could find it, I could come to a different resolve.
But in this particular case on these circumstances I’m not doing so, all right?[4]
I refer firstly to these provisions of the Act: 
“offence-related property” means, with the exception of a controlled substance, any property, within or outside Canada,
          (a) by means of or in respect of which a designated substance offence is committed,
          (b) that is used in any manner in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence, or
          (c) that is intended for use for the purpose of committing a designated substance offence;                                  [Emphasis added]
The following sections are relevant at this stage of the analysis:  
Before making an order under subsection 16(1) or 17(2) in relation to any property, a court shall require notice in accordance with subsection (2) to be given to, and may hear, any person who, in the opinion of the court, appears to have a valid interest in the property.
Where a court is satisfied that any person, other than

Ibid. at pp. 39-40.","The respondent was convicted of having in his possession a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and was sentenced to a term of incarceration of 9 months with a 10 year firearms prohibition.
The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them.
The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.'
HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal.
1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed.
2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed.
The truck is ordered forfeited.
1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.
 2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA.
It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence.
The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA.
Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration.
However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited.
The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person.
In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession.
The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so.
He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","[66, 0, 65, 64, 1, 63, 80, 2, 103, 3, 62, 4, 61, 5, 102, 81, 6, 82, 60]"

She received a death benefit for herself and for her two children.
Because she took issue with the calculation of the amount paid, her counsel applied for a review of the decision as provided by the Act.
The review by the respondent, Saskatchewan Government Insurance (""SGI""), gave the same results.
Once that calculation is made, which must be done,( because the death benefit for dependent children is an additional benefit the surviving spouse is entitled to), the same IRB calculation is used for the formula specified in s. 146(5).
To do so would create an unnecessary inconsistency within s. 146 itself.
Therefore, the preferable interpretation is the one that allows for s. 146 to work as a unit.
The IRB as calculated in ss. 146(5) is the same as the IRB for  in ss. 146(1).                      CONCLUSION      It is hereby ordered that SGI's decision is set aside.
SGI is directed to recalculate and pay Mrs. Korpess the death benefit to her as a surviving spouse and for her two dependent children in accordance with the directions of this court.

At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4.
HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.
 1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1).
There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit.
S146(1) is a self-contained formula.
3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1).
The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis.
4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1).
5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","[90, 89, 1, 88, 3, 87, 4, 2, 86, 83]"

GENEVIÈVE CLOUÂTRE
This prompted the tenant to request, in writing, an adjournment so that she could make arrangements to personally attend the hearing.
It was the tenant’s position that she was caught by surprise by this aspect of the hearing since no reference was made to this specific complaint in the landlord’s application.
Her materials point out that had she been aware that this issue would be raised and focused upon she would have had submissions to make including the fact that the boyfriend no longer presented a problem as he has since been and is presently incarcerated.

[4]               The Residential Tenancies Act 2006, S.S. 2006, c. R-22.0001 (the “Act”)
         In these circumstances I find and conclude with respect, that the tenant’s request for an adjournment was not properly considered by the Hearing Officer.
The disregard of the tenant’s request for an adjournment was unreasonable and inconsistent with the principle of access to justice that must guide judges and administrative tribunals alike in the conduct of their hearings.
                                                               DECISION

The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning.
She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally.
The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend.
HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date.
The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties.
This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted.
There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer.
Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing.
It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be.
On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend.
Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved.
The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process.
The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","[0, 69, 21, 74, 1, 20, 2, 50, 22, 68, 49, 65, 3, 23, 18]"

QUEEN’S BENCH FOR SASKATCHEWAN
October 17, 2011
The issue before the hearing officer concerned the tenants’ claim for damages and return of the security deposit arising out of the landlord’s notice to vacate.
Introduction
The building Manager, Don Dawson, will be in attendance at the hearing.
Analysis 
A.         Failure to Give Opportunity to be Heard and Respond to Claims
[11]           Under this ground of appeal, the landlord contends he was not given opportunity to be heard, or to adequately respond to the tenants’ claim.
[20]           While the hearing officer’s decision could have been more clearly worded, I conclude that a fair reading of the decision reflects an award for damages for both compensatory loss (loss of usable space) and aggravation and inconvenience.
Conclusion and Disposition
[21]           It is clear from the record that the landlord had notice of the application, the nature of the tenants’ complaint and the relief sought.
If the landlord had wished to personally attend, he could have sought an adjournment, but he did not.
of October 17, 2011 (2011 SKQB 386)

The tenants applied under the Residential Tenancies Act for the return of their security deposit and damages including moving expenses.
The landlord was out of country at the time of the hearing but authorized by letter that the caretaker would attend the hearing to represent the landlord.
The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment.
The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement.
The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision.
The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable.
HELD: The landlord's appeal was dismissed.
1) The tenant gave notice of his claim by two separate documents and the landlord showed no misapprehension of the tenants' position based on his written response.
The landlord did not indicate in his letter that the caretaker had a limited role and the landlord could have sought an adjournment but did not.
 2) Section 70(6)(c) of the Act empowers the hearing officer to order payment of damages where the hearing officer considers it just and equitable.
The wording of this provision is broad and unconstrained excepting that the nature of damages that may be imposed must not be punitive.
The decision on rent abatement was principled and to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space.
The award for moving costs was intended to compensate for inconvenience, aggravation and related expenses.
The awards were reasonable both in fact and law and no reviewable error was made by the hearing officer.

We are also of the view that the total sentence imposed in this case failed to give due weight to the aggravating factor that these offences were carried on in furtherance of a criminal organization.
Section 467.14 of the Criminal Code requires that the sentence imposed for this offence be consecutive to any other sentence imposed for the predicate offence.
Accordingly, the sentences imposed in these cases must be set aside.
In each case, an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and one year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment.
In this case, each of the respondents has already served five months of the conditional sentence imposed by the sentencing judge, for which they should be given credit.
Accordingly, the total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served.","The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition.
On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts.
They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party.
The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences.
The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature.
The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders.
The Court found the sentences must be set aside.
The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment.
HELD: The total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served.","[96, 0, 95, 93, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 90, 6, 7, 89, 94]"

The transcript of the proceedings is the official record.
• That on or about the 12th day of January, 2007 at or near Regina in the Province of Saskatchewan, they did with intent to commit an indictable offence, have their faces masked, contrary to s. 351(2) of the Criminal Code.
PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING
(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.
APPLICATION OF SENTENCING PRINCIPLES
In applying these principles, I consider the following factors to be aggravating:
• The robbery was committed against a person in a vulnerable position.
I will particularize the sentences as regards to each offence and each offender in a moment.
Having determined that the sentences will not be two years or less, it is not necessary for me to consider whether a conditional sentence would be appropriate.
In any event, I am also of the opinion, even if the global sentence had been less than two years, that conditional sentences would be inconsistent with the fundamental purpose and principles set out in s. 718 and 718.2 for these offences and these offenders.
THE SENTENCE
The victim surcharge will be waived in respect of each Mr. [J.L.P.] and Mr. [T.T.A.] in consideration of the fact that they have already been in custody for ten months.
G.A. Chicoine","The two accused were found guilty, after trial, of robbery with violence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code and wearing a mask with the intent to commit an indictable offence contrary to s. 351(2) of the Code.
HELD: The accused are sentenced to 40 months imprisonment for the offence of robbery with violence and 4 months consecutive for the offence of having their faces masked.
Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months.
The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary.
The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","[0, 14, 185, 115, 205, 183, 1, 204, 117, 182, 114, 184, 116, 98, 18]"

Concerning Jeanette, there are really no grounds upon which spousal support can be reduced below $400.00 monthly.
She does not seek an increase in spousal support.
Only that it remain the same as at the present time.
Given the employment and farming income of Terrance during 1993 revealed in his 1993 income tax return, I am not persuaded that he will not be able to continue making the support payments.
In the result, Terrance will pay to Jeanette for her support the sum of $400.00 per month and, as well, the sum of $800.00 and $400.00 per month for the maintenance of Michelle and Mark, respectively, for a total sum of $1,600.00, commencing the first of June, 1994.          An award for retroactive support and maintenance sought by Jeanette must be rejected.

CONCLUSION
The petitioner is entitled to forthwith register this judgment as a charge against the family home.","The wife sought distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act.
HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property.
The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced.
The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage.
It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor.
Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools.
While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck.
The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery.
There were no records of the value of the pigs.
Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals.
The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261.
The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt.
The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected.
Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred.
The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm.
The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt.","[264, 0, 22, 258, 1, 31, 23, 21, 261, 61, 32, 247, 257, 260, 60, 2, 97, 246, 20, 62, 33, 59, 237, 241, 98, 3, 127, 236, 96, 232, 63, 58, 19]"

Brian J. Scherman, Q.C.                                               for the plaintiff (applicant)
In the event the undertakings are complied with, the matter will proceed in the normal course.
         I have considered the matter of costs as requested by the plaintiff, and I am satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to her costs of the application and of the cross‑examination on July 22, 2005.
The plaintiff seeks solicitor‑and‑client costs in this regard; however, the plaintiff has not provided an indication of the approximate amount of such solicitor‑and‑client costs such as would enable the Court to assess whether an award of solicitor‑and‑client costs would be appropriate.
In the absence of this information, I am of the view that the appropriate award of costs to the plaintiff is that the plaintiff receive costs in an amount of double Column 4 in Schedule I “B”, being the tariff of costs in the Court of Queen’s Bench.
This order as to costs is made pursuant Rule 545(3)(e).
This order for costs is made against the defendant Peak Enterprises Inc., and such costs are to be payable by the defendant Peak Enterprises Inc. forthwith upon the assessment thereof by the Local Registrar.
G.N. Allbright","There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation.
The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules.
It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought.
The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation.
HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares.
Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment.
The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution.
Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares.
The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005.
The principal amount of her shares is $214,600.
It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment.
Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court.
The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act.
2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation.
The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings.
Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable.
3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129.
The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129.
Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement.
4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants.
5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","[182, 181, 178, 4, 180, 1, 0, 179, 183, 8, 177]"

Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue.
Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council’s decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation.
In the result, therefore, I find it unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process.

                                           HUNTER J.A.","These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation).
The referendum was held in the fall of 2005.
A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation.
The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect.
The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order.
They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions.
HELD: The appeals must be dismissed.
1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act.
He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign.
Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation.
The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation.
The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward.
An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary.
There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.
 2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case.
Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct.
The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section.
Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself.
3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum.
Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue.
Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation.

(Respondent on Cross-Appeal)
There are situations where the Government has the right to ask for additional information before agreeing to pay an account.
The Protocol is obviously an individualized administrative process.
However, I do not accept the argument that it is a “payment schedule” uniquely applicable to Dr. Huerto.
      C.     Unusual Service
Dr. Huerto says the ECG and Holter monitor procedures which are at the root of this appeal are standard tests and not “unusual” in and of themselves.
As a result, he contends they cannot validly attract an AU code.
His submission in this regard is based on s. 5(1)(j) of the Regulations.
Section 5(1) is set out below:
The minister may make payment to a person for insured services provided to a beneficiary where the person presents an account to the minister containing:
          (a) the full name of the patient;
          (b) the registration number of the patient;
          (c) the month and year of birth and the sex of the patient;
          (d) the location of services as follows:
          (e) the diagnosis or a diagnostic code prescribed by the minister;

                                     Wilkinson J.A.   ","This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients.
Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts.
The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided.
The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information.
He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts.
His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature.
The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success.
HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.
 1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'.
This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians.
The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts.
Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant.
The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule.
The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services.
This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'.
Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service.
This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service.
A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things.
3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act.
It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations.
An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code.
An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded.
These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment.
4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board.
The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts.
It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","[189, 190, 192, 193, 358, 191, 357, 0, 194, 4, 188, 3, 185, 1, 187, 197, 186, 355, 184, 356, 2, 195, 181]"

However, the respondent argues the presumption of an equal distribution is stronger in the case of a family home than for most family property.[10]
The trial judge refused to order an unequal division of the value of the home based on the gift.
He considered s. 22(1) and found:
The gift was made by the appellant's mother with the full knowledge the parties were living together.
They, the respondent and the appellant's mother, exchanged gifts at Christmas.
His mother made a similar gift to the appellant's sister who at that time was living with her boyfriend, (whom the daughter ultimately married).
Finally, the trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents.
In my view the trial judge made a finding the loans were statute barred.
He had this to say:
Although the trial judge uses the words ""collection of the loans appears to be statute barred…""
2004 SKCA 169 (CanLII); [2004]","This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act.
The couple had lived together for several years.
She sought judgment distributing their property.
The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents.
The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents.
The respondent appealed.
HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority.
Lane J.A. wrote in dissent.
Majority: 1)
The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship.
The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act.
There are a number of facts that merit emphasis.
The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started.
He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced.
He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced.
By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000.
2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property.
There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point.
The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete.
He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act.
On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property.
The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage.
Minority: 1)
The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act.
The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together.
In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2)
The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents.
He made a finding the loans were statute-barred.
The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent.
He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid.
He simply used less than precise language.","[517, 534, 558, 518, 3, 516, 7, 6, 0, 2, 513, 511, 4, 506, 8, 507, 502, 12, 1, 9, 15, 11, 10, 514]"

It follows that the appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall.
There will be judgment accordingly, dismissing the appeal in its entirety, with costs to the respondent, such costs to be taxed in the usual way. 
In leaving the case, we observe that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments.
They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee.
They were granted leave to appeal on the same grounds as those raised by HDL Investments.
Counsel for the companies agreed to treat the appeal by HDL Investments as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal.
So the other appeals are also dismissed, with costs in favour of the respondent, such costs to be taxed by the Registrar in accordance with the usual practice.

The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor.
The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board.
The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied.
It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act.
The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination.
The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties.

Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay a proportion of all the children’s extra-curricular activities.
This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require a variation in the order, or a new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities.
It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or a reasonable finding that a specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense.
Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and set aside the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay a proportion of the children’s extracurricular activities.
The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.

2001 SKCA 17 (CanLII), 203 Sask. R. 90.
Supra, note 1, s. 7(1.1)(b)(v).","This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act.
The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.'
The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines.
The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines.
It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses.
HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent.
Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring):
All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost.
Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent.
The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities.
Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application.
There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge.
Per Smith J.A. (in dissent):
Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders.
This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion.
In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines.
First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income.
There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion.
Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children.
In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all.
In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis.
Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities.
This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities.
It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense.
The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines.
Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside.
The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","[193, 191, 0, 192, 188, 1, 3, 187, 190, 7, 2, 4, 8, 6, 5, 184, 189, 183, 182]"

Donald H. Layh for the Appellant
James W.R. Taylor, Q.C. for the Respondent
As a result, the period of time over which “storage” costs should be assessed is quite uncertain.
I do not believe that unjust enrichment claims need be proven with precise mathematical certainty.
However, Gari has failed to present evidence which would allow the Court to meaningfully quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief.
As a consequence, I am of the opinion that no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument.
Gari also referred to the concept of the constructive trust in its pleadings.
However, it is not readily apparent how a trust would arise in the circumstances of this case and Gari quite properly did not press or develop that feature of its claim in argument before the Court.
      D.  The Cross-Appeal
In its cross-appeal, Gari argues that the trial judge erred in failing to award damages in the amount of $500 per month in respect of “rent”.
                                        LANE J.A.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA).
The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union.
The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest.
The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent.
The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
Cross appeal dismissed.
In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.
 1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures.
It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other.
There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so.
2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it.
Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA.
3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them.
The respondent's claims in this regard fail.
4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief.
As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument.
5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","[251, 231, 233, 232, 230, 229, 0, 3, 227, 228, 7, 2, 1, 4, 8, 226, 6, 5, 9]"

SASKATCHEWAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION and
CANADIAN UNION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES LOCAL NO. 21
         It is probably fair to say that Mr. Kivela did not fully appreciate exactly why he was not made permanent.
But the fundamental allegation is simply that both the City and CUPE discriminated against Mr. Kivela in relation to his employment because of his disability.
         As to accommodation, the Tribunal made the following finding:
While reasonable and acceptable, the accommodations do not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship.
Neither the City nor CUPE established their inability to accommodate Mr. Kivela in obtaining permanent employee status with the City in 16 years, or that their duty to accommodate would cause undue hardship.
I also find that the Respondents have not suffered prejudice having regard to the length of time that has passed, as has been suggested.
The duty to accommodate is a positive one, and an on-going obligation, imposing on the employer the duty to explore all possible accommodations available to the employee.
                                                          CONCLUSION
Costs may be spoken to. ","This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE.
It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent.
The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability.
The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE.
The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability.
The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination.
The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship.
The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability.
HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed.
The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal.
1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review.
If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness.
In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable.
Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies.
2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer.
The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions.
The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan.
The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000.
But by this time, he was unable to work.
3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others.
It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner.
4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant.
The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination.
The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory.
5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship.
6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence.
There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions.
Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant.
If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees.
Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous.
It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship.
7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct.
The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination.
The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","[276, 0, 487, 2, 1, 4, 271, 278, 277, 485, 274, 3, 7, 5, 268, 6, 269, 9, 8, 10]"

On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents.
That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents.
For these reasons, then, the appeal is dismissed to the extent it takes issue with Justice Rothery’s decision to withdraw the case from the jury.
As for her award of costs, we note that costs are in the discretion of the trial judge, that the discretionary power committed to trial judges in relation to costs is largely unfettered, and that the standard of review on appeal is decidedly narrow, all as mentioned in detail in Benson v. Benson (1994), 1994 CanLII 4554 (SK CA), 120 Sask. R. 17 (Sask C.A.).
Viewed in this light, we can see no tenable basis for interfering with the award.
Accordingly the appeal is dismissed in this respect as well.
It follows that the appeal is dismissed in its entirety.
The respondents shall have their costs on appeal, such costs to be taxed in the usual way. ","This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants.
The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants.
The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents.
In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents.
The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered.
Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns.
The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle.
In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury.
On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents.
That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents.
2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","[82, 0, 81, 80, 3, 1, 79, 2, 77, 76, 6, 75, 4, 78]"

Ian D. McKay, Q.C. for the Appellant
If she had manifested some unease after the signature and meeting but before the delivery, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances.
Here that matter is of no moment in determining the issue of the solicitor’s negligence.
Again, as with the attempts to set aside the contract, the claims against the solicitor are without a factual basis.
The trial judge again made the critical findings of fact.
These findings, including comprehension and a desire to provide a benefit to the Clements, are amply supported in the evidence, including the candid admissions of the appellant in her testimony at trial.
Accordingly, the appeals against both the Clements and the solicitors are dismissed.
Each will have costs against the appellant, but all of the Clements will receive one set of costs as will all the named solicitors.
2005 SCC 25 (CanLII), [2005]
Trial judgment, 2008 SKQB 1 (CanLII) at para.","This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent.
The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement.
The total price was $120,000.
The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year.
There was no interest.
However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes.
The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened.
The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence.
It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to.
2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract.
It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction.
The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract.
The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract.
If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances.
The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","[83, 0, 82, 80, 3, 1, 2, 81, 79, 78, 4, 77, 76, 7, 6, 5, 8, 75]"

The respondent’s evidence, accepted by the trial judge and unrelated  to the witness, was sufficient basis for determining that the onus of proof upon the appellant had not been met.
The trial judge was not required to accept the entirety of the witness’s testimony, despite having accepted most of it, particularly in light of the contradictory evidence of the respondent denying the sum claimed by the appellant.
Moreover, the denial by the respondent of the appellant’s claim, accepted by the trial judge, was fatal to the appellant’s onus of proving a mutual understanding and absolute acknowledgement of the alleged debt between the parties, a well established principle of jurisprudence: Larder v. Farquhar (1888), 20 N.S.R. 454 (C.A.); Armitage v. Vivian (1885), 1885 CanLII 177 (MB CA), 2 Man. R. 360 (C.A.); Bloomley v. Grinton (1851), 1 U.C.C.P. 309 (C.A.).
That principle of law and case authorities were not before the trial judge nor argued on this appeal.

[10]           The appeal is dismissed.

 [1]                It had been established that these two matters would be tried together and there are no substantive differences between the cases on the issues that determine the rights and obligations of the parties.
 [2]                Accordingly, this judgment applies to both Q.B.G. No. 1040/1998 and Q.B.G. No. 1041/98.
 [3]                There are two contracts that play in this case:
 [4]                The plaintiffs have constructed their cases in reliance upon the overall affect of both contracts with specific emphasis on the contract of January 21, 1997.
                                                    PRIVITY OF CONTRACT
For a determination of the case here I will look to see if the plaintiffs have made out the case that they have constructed.
 [22]               The plaintiffs have failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged on that breach and that any breach occurred.
                                                                  DAMAGES
 [24]               Even if the case on entitlement had been made out the damages could not have been properly determined without further evidence or representation.
                                                                   RESULT
 [25]               Accordingly, each case is dismissed.","This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants.
The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association.
The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract.
Both matters were tried together.
The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P.
HELD: Both actions were dismissed.
1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity.
While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association.
2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work.
The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference.
The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs.
They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.
 3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required.
The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.","[0, 1, 24, 25, 58, 57, 2, 31, 56, 50, 3, 4, 23, 26, 21, 20, 5, 49, 22, 19, 6]"

This is an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision of Arbitrator Ish interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and respondent.
The judgment centered on a clause governing retroactivity of pay: 
NOTE ON RETROACTIVITY
All employees on staff at September 3, 1999 shall be eligible for retroactive wage adjustments based on all paid hours with any employer.
Employees who have retired from any employer during the term of the agreement shall be eligible for retroactive wage adjustments based on all paid hours up to and including the date of retirement.
For this alternate ratio we agree with the conclusion of the chamber judge in the Court of Queen’s Bench.
That is, this interpretation was a possible interpretation as evidenced by the earlier analysis of Arbitrator Ish.  While it may not be the one that any of us would have chosen had we been given his choices at first instance, it is a possible interpretation on the analysis, legal and grammatical, of the entire agreement, and accordingly we cannot find that it is patently unreasonable.
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs in the usual way on double Column V.","This was an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision the arbitrator interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and the respondent.

Conclusion
            Mr. [E.H.] does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support.
Ms. [V.G.B.] shall have leave to bring this matter back before the Court once Mr. [E.H.] obtains employment or if he remains unemployed for a period of three moths.

            Ms. [V.G.B.]’s application for s. 7 expenses is dismissed with leave to bring the issue of child care and busing back before the Court once Mr. [E.H.] obtains employment.","This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support.
HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child.
The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support.
He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income.
1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment.
There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.
 2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'.
That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines.
The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning.
The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a).
The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","[2, 266, 269, 0, 1, 5, 263, 4, 270, 268, 3, 6, 7, 264, 9, 8, 11, 257, 261, 260]"

It is Appropriate for the Bankruptcy Court to Grant this Receiving Order          In my view there is evidence of no extenuating circumstances which would warrant the Court refusing to grant a receiving order.
He has the means to pay his debts and should be required to do so.          Therefore a receiving order shall issue.
The Extension of the Preservation Order          Evidence obtained at the cross-examination of Ashton establishes that the majority of his wealth is contained in the Securities purportedly ""seized"" by his wife, Susan Ashton, in the spring of 1996.
I therefore continue the preservation order for 30 days, in order to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to assess the situation, consult with the inspectors and determine whether or not the bankruptcy estate wishes to take action to challenge these transactions pertaining to the Securities.          Costs may be spoken to.                     ________________________________________ J.","Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them.
The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages.
The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them.
The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife.
HELD: A receiving order was granted.
1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations.
It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993.
The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.
 2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996.
The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","[2, 70, 69, 71, 66, 1]"
486,"For this reason I feel the consent judgment option under ss. 172(2)(c) of the Act is most appropriate, both for the doctors and the community they serve.          Having taken into consideration all of the foregoing, I order as follows: 1.In respect of the bankrupt, Dr. Dominic Eustace:          (a)If he consents to judgment there will be a judgment in favour of the trustee in the amount of $45,000.00 to apply to the unsecured claims.          (b)The judgment shall not be enforced so long as the bankrupt pays to the trustee the sum of $1,250.00 per month on the first day of each and every month commencing on the first day of April, 1996, and continuing thereafter on the first day of each month for a total period of 36 months.          (c)The judgment will not bear interest.          (d)The trustee shall apply the said payments firstly in payment of its reasonable fees and distribute the balance from time to time pro rata amongst the unsecured creditors.          (e)Upon the bankrupt consenting to this judgment, the bankrupt shall receive an absolute discharge. 2.In respect of the bankrupt, Dr. Veronica Ann Eustace:          (a)If she consents to judgment there will be a judgment in favour of the trustee in the amount of $45,000.00 to apply to the unsecured claim.          (b)The judgment shall not be enforced so long as the bankrupt pays to the trustee the sum of $1,250.00 per month on the first day of each and every month commencing on the first day of April, 1996, and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter for a total period of 36 months.          (c)The judgment will not bear interest.          (d)The trustee shall apply the said payments firstly in payment of its reasonable fees and distribute the balance from time to time to the sole unsecured creditor, Revenue Canada.          (e)Upon the bankrupt consenting to this judgment, the bankrupt shall receive an absolute discharge.                                                       C.J.Q.B.                                                   In Bankruptcy","Two doctors filed in bankruptcy in 1995 and in each case the major unsecured creditor was Revenue Canada.
Neither met the 50% threshold of ss.173(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and each likely committed one or more acts of bankruptcy under ss.(b) to (m).
However there was no suggestion of dishonesty.
The combined medical earnings in the four years prior to the bankruptcy averaged $18,000 per month and the after-tax family income averaged $10,200 per month.
HELD: A consent judgment under ss.172(2)(c) was ordered such that if each doctor consented to the payment of $45,000 to be paid at a rate of $1,250.00 per month for 36 months without interest there would be an absolute discharge.
1)The payments proposed by Revenue Canada of $3,349.00 per month were unreasonably high in all the circumstances.
2)Their contributions to the community did not relieve either doctor from making reasonable payments to the trustee as a condition of their discharge from the bankruptcy.",[19]

[6]Supra, Note 4.
[7]Supra, Note 12.","Two female employees filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination contrary to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code.
The unionized employer applied for judicial review in the nature of prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s.25 of the Trade Union with the result that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint.
The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship and granted an order prohibiting the Board of Inquiry from hearing and determining the matter.
Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount.
HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code.
1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment.
2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy.
Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions.
To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect.
3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement.
The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account.
It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.
 4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff.
No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25]
This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary.
The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts.
This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals.
For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment.
The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31]
One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator.
The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction.
It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction.
The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement.
To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.","[281, 207, 1, 280, 208, 0, 210, 279, 209, 278, 211, 275, 276, 213, 274, 212, 277, 214, 272, 215, 271, 216, 273, 270, 217, 218, 269, 219, 2, 268, 3, 206, 5, 205, 267, 4, 220, 204]"
488,"IN RE: THE MATTER OF JUDICIAL REVIEW PURSUANT
            One aspect of Wal-Mart Canada’s submission is that the Board has already interpreted s. 9 very broadly which establishes that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter.
First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted.
Second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW.
Wal-Mart Canada submits that it would be futile to remit the matter back to the Board for the determination of an issue that it has already been determined.
            I have already addressed and rejected this submission of Wal-Mart Canada in my conclusions reached in conjunction with the issues raised by the application to quash the Board orders.
I move on to address the other aspects of Wal-Mart Canada’s Charter application.
To provide some context for my conclusions, I begin by reproducing the relevant statutory provisions.
            Section 9 of The Trade Union Act reads as follows:
advice n. 1 recommendation on how to act.
In so doing they expedited the applications and their resolution by the Court.","Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board.
The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents.
Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done.
Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional.
HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW.
The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back.
1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.
 2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness.
3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects.
First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce.
The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced.
There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy.
It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed.
Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents.
The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it.
It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations.
4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did.
The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders.
The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.
 5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination.
It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6)
Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation.
Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue.
Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made.
7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal.
If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant.
The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.
 8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter.
Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways.
First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW.
If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights.
If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional.
However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","[398, 397, 395, 3, 392, 394, 459, 396, 393, 401, 390]"

When Thomas Davidson, Sr. sold his farm to his son, Thomas Davidson, Jr., in 1968, he retained the right to continue receiving the rentals arising from four surface leases which he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells.
When, in 1973, his son, Thomas Davidson Jr., granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff, as represented by his agent, the agreement contained the following paragraph: (11)
The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.          A number of arguments were put forth during the trial relating to privity of contract, the interpretation of the will of Thomas Davidson, Sr., estoppel and various other matters.
The plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.                                                             J.","When Davidson, Sr. sold his farm to his son he retained the right to continue receiving the rentals arising from four surface leases which he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells.
The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases.
There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement.
The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title.
HELD: Declaration denied.
Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs.
1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.
 2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him.
His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego.
This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act.
3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years.","[0, 27, 2, 25, 1]"

D E C I S I O N
The Tenant seeks to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to that clause quashed.
ISSUES
If not, was the arbitrator’s decision patently unreasonable in this case?
FACTS
Where an arbitrator or umpire has misconducted himself, or an arbitration or award has been improperly procured, the Court may set aside the award.
With respect to the rest of his decision, I conclude that it was within his jurisdiction to deal with those issues.
It is therefore not patently unreasonable.
Insurance Coverage for Repeated Damage
At p. 25 of his decision, the arbitrator found as follows:
He therefore gave to clause 3.04 an interpretation which was not patently unreasonable.
There is a rational basis to support his conclusion.
Lack of Notice
The appellants say that the arbitrator concluded, with no evidence before him, that the Tenant had to notify the Landlord of damage.
There is a rational basis for this conclusion evident from his decision.
CONCLUSION
The application is dismissed with respect to the rest of the arbitrator’s decision.
COSTS
There has been mixed success, but I will accept written submissions from the parties if they cannot agree on costs.","A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage.
The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease.
The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity.
The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision.
Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision.
The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel.
Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable.
The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","[7, 0, 499, 500, 8, 501, 22, 497, 496, 18, 17, 479, 478, 480, 438, 23, 437, 477, 436, 138, 46]"

IN THE MATTER OF:
Counsel also points to the deemed privative clause provisions under s. 42(2) of the Trade Union Act and to s. 5(h) of the Arbitration Act.
WAS THE ARBITRATOR’S AWARD PATENTLY UNREASONABLE?
The Supreme Court of Canada has on a number of recent occasions endorsed a policy of judicial restraint with respect to the review of decisions of consensual arbitrators.
As reiterated in Safeway, this is a very high standard which will not easily be met.
The arbitrator briefly alluded to this at page 13-14 of her award when she posed the question:  
Further, if Ms. MacMaster was out on extended sick leave, and her date of return was not clearly anticipated, should the Grievor be in effect penalized upon her return?
The question to be asked is whether Article 9:01 can reasonably be given an interpretation that has the potential to detrimentally affect employees returning from maternity leave, depending on their standing of seniority.
In my view, it cannot.
CONCLUSION
The applicant hotel is also entitled to its costs of the application which are hereby fixed in the amount of $1500 plus taxable disbursements.","The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave.
The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority.
The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority.
The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review.
Application allowed;
the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside.
The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision.
Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.","[2, 0, 94, 169, 168, 176, 170, 7, 93, 97, 95, 4, 166, 165]"

Appellant
Justice Goodfellow did not explicitly adopt this reasoning but arguably it is implicit in his determination that the litigation in Marineserve had not “progressed out of the starting gate”.
That was Justice Goodfellow’s factual finding in the context of exercising his discretion.
In contrast, Justice LeBlanc here found that Mr. Newton had filed a substantive defence and taken steps in the proceeding.
The evidence supports these findings.
Therefore, the remedy of a stay under s. 7 of the Arbitration Act was no longer available to Mr. Newton.
In light of the foregoing, it is not necessary to decide whether there is a meaningful distinction between proceeding under Rule 4.07 for dismissal for want of jurisdiction or Rule 88.02 for abuse of process, which was the equivalent 1972 Rule (14.25(d)) invoked in Marineserve.

A decision on the corollary issue of whether the proceeding should have taken place under Rule 4.07 (dismissal for want of jurisdiction) or Rule 88.02 (abuse of process) is unnecessary.","[0, 21, 22, 111, 23, 110, 108, 1, 20, 24, 25, 106, 105, 107, 26, 28, 27, 104, 19, 109]"

Under such circumstances it would be appropriate to apply that rule in Dearle v. Hall.
However, where a debtor has actual notice of more than one assignment prudence may dictate that the debtor not rely on the rule in Dearle v. Hall but should retain the funds to pay the debt until the competing claims have been resolved.
As mentioned previously, the Agreed Statement of Facts does not seem to accord with the documents giving rise to the claims of Martin and Eastland.
Without going into details both Martin and Eastland's assignments were described as absolute assignments; the actual documents upon which they rely do not appear to warrant this interpretation.

Martin's appeal was successful on the issue raised under the Indian Act but it failed on the priorities issue.
Eastland also failed on this key issue.

Appellant
Respondent
REASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY: HALLETT, J.A.","This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve.
Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants.
The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band.
He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1).
He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them.
The appellants appealed.
Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act,
that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans.

Docket: CA 287370
Registry: Halifax
Appellant
This is because a stay of execution, in common with interim injunctive relief, must justly apportion the risk of uncertainty about the ultimate outcome of the case.
There are arguable issues raised on appeal, but one cannot at this stage speculate about what the outcome of the appeal will be.
The risk created by this uncertainty is shared by both the appellant and the respondents.
If a stay is granted and the appeal ultimately fails, the respondents will have been kept out of their money needlessly.
If, on the other hand, the stay is denied and the appeal ultimately succeeds, the appellant will have been required to pay the judgment needlessly.
In this case I see no obvious or egregious errors in the decision under appeal, and as indicated above, issuing a stay does not impact upon the Texan proceedings and there is no pending execution order to be stayed.
This is not a case where issuing a stay would prevent an injustice.
Having considered the submissions made in this case, I am not persuaded that any exceptional circumstances exist here.
I dismiss the application for a stay pending appeal.
Costs of this application will be in the cause.","Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas.
He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding.
The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision.
She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here.
She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned.
Application for stay pending appeal dismissed;
the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here.
Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there.
Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20.","[135, 0, 136, 1, 134, 131, 133, 132, 130, 2, 129, 128, 3, 5, 127]"

V.      ANALYSIS
Did the Agency fail to disclose relevant information to the respondent, L.M., and to the court?
[80]        Section 38(1) of the Children and Family Services Act provides for mandatory disclosure by the Agency subject to a privilege claim:
       Disclosure or discovery
Subject to any claims of privilege, an agency shall make full, adequate and timely disclosure, to a parent or guardian and to any other party, of the allegations, intended evidence and orders sought in a proceeding.
Given the breath and extent of the “error”, it is necessary to review this issue in further detail.
K.B. shall also participate in a psychological assessment so that the court receives a comprehensive  picture of her needs.
I recognize that K.B. is more defiant than C.B., however such only increases the need for intense services.

VI.            ADDENDUM
As a result, no costs are awarded.","Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies.
Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history.
There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down.
The mother now sought the return of both children.
The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect.
Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation.
Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency.
Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately.
The mother continued to require professional intervention.","[0, 16, 503, 498, 15, 497, 17, 488, 1, 20, 25, 2, 487, 311, 310, 486, 312, 14, 313, 316, 314]"

If this organization has kept records of every conversation the Respondent has had with staff, the records may contain significant irrelevant information.
I do consider it important to consider the Respondent’s right to privacy in respect to the production of irrelevant information.
The relevant information must be produced notwithstanding the Respondent’s wish to keep it private.
However, it is not necessary to produce all the records.
This organization may be requested to prepare a report, or interrogatories may be used in respect to the identified barriers, the recommendations made, the Respondents follow through and the plan she prepared prior to her leaving the Centre.
Since the Minister is requesting all records in its Order of Production I deny the request.
Beryl MacDonald, J.","The Minister sought numerous orders for production of medical and various other files (including the mother's complete medical files from her family physician, the Nova Scotia Hospital and another hospital, and her files from a woman's shelter and an addiction treatment and prevention service) in an ongoing child protection proceeding.
The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest.
The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means.
In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care.
Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances.
Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings.
However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding.
Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","[8, 10, 0, 9, 11, 263, 260, 264, 261, 259, 14, 16, 13, 257, 262, 17, 18]"

PUBLISHERS OF THIS CASE PLEASE TAKE NOTE THAT s. 94(1) OF THE CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT APPLIES AND MAY REQUIRE EDITING OF THIS JUDGMENT OR ITS HEADING BEFORE PUBLICATION.  
SECTION 94(1)
No person shall publish or make public information that has the effect of identifying a child who is a witness at or a participant in a hearing or the subject of a proceeding pursuant to this Act, or a parent or guardian, a foster parent or a relative of the child.
Reasons for judgment:
[1]              The appellant, L. D. F., a single mother, appealed the November 26, 2004 decision of Justice Douglas MacLellan, refusing to grant her the adoption she sought with respect to her four year old daughter.
At the conclusion of the hearing before us we indicated the appeal was dismissed with reasons to follow.
It is clear from his decision that the chambers judge understood that the primary consideration in an application for adoption is the best interests of the child and that he identified and weighed several factors in deciding this.
His comment that ""knowing your natural parents is a benefit"" was not determinative.
He made no reversible error in exercising his discretion in refusing to grant the adoption.
Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed.
Concurred in:","The chambers judge refused to grant an adoption to a single mother of her own daughter as he determined that the child would not gain anything vis a vis the mother by such an adoption but would lose the potential for a relationship and support from her father.
The evidence before the chambers judge was meagre but showed that the father had not seen the child for the past four years.
The mother appealed.,
appeal dismissed;
the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act.
He did not place too much emphasis on the child's loss of a potential relationship with and support from the father on the facts of this case.","[0, 4, 13, 97, 96, 14, 95, 93, 94, 16, 17, 18, 15]"
498,"Because the trial is scheduled to start tomorrow, I have had no opportunity to reserve, other than for a few hours.
I would have preferred to have expanded on my reasons.
This case involves a child protection proceeding in respect of a child who was under the age of six when taken into care.
There was delay in the proceeding for a number of reasons.
The primary child protection concerns that were being advanced and alleged by the agency were such that the original agency planning for the reunification of the mother and child required some psychological counselling for the mother and child.
In the present case, I granted the time extension to the trial date.
The trial has not yet been conducted.
The best interests of the child has not yet been determined.
The appropriate disposition has not been determined and after the trial, I will have only two options under this statute and they are to terminate the proceedings or to make a
permanent care order.
Any attempt after the trial to make a continued intervention order of any type would not be possible in my view.
In conclusion, the Court has not lost its jurisdiction in this matter and the trial will commence tomorrow.","The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction.
No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties.
The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel.
Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed.
The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial.
When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act.
When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date.","[111, 110, 12, 108, 14, 109, 13, 15, 105, 106, 16, 107]"

Corrine E. Sparks, J.F.C.","Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances.
When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care.
The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability.
The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time.
The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children.
Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication.","[0, 236, 237, 1, 234, 2, 231, 235, 233, 3, 5, 4, 228, 8, 230, 226, 9, 227, 10, 11, 6]"
500,"[1]              R.B. applies to me in Chambers for an order that she be added as a party so that she can appeal a permanent care order respecting her granddaughter.
She says she had indicated to the Society that she was willing to be considered as a placement for the child if the plan to return the child to her mother did not progress as anticipated.
In the end, the proceedings resulted, in June of this year, in an order placing the child in the permanent care and custody of the Children’s Aid Society of Halifax.
This would add to delay which the Children and Family Services Act tries to avoid.
While there might be particular circumstances in which a judge of this Court, if he or she had jurisdiction, would make the order sought, there is nothing in the material filed that would persuade me to do so in this case.
I should add that it is apparent from the material filed that there are a number of issues of fact surrounding R.B’s involvement with the child and the proceedings as well as the Society’s communications with her.
Nothing which I have said in these reasons should be taken as deciding any of these factual issues.
In the result, the application is dismissed.","The applicant grandparent applied to the Court of Appeal to be made a party to the proceeding so that she could appeal a permanent care order made in respect of her granddaughter.

a judge of the Court of Appeal in Chambers does not have the authority to make the order requested; in any event, an application in the Family Division for leave to terminate the permanent care order would be a more appropriate way for the applicant to proceed.","[19, 76, 75, 73, 74, 22, 72, 21]"

ANALYSIS
Statutory provisions
[63]This application is governed by section 48 of the Children and Family Services Act, particularly ss. (6).
Termination of permanent care and custody order
An order for permanent care and custody terminates when
(b) the child is adopted;
(d) the court terminates the order for permanent care and custody pursuant to this Section.
My findings relate only to the leave application, not to the result of any eventual termination application.
Whether the parents will indeed succeed in establishing that the order should actually be terminated is not for me to decide at this stage.
[95]On the threshold issue of whether the parents should be granted leave to apply to terminate the permanent care and custody order, I am satisfied that the best interests of the children will be best served by allowing the parents’ application.
[96]I have not addressed the issue of access in this decision.
I am not willing to order access at this time, on the evidence before me.
To establish whether access with the parents would be in the children’s best interests requires further evidence.
[97]The applicants’ counsel shall prepare the Order accordingly.
I refer counsel to Civil Procedure Rule 69.
In view of the nature of the issues and the best interests of the children, I urge counsel to see that this matter proceeds as quickly as possible.","The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children.
Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard.
The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency.
Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders.
Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed.
Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling","[608, 607, 323, 605, 606, 0, 322, 324, 603, 321, 325, 604, 601, 329, 327, 600, 602]"

Patricia Reardon, Esq., for the Respondent, F.M.
The agency, in its plan of care, supports alternative placement with the paternal grandmother.
In order to determine which is the workable plan in the best interests of the child, there are a number of factors to be looked at with respect to the benefits or weaknesses of both parties.
Paternal Grandmother
There are three negatives that should be considered; the senior age of the proposed custodian, her past parenting ability and the fact no other children or siblings reside in her home.
The Maternal Grandmother
She is 45 years old and lives in [the Halifax Regional Municipality] and lives with her son who is 18 years of age.
The child (D.’s brother) lives there as she has custody of him.
John D. Comeau
Chief Judge of the Family Court
for the Province of Nova Scotia","The mother was unable to care for the child and the father, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was only entitled to supervised access.
Both the paternal and maternal grandmothers presented plans of care to the court, with the paternal grandmother seeking custody and the maternal grandmother seeking care and control of the child.
The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother.
The Agency supported the paternal grandmother.
Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents.
The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody.
The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them.","[0, 129, 18, 161, 7, 160, 130, 122, 8, 115, 128, 131, 159, 121]"

The mother reported the child had foot and mouth disease and had been burned on her back from a heater.
In December the mother reported to the agency that she was not returning to Cape Breton for court and requested the file be transferred to the Halifax area.
By early January the Respondent psychological father and mother were still residing in Cape Breton.
The January 5th hearing was adjourned to January 26, 2005 for the reception of evidence regarding the Respondents progress and their circumstances.
The agency was concerned that the Respondent mother and psychological father were not prepared to cooperate with the agency in addressing the risk factors which affected the health and safety of their child and were more concerned about their own circumstances than the child's needs.
The biological father's application for standing was granted on September 15, 2005.
BIOLOGICAL FATHER:
The biological father's lack of commitment to the child prior to February 2005 raises questions about his long-term commitment to care for the child.
Section 47 (2) provides:
The Court is satisfied that this limited access Order will not impair the child's future placement for a permanent placement in a family setting given the child's young age.
                                                         DARRYL W. WILSON, J.","The Agency applied for permanent care of a young child, with no access to the parents.
Each of the mother, the biological father and the psychological father sought to have the child placed in their care.
The child had been apprehended due to unsafe and unhealthy living conditions.
The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses.
The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child.
The mother was against this plan.
The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father.
Child placed in the permanent care of the Agency with no access to the mother or the psychological father; access ordered to the biological father for a period of six months at which time the access order will expire automatically unless an application to vary is made; the Agency is to arrange for a parental capacity assessment of the biological father.
The child continued to be at substantial risk of physical harm due to neglect if she was returned to the mother's care and the child would be at risk of exposure to violence if returned to the psychological father's care due to the tumultuous relationship between the mother and him.
Although some improvements had recently been made in the mother's life, she had a history of frequent changes of residence and did not appear able put the child's needs ahead of her own.
The Agency had not had an opportunity to assess the appropriateness of a placement with the biological father.","[434, 85, 84, 0, 1, 456, 455, 433, 2, 83, 82, 121, 418, 3, 4, 86]"
504,"IN THE YOUTH JUSTICE COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA
By the Court:
Counsel for The Chronicle Herald and the Daily News take the position that this is a public proceeding to which they should have access.
Application of s. 132 of the YCJA:
Under the first prong of the test set out in s. 132  I am to determine whether the presence of the public and the media is unnecessary to the conduct of proceedings.
Here access is being sought to a process which has yet to produce any information or record.
And there is a very real risk that should the public and the media be permitted to attend this process, the process itself will be rendered useless and will fail to produce any meaningful information or record.
A comment was made by counsel on behalf of the media to the effect that it is not appropriate for a conference to hinge on the cooperation of a young person.
This is in my view, a reasonable limit on the open court principle, all things considered.
An order is granted pursuant to s. 132 of the YCJA excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference in relation to T.C. scheduled for December 11, 2006. ","A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference.
The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence.
Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present.
Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press.
Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media.
The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth.
There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","[15, 0, 318, 332, 245, 18, 317, 331, 246, 316]"

This is a Chambers Application wherein the Applicant seeks approval of the Court for a settlement reached on behalf of the infant plaintiff in this matter.
This means the Contingency Fee Agreement is out.
The rules with regard to Contingency Fee Agreements as set out must be adhered to to ensure fairness to all the parties concerned.
I am prepared to receive and review a properly prepared account as provided for in the Rules.
I hasten to point out the Court is not prepared to allow the Taxing Master's account of $50.00 in any event.
It appears the Taxing Master did not check to see if the Contingency Fee Agreement met the requirements of the Civil Procedure Rule governing it.
That was a task that was placed upon the Taxing Master when he was asked to have the account taxed.
As this was not done, the Court is not prepared to allow any fee payable to the Taxing Master.
January 13, 1997","The applicant sought approval of the Court for a settlement reached on behalf of the infant plaintiff, who had been injured in an automobile accident.
Part of the order sought provided for the payment of solicitor fees by way of a contingency fee agreement negotiated with the applicant.

As regards procedural fairness, I agree that the time frames provided by the rules for the average case are inappropriate here.
I have a proposition to propose to Sobeys.
My proposal respecting adjournment would take us, I suspect, a few months away from now giving Sobeys sufficient opportunity to deal with those issues but commensurate with what you would expect with an application.
I would propose to set a timetable for conduct of discoveries, production by the receiver of any documents the receiver may be able to find, etc.
I would propose ordering that the affidavits and exhibits in the Shoppers case should become evidence in this case.
I would, as I say, require the receiver to make productions, and I would allow the receiver also to make discoveries and to produce further evidence if it chose to do so .
Or, I can give my decision on the interpretation of the Sobeys lease and the application for a permanent injunction.
I assure the parties that I have come to no conclusion on either of those at this time.","The defendant had a 25 year lease in a shopping centre which provided that the defendant would only use the premises for the purposes of the business of the retail sale of a complete line of food products, as well as general merchandising, as carried out by the rest of the majority of its stores.
The defendant proposed to open a pharmacy on the premises.
Another tenant in the shopping centre already operated a drug store and their lease provided that no other tenant would operate a drug store in any part of their premises.
The other tenant brought an application for a interim injunction against the defendant.
The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises.
The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial.
Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration.","[0, 169, 1, 168, 166, 2, 4, 3, 167, 6, 165, 163, 5, 161, 159]"

1.          BACKGROUND
J. Colleen Killorn, in her statement of claim, filed September 9, 1993 seeks a declaration of wrongful dismissal and damages including commissions and remuneration in lieu of reasonable notice, mental distress and punitive damages.
Additionally she claims commissions due under her remuneration terms of her employment.
Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the defence specifically state:
""8.                On termination of her employment, the Plaintiff was offered $14,000, less statutory deductions, in lieu of notice.
If the jury determines that the agreement is oral, then it is for them to determine the contents and, after receipt of proper instruction, to determine whether there has been a breach and the quantum of damages.""
and also at p. 280:
“              As noted earlier, merely because it is difficult to explain to the jury the law to be applied to the facts is not grounds for disentitling a party to its substantive right to have a jury, as its trier of facts.
The application is therefore denied.""
       COSTS
The plaintiff shall have her costs of this application taxed in the amount of $500 inclusive of disbursements payable forthwith.","This was an application by the defendant to strike the plaintiffs Notice of Trial With a Jury in a wrongful dismissal action.
The notice had been outstanding for more than 10 months at the time the application was made, and a trial date had been set seven months prior to the application.
Dismissing the application with costs,

Judges:                           Roscoe, Saunders and Oland, JJ.A.
It is not for the motions judge to resolve the issue. [emphasis added]
The order of the chambers judge should be confirmed, although for different reasons.
I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.
[43]         Rule 41A.09(1) provides costs consequences for the failure to accept an offer to settle that is more favourable than that ordered after trial.
The respondents have not pointed to any case determining that Rule 41A.09(1) is applicable to offers to settle appeals.
Assuming without deciding that it is applicable, I would decline to order double party and party costs from the date of the offer in this case.
As noted above, the appellant raised arguable issues and it is apparent that the chambers judge did not apply the test for summary judgment correctly.
Furthermore, the offer to settle, involving waiver of costs of the application and those that might be ordered after appeal, was for an insignificant amount in comparison to the amount of money ultimately at issue here.
I would order that the appellant pay costs to the Larkin respondents in the amount of $1,500 plus disbursements and also to the Huntley respondents in the amount of $1,500 plus disbursements.
Concurred in:","A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway.
An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway.
The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway.
When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed.
Appeal dismissed.
At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit.
It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit.
Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.","[260, 1, 0, 263, 261, 2, 5, 258, 253, 3, 257, 254, 9, 4, 259, 249, 262]"

In my view, no trial judge or jury properly instructed would make a finding of negligence against the defendant driver, having considered the body of evidence that is before me, in this application.
The plaintiff has therefore failed to show that this claim has any real chance of success.
The plaintiff cannot resist this summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff’s credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge.
The plaintiff must demonstrate that if the matter proceeded to trial there would be a remedy available to her.
No evidentiary foundation has been laid to support or underpin the allegations made in the pleadings, apart from the plaintiff’s bare allegation.
The defendant should not be required to bear the expense of a trial where the result is a foregone conclusion that he would not bear liability for this mishap.
The defendant shall have summary judgment and costs for this application.
In the absence of agreement by the parties the court is prepared to address the issue of costs.
Justice M. Heather Robertson","The plaintiff alleged that a small piece of metal seen dangling from beneath the defendant's tractor trailer flew out from under the trailer as it passed the plaintiff's vehicle and hit her engine hood, bounced in the open window and caused her to lose control of her vehicle.
She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control.
The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled.
Application for summary judgment granted;
the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success.

Judge:                           The Honourable Justice Simon J. MacDonald
On the information provided to the Court from both parties it is conceivable with the material before me, the plaintiff’s injuries could be described as minor.
Thus, a Court should be extremely cautious in approaching an award in this particular category in the absence of significant medical evidence which would clearly establish this injury classification could be overcome.
It must be recalled that under the legislation the onus is on the plaintiff to prove any injuries she sustained are not minor in nature.
On a review of the material supplied for this application, I am not satisfied  this is an appropriate case to order an interim payment at this point in time and I decline to do so.
In my opinion, to assess any amount of interim payment on the facts presented would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess.
This is not a basis to fix an interim payment.
However, as I said before, I would order summary judgment be entered against the defendant with damages to be assessed.
Each party having been partially successful, I would order no costs to either side.
Order accordingly.","The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment.
The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered.
The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working.
Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed.
There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle.
However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.","[0, 1, 114, 116, 115, 4, 110, 113, 2, 112, 6, 109, 3, 111, 7, 106]"

II         LEASE TERM
The evidence advanced by Archie Snow in Cross-examination of his affidavit includes the following:
Page 8...
So, are you telling me that that didn’t have to do with that lease?
A.        Mr. MacNeil was never instructed to prepare lease forms.
Credibility relating to how a party conducts itself is relevant to the issue of costs.
I have no doubt that when Warner referred to having sold the inventory for $5,000. that whatever context he put it in, his intent clearly was to mislead the Trustee.
Similarly, his explanation that his employees when they removed part of the inventory in the white van, drove out towards Gabarus, somewhere more than 15 miles from the place on Charlotte Street where they were supposed to be relocating the inventory.
Mr. Warner suggests this was just a lark and that, I simply do not accept, it was clearly part and parcel of his attempt of County Realty Limited to mislead the Trustee and avoid the repossession.","When the trustee attended at the premises of the bankrupt, he found the bankrupt's inventory being loaded into a van by the landlord; after obtaining a consent order which allowed it to take possession of the assets for the purposes of compiling an inventory, the trustee brought an application for summary judgment against the landlord.
Application for summary judgment granted.
The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant.","[0, 87, 89, 90, 190, 188, 92, 1, 187, 43, 93, 189]"

Appeal Heard:      April 11, 2003, in Halifax, Nova Scotia
It is difficult to conceive of what additional information the appellants need at this stage.
The respondent has specified the type of damages that it seeks.
The necessity for particulars must be evaluated taking into account the nature of the action and the timing of the demand in the context of the Civil Procedure Rules as a whole.
There are other Rules (for example Rules 18, 19 and 20) which can be utilized by the appellants to discover the underlying details of the damage claim.
The matter on appeal is an interlocutory, discretionary decision of a Chambers judge.
The standard of review is a simple but stringent one.
This Court will not interfere unless wrong principles of law have been applied or patent injustice would result.
I am not persuaded that either is the case.
It is my view that this interlocutory appeal is unnecessary and completely without merit.
I would dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondent of $1500 inclusive of disbursements.
Concurred in:","The plaintiff company sued the defendants for negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract alleging that the defendants sold it a piece of land smaller than what it was represented to be.
The plaintiff intended to excavate and sell sand from the land and claimed damages including loss of profits due to the smaller amount of sand available.
Before filing a defence the appellants demanded particulars of the alleged lost profits.
The plaintiff refused to provide particulars and the chambers judge dismissed the appellants' application for an order compelling particulars.
,appeal dismissed;
the appellants had not challenged the sufficiency of the pleadings; no case was made out that the appellants required the particulars in order to file a proper defence to the action. 
There were other rules available to the appellants which could be utilized to discover the underlying details of the damage claim.","[0, 54, 53, 1, 52, 2, 50, 3, 51, 5, 49, 4, 48, 47, 6, 7, 46, 8, 45, 9, 44]"
514,"-     the action set out in the statement of claim is sustainable as the appellants acted in breach of their public duty;
-     section 7 of the Public Inquiries Act is ultra vires the Nova Scotia Assembly under the Constitution Act, 1867, because it would have the effect of elevating the members of the Board to the status of s. 96 judges.
Should the ratio in Rivard be construed narrowly?
These comments, in my opinion, are directed to the immunity of provincially constituted inferior tribunals at common law, and are not relevant to the present issue which is concerned with a specific statutory immunity equivalent to that of a judge of a superior court, or as expressed here, a judge ""of the Supreme Court"".
The Issue of the Breach of Public Duty
The cases cited in support of this submission are distinguishable, in my opinion, as they deal with the concept of absolute, or unfettered, discretion or authority, rather than the principle of absolute immunity.
In each of the three cases, relied upon by Future Inns, (McGillivray v. Kimber, 1915 CanLII 608 (SCC), [1915]

I would allow the appeal, strike out the originating notice and statement of claim, except for the allegations against Mr. Darby.
Under the circumstances, I would not award costs to any of the parties.
Concurred in:","The appellants motion to strike the respondent's statement of claim was dismissed on the ground that questions of law are not matters to be brought before the court on an application to strike.
The Chambers judge also accepted the respondent's submission that the extent of the immunity of administrative boards and their members from actions such as this based on their alleged malice and bad faith is, as yet, unclear in Canada.
Allowing the appeal in part,
that the Chambers judge erred when he concluded that all questions of law, including questions where the law is clear, should not be brought before the court in an application to strike, when he concluded that the constitutional question posed by the respondent had not yet been answered by the courts, and when he determined that the extent of the immunity of the appellant Board and its members, except for the Chair, was unclear.
The appeal was allowed with respect to the action against the Board and the individual members, apart from the Chair.","[331, 363, 332, 362, 361, 333, 316, 330, 334, 314, 315]"

This is an appeal from a decision of a judge of the Family Court declining to rescind an order in 1993 for permanent care and custody of the appellant's granddaughter.
The basis on which the application was made to the Family Court was that the appellant consented to or agreed with the 1993 order on the faith of the agency's then plan of care which envisaged that adoption plans would be initiated by the appellant.
Unfortunately, the adoption plans did not materialize because the agency lost confidence in the appellant's parenting skills.

On learning of this resolution, Mr. Oickle made the application that gives rise to this appeal.
The judge described the nature of the proposed derivative action:
With that in mind, I am satisfied that the proposed suit is in the interest of the company.
Terms
The fourth and last ground of appeal is whether the judge erred by imposing the terms he did on the derivative action, specifically the retention by Mr. Oickle of an accountant at the Company’s expense and requiring disclosure to the accountant.
    The judge ordered:
While it would have been preferable for the judge to have raised these specific terms with the parties more clearly to ensure he had their full input, his failure to do more than he did does not amount to reversible error.
Accordingly I would grant leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal and order costs payable by the appellants to the respondents in the amount of $3,000 plus disbursements payable immediately.

The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company.
The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action.
The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites.

there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies.
The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","[0, 23, 430, 429, 22, 402, 403, 1, 428, 404, 399, 74, 222]"

FAIRNESS
Fairness would dictate that such information be disclosed to Lee's opposing parties.
RETAINER
The terms of Mr. Muttart's retainer by Lee are not clear to me.
That was a concern that was in essence none of my business, and whatever business relationship these people wanted to have was entirely up to them and indeed had already been forged.
I was simply questioning to determine whether anybody wanted to revisit it and it was clear that they didn't and so we moved on.
CONCLUSION
On the basis of these various grounds I am prepared to order disclosure.
TERMS OF ORDER
The extent of the production sought in this application is too broad.
[31]         During Mr. Muttart's discovery he referred to two ""events"" when he may have warned or questioned Mr. Lee about the transaction in question and in particular Mr. Lee's business relationship with Mr. Christmas.
I direct that Mr. Muttart shall release any narrative within his accounting records which bear upon the timing or content of that advice, but not including any of the financial details of Mr. Muttart's professional services rendered to Lee.","The borrower in a mortgage foreclosure action counterclaimed against the lender and joined the insurer of the mortgage and experts he had retained for advice in the development on the basis of negligent misrepresentation.
During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate.
No privilege was claimed during the discovery process.
The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs.
Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced.
The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant.
The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver.
There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.","[0, 4, 223, 5, 232, 8, 221, 220, 197, 222, 9, 196, 13, 224, 198, 176, 219, 231]"

Citation: Wickwire Holm v. Stephen, 2008 NSSM 39
Melanie Stephen, Self‑represented
By the Court:
INTRODUCTION: The Applicant, Wickwire Holm, has requested a taxation of the accounts that it issued to the Respondent, Melanie Stephen.
Otherwise, this was a fairly straightforward and uncomplicated taxation.
ANALYSIS OF THE LEGAL ACCOUNTS: I intend to consider Ms. Stephen's specific complaints regarding the legal accounts.
I will also consider the reasonableness of the accounts.
There can be no dispute that the accounts are lawful.
Ms. Stephen's first complaint is that she was ""overbilled.""
This fact is not easily explained but it was clear from the evidence that Ms. Stephen had actually wanted to stay in the matrimonial home indefinitely.
There was one final argument raised by Ms. Stephen that I will address.
Ms. Stephen argued that because she had been making payments on the accounts, the Applicant was therefore not permitted to seek to have its accounts taxed.
There is no authority of which I am aware that supports this argument nor is there any principled reason that I can think of to explain why such an argument should be sustained.
In the result, I am prepared to certify the accounts presented by the Applicant as filed and I will prepare a Certificate of Taxation to that effect.
Small Claims Court Adjudicator","The applicant law firm applied for a taxation of accounts in a complicated family law matter.
The client contended that there was obvious overbilling and that the solicitor was negligent in failing to specify in an interim Order the actual time at which she had to leave the matrimonial home.
Accounts as presented are certified;
there was no indication whatsoever of overbilling, whether with respect to legal fees or disbursements, and there was no negligence on the part of the solicitor as she had acted reasonably in relying on the representations of the husband's lawyer as to when the Order would be enforced.
It is not always necessary to examine every single entry in detail on a line-by-line basis; an overall view of the entries contained in an account can be taken when assessing reasonableness.
The temporal limitation of cross-examination is within the Small Claims Court's scope of discretion in special circumstances.","[13, 0, 210, 207, 148, 25, 206, 14, 149, 204, 205, 1, 150, 12, 151, 203]"
520,"IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA
Defendants
This is a clear direction that in determining the amount of the interim payment, a limitation exists on such amount as the court thinks just.
“A reasonable proportion of the damages which in the opinion of the court are likely to be recovered by the plaintiff.”
Once the court has established an opinion as to what is likely to be recovered, it is mandated to take into account any relevant contributory negligence set-off, cross-claim or counter-claim for which the defendant may have an entitlement.
However, I urge the Board, in asserting its claim, to accommodate this application by acquiescing in a substantial amount of this interim payment being paid directly to Mr. Fowler.
Part of the rationale for the interim payment rule is to alleviate hardship of individual plaintiffs and it was designed to benefit plaintiffs personally in deserving cases.
I also observe that the Workers’ Compensation Board claim includes a 10% administration fee and a sizable amount for legal fees and disbursements which bear no connection whatsoever with the nature of the interim payment that I have ordered.
I encourage the Board to take these considerations into account in relaxing the immediate enforcement of its claim.","In a trial of liability only, jury found defendants to be entirely responsible for causing motor vehicle accident.
Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff.
Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages.
Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied.
Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount.
The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced.
There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment.
Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition.
In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered.
Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application.
The evidence in support of the spouse's application was far too incomplete and had yet to be tested by defendants in discovery.
Court could not form opinion on what damages spouse was likely to recover.","[6, 33, 34, 0, 112, 110, 111, 36, 109]"

v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), 2008 NSSC 18
It seems evident that The Turkey Board having refused to appear at the hearing because their request for adjournment had been denied, left council with no decision to make.
The merits of the case and the reasons for holding the “show cause” were  apparently never before the Council.
The Law:
The Applicant  proposes a highly restrictive view of what the Court may take into consideration on the two applications brought by the Board.
It is argued that affidavit evidence is only admissible if the record does not provide enough information regarding the issues in dispute.
All the relevant materials with respect to the statute and regulations, the practices of the Council and the Board, will assist in determining the jurisdictional questions, likewise the circumstances relating to procedural fairness demand adjudication.
It is to be hoped that the decision of this Court, when made will assist these two bodies in understanding their respective roles, their respective authority and assuring the rules of natural justice, with respect to adjournments or otherwise, are honoured.
The application to strike the two affidavits is denied for all the above reasons.","The defendant council, charged with the general oversight and administration of matters under the Natural Products Marketing Act, delegated certain authority to commodity boards such as the plaintiff.
The plaintiff requested that the defendant hold a show cause hearing to determine whether certain producers had contravened their licence but when a procedural breakdown occurred as to how that hearing would be conducted, with the plaintiff seeking and being denied an adjournment, the hearing was held without the plaintiff's participation.
The plaintiff brought an application for mandamus to compel the defendant to hold a new hearing and filed two affidavits providing some detail and background information as to its reasoning for its failure to attend the hearing and the parties' differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan.
The defendant brought an application to strike certain of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff on the basis that they were an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not forming part of the record.
Application to strike affidavits dismissed;
the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible.
There was no authority for denying the parties the use of affidavits should this application proceed as a jurisdictional dispute and, should it proceed by way of an error of law on the face of the record, the affidavits were also admissible to complete the record.","[134, 82, 83, 0, 84, 133, 85, 2, 81, 132]"

[22]            In summary, having excluded the main affidavit, there was, in my opinion, no admissible evidence before the judge to found the appellant’s position.
The remaining evidence neither supported Mr. MacArthur’s application for a recovery order pursuant to Rule 48.06(1)(a) nor was it adequate to justify the setting aside or modification of the original recovery order pursuant to Rule 48.08(b)(ii).
Justice Davison did not err in dismissing the applications.

By the Court:
Fourthly, the court must discourage unnecessary steps in the litigation.
The view has been expressed that costs should not be imposed as a matter of arbitrary or capricious practice by courts, but there should be a consistency of pattern.
The author goes on to state that “a party’s conduct both before and during the litigation process as well as the degrees of success achieved are relevant to the exercise of the courts discretion as to costs”.
I have concluded that both parties conduct led to the need for this trial.
I have also found that success was mixed and it would be impossible to conclude that one was more successful that the other.
I exercise my discretion not to award costs and the parties will bear their own costs.
This includes disbursements and pre judgment interest, something both parties had to endure.
This was a case with high settlement prospects but the parties were not really open to this kind of resolution.","Despite the court's finding of no clear winner and that both parties had contributed to the circumstances that led to the trial, the plaintiff sought costs on the basis that the defendant had refused its offer to settle.

Judge:                           The Honourable Justice Arthur J. LeBlanc.
Allen Fownes, for the Respondent/Plaintiff
An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy, and I am satisfied that its existence will hinder any attempt by Sterling Farm to resume or expand its operations.
The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is not sufficient reason to dispose of the corporate veil.
[30]         Ultimately, I do not believe that the plaintiff has established any of the grounds available under the rules governing attachment orders.
An attachment order should not be maintained on the basis of suspicion and supposition, which is the essence of the plaintiff’s position in support (for instance, the supposition relating to the significance of the property online entry).
Both the former Rule 49.01 and the current Rule 44.02 are clear in requiring the applicant to establish facts, not allegations or suspicions.
On that basis, I am satisfied the attachment order must be terminated.
I award costs to the applicant of $1,000 payable in any event in the cause.                                                        ","The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor.
The latter was not opposed.
There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence.
The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court.
Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested.
Neither party has a connection to Halifax.
The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County.
The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant.
An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations.
Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order.
The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil.
The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders.
The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions.
The affidavit in question was flawed.
It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","[186, 0, 187, 183, 185, 1, 184, 2, 182, 180, 3, 5, 4, 8]"

I would dismiss the application of the Union to be joined as an intervener pursuant to Rule 62.35.
The alternative application that the Union be joined as an amicus curiae, or an interested person, pursuant to Rule 8, should be dismissed as well, for the reasons set forth by Justice Hallett in Adams.
The Union also relies upon Rule 5.04(2).
Rule 5.04 under the heading “Misjoinder and Nonjoinder of Parties”, provides:
At any stage of a proceeding the court may, on such terms as it thinks just and either of its own motion or on application, 
I do not accept the Union’s submission that it applied to Justice Tidman to be joined as an intervener, or as a party, pursuant to Rule 5.04 or Rule 8.
I would further decline to exercise my discretion to refer this matter to a panel of the Court in view of the remedies available to the Union at the Supreme Court level.
Accordingly, I reject the applications for leave to obtain intervener status as a party, or as amicus curiae, or alternatively as an intervener, and I further reject the application to set down this matter for hearing before a panel of this Court.
In the circumstances, I decline to award costs.","The respondent filed an interlocutory notice, ex parte application, against the intended defendants, seeking an interim injunction.

Rejecting the applications,
that a Court of Appeal judge sitting in chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status or to join a person as a party to a proceeding.
Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal.","[125, 200, 198, 199, 126, 0, 2, 127, 128, 129, 196]"

He dismissed the application to amend.
The second problem – that no notice had been given to the proposed new party – was not addressed by the parties or the judge.
I will return to it later in my reasons.
As noted earlier, there are two issues: first, did the judge err in finding that he had no discretion to grant the amendment; and, second, if so, what order ought we to make on appeal.
I will address each in turn after saying a word about the standard of appellate review.
C.     What Order Should Be Made on Appeal? 
Normally in a case like this one, it would be appropriate for this Court to make whatever order we think the judge ought to have made.
However, I do not think we should do so in this case.
    A critical question in relation to any amendment is whether it will occasion any prejudice which cannot be compensated in costs.
An amendment to alter the capacity in which a party sues (whether as plaintiff or as defendant by counterclaim) may be allowed under paragraph (2) if the capacity in which, if the amendment is made, the party will sue is one in which at the date of issue of the write or the making of the counterclaim, as the case may be, he might have sued.","Six years after the action was commenced, the plaintiff applied to add the defendant's Section D insurer in order to add a cause of action against an unidentified driver.
The limitation period for suing under Section D had expired and no notice of the application had been given to the insurer.
The chambers judge held that he had no discretion to grant the amendment and dismissed the application.
The plaintiff appealed.
Appeal allowed; the plaintiff is entitled to renew the application for the amendment in Supreme Court chambers on notice to the proposed, as well as the existing, defendant within sixty days of today's date; if not filed within that time, the application to add the insurer will be deemed to have been abandoned.
The court had a discretion to grant the amendment even though the case did not fall within any of the specific situations set out in Rule 15.02 as the broad power to amend conferred by Rule 15 is not limited to the specific instances set out the Rule.
Although there was no firm rule that notice to a proposed defendant was necessary in all such applications, generally the applicant should give notice to the proposed defendant (as well as the existing parties) where it is apparent from the circumstances that the proposed defendant likely has a reasonable basis to oppose being joined, such as being prejudiced in its defence by the plaintiff's long delay in asserting his claim.","[0, 168, 169, 55, 1, 54, 2, 53, 170, 171, 52, 3, 51, 211]"

COSTS

The Board, at this meeting, provided a “short list” of schools more directly affected by the decisions of school closure, and persons associated with these schools were given additional opportunities to provide input to the Board with respect to closure.
A public meeting was held at Notting Park on March 27, 2001 and at Northbrook on March 29, 2001.
The Board held a special meeting on April 17, 2001 to consider closure.
Monday, April 16, 2001 was Easter Monday.
At that meeting the Board voted in a 9 to 4 ratio to close Notting Park and in a 7 to 6 ratio to close Northbrook.

[7]              Although many issues are raised on appeal, it is only necessary, in my view, to deal with two of them:
Should we consider the appropriateness of the underlying judicial review application on this interlocutory appeal?
If so, should the underlying judicial review application be stayed or dismissed with the result that it is not necessary to address the other issues raised?
The question of whether the court may order production is one of statutory interpretation.

In short, while I prefer to extend considerable judicial deference to the Commission in the discharge of its regulatory responsibilities in the public interest, that deference is neither absolute nor open-ended.
It is, in my view, essential that the Commission take serious and immediate steps to come to grips with the obvious issues which have arisen in the course of the investigation which it has ordered.

He alleged that the investigators had improperly obtained and used the contents of his email, some of which were subject to solicitor and client privilege.
In the context of the certiorari application, the company president successfully argued that the Commission's return should contain the fruits of the investigation so far and that he should be entitled to examine one of the investigators for discovery.
The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made.
Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside.
The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints.
The decision as to whether or not to release the information sought required the balancing of competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case; the Commission was in the best position to conduct such an exercise.","[0, 174, 35, 34, 220, 218, 1, 219, 33, 176, 217, 2, 177]"

[5]              The hearing in this matter was less than two hours in duration, however, there were a number of steps taken prior to the application including filing a list of documents, exchange of documents and apparently two days of discovery.
The defendant made an offer of settlement in the amount of $5,000, inclusive of costs, which I take to be an attempt to have the action simply go away due to the heavy costs of litigation.
As I indicated, the sale price of the property which was approximately $2,000,000 was not, in my view, the appropriate “amount involved”, and it was very difficult and, in fact, impossible for me to really get a handle on what amount of loss of profits was being pursued or to what extent the defendants were monetarily at risk.
I am left therefore with a judgment call as to what is a reasonable level of indemnity to the defendants who have been successful on an application which does dispose of the matter before the court.
[6]              In the circumstances, I think a reasonable and fit party and party level of costs is $5,000 plus disbursements of $510.97 and the defendant is entitled to judgment for costs and disbursements herein taxed and allowed in the amount of $5,510.97.","The court granted the defendant's application for summary judgment of claim.

[8]               Under paragraph (j), however, the court may consider any other matter relevant to the question of costs.
In my opinion, the reasonable cost to a successful party to obtain recovery of a just claim is a relevant matter.
Here it appears that it will cost the plaintiffs $21,663.48 in legal fees to recover $29,150.00.
This may appear to be a disproportionate amount of costs in view of the relatively moderate recovery.
However, it was necessary for the plaintiffs to expend this amount in order for them to recover the money they had lost through no fault of their own, which in their circumstances was not an insignificant amount.
[9]               I have concluded, therefore, that it is appropriate to go outside the tariffs in determining what is a reasonable amount for the defendant to contribute to the plaintiffs' costs.
In my view the plaintiff should contribute $10,000.00 toward the plaintiffs' costs plus disbursements.
Counsel have agreed on disbursements of $1,213.16.
[10]           Accordingly, I fix the plaintiffs costs at $11,213.16, including disbursements.","Following a four day trial, the plaintiffs were successful in the recovery of the sum of $29,150 against the defendant.
Under the usual tariff, costs would be fixed at $4,725.
The plaintiffs sought substantially increased costs on the basis that the defendant should have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial.
Solicitor and client fees totaled over $21,000.
Costs fixed at $10,000 plus disbursements;
there was no obligation on the defendant to admit liability but considering the amount of legal fees incurred in relation to the amount recovered, it was appropriate to go outside the tariffs.","[44, 0, 1, 43, 42, 2, 41, 3, 4, 40, 39, 6, 5, 38, 37, 7, 36]"

Paragraph 10(a) of the corollary relief judgment states:

Likewise, the Mother shall contribute financially or otherwise as she can, to assist each Child’s post secondary education.
This clause satisfies me that the parties left open the subject of funding post secondary education for all of their children.

The plaintiffs now claim damages for the injuries they sustained as a result of the accident which they allege was caused by the careless and negligent actions of GMCL in the design and manufacture of the vehicle involved.
[6]              GMCL’s motion for summary judgment is against Steven and Jody Johansson only.
It does not involve the other plaintiff, Maria Johansson.
[8]              Civil Procedure Rule 13.01(1) allows for summary judgment either on pleadings that are clearly unsustainable or on evidence establishing that there is no genuine issue for trial.
(6)        The motion may be made after pleadings close.
Application of the Law to the Facts:
GMCL places the blame solely on the driver and plans to seek contribution from her and her insurer should Steven and Jody Johansson be allowed to proceed with their claims.
In the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Fraser River Pile & Dredge Ltd. v. Can-Dive Services Ltd., 1999 CanLII 654 (SCC), [1999]
To allow their action to proceed would be an abuse of this Court’s process.
Conclusion
The parties are encouraged to try to reach agreement on costs failing which they are invited to file written submissions within 30 calendar days of the date of release of this decision.","The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson.
They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel').
More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages.
GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases.
They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party.
Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed.
There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson.
The releases were clear and unambiguous.
Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident.
They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel.
While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'.
Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general.
GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs.
To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","[26, 0, 88, 83, 25, 1, 82, 28, 77, 36, 2, 62, 24, 3, 76]"

The statement of claim otherwise makes a claim that is clearly unsustainable when the pleading is read on its own.
PARTICULARS OF DAMAGES:
The AGC argues that notwithstanding finding a cause of action, the plaintiff’s amended statement of claim does not plead sufficient material facts to comply with the rules.
The following rules address the sufficiency of a claim:
The statement of claim must notify the defendant of all the claims to be raised by the plaintiff at trial, conform with Rule 38 - Pleading, and include each of the following:
(b) a concise statement of the material facts relied on by the plaintiff, but not argument or the evidence by which the material facts are to be proved;
[30]         Civil Procedure Rule 13:03(1) states that a statement of claim must be set aside for “any” of the three enumerated grounds.
I rely on the third ground to conclude that this action must be set aside because it is “clearly unsustainable when the pleading is read on its own.”
I find that Mr. Innocente’s claim is clearly unsustainable.
Accordingly his amended statement of claim is dismissed with costs to the AGC in the amount of $500.00.","Rule 13.03 – Summary judgment on pleadings, motion granted on the basis of Rule 13.03(1)(c)).
While the claim discloses a possible cause of action based on the Attorney General's statutory undertakings, this alone doesn't decide the matter.

Analysis
[5]              Ms. Saturley’s comments are well taken.
I do have some concerns about the 5 year duration of the non-compete clause and with the chances of the Plaintiff ultimately succeeding.
When I look at s. 41.04 and the implications of granting an Interim Injunction at this time, however,  I have decided that it is the appropriate and just thing to do in the circumstances.
Section 41.04 states a party who files an undertaking as required by Rule 41.06 (and that has been done) may make a motion for an Interim Injunction to a Judge who, being satisfied with all of the following, may grant the motion:
Despite the able submission by Ms. Saturley about the consequences of losing time for a small business in Nova Scotia, the bottom line is that the Defendant is facing only the postponement of the opening for a few weeks.
The stakes are much higher for the Plaintiff’s existing business.
The balance of convenience, obviously favours the status quo.
The Interim Injunction will issue.
The Interlocutory Injunction motion will be heard in Halifax before Justice LeBlanc on April 24, 2012.  ","The applicant is the only drug store in a rural community.
The respondent worked there for 30 years, in various positions.
He signed a 5-year, 10 mile non-competition clause in 1995.
He quit in early March with the intention of opening a new drug store down the street in early April.
Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store.
The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction.
Interim injunction granted.
The new Civil Procedure Rules (2008) distinguish between interim and interlocutory injunctions.
This is one of the circumstances which was contemplated when the new Rule 41.04 was enacted.
Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait.
While the non-competition clause may well not survive a challenge at the full hearing of the interlocutory injunction motion, all the applicant needs to show is that there is a serious issue to be tried.
There is.
This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application.
There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community.
An interim injunction will only result in a delay of a few weeks.
The interlocutory injunction is set to heard at the end of April.
The stakes are higher for the applicant than they are for the respondent.","[6, 0, 98, 49, 97, 50, 51, 95, 96, 52, 41, 53, 94]"

By the Court:
Introduction
[1]              The Bowsers were successful as Respondents in a Chambers application which was heard for a full day on October 18, and a half day on October 20, 2011 - see 2011 NSSC 450 (CanLII).
[2]              On May 12, 2011, the Sheas filed a Notice of Application in Chambers.
I conclude that the matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required a significant amount of effort to prepare for, conduct the hearing and to review the evidence to be able to provide briefs to the court post hearing.
Without attaching undue weight to the statement of account dated December 7, 2011 of Ms. Jerome, it does seem to be a reasonable reflection of the effort involved.
In my view, as appropriate partial compensation toward the Bowsers’ expenses of litigation, and to do justice between the parties here, I should apply a multiplier of two for a total of $6000 in costs.
Rule 77.10 allows me to include “necessary and reasonable disbursements”, and there having been no apparent dispute about those, I will allow the claimed amount $302.75 plus HST as the disbursements amount.
I would request that the Bowsers prepare a draft order for my signature.","Rule 77.03 – Liability for costsThe court found in favor of the respondents after a half-day chambers hearing.
They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim.
Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two.
This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing.
While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs.
The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner.","[11, 0, 13, 83, 12, 81, 80, 82, 79, 17]"
538,"SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA
Defendant
DECISION
It is my determination that the Tariff C costs should be increased.
In awarding increased costs to the Defendant, there are several reasons for doing so.
While falling short in my decision of finding that the issuing of the discovery subpoenas was an abuse of process, I did find that their issuance was an improper step in these circumstances.
Further the Plaintiff was given the opportunity, as suggested by the Defendant to withdraw the subpoenas.
Also, in Gouin the Court considered relevant, the practice in its jurisdiction, which may or may not vary from other jurisdictions.
Lastly the Court in Gouin appeared ready to deviate from the “usual order”, but concluded that no good reason was shown to do so.
In the present case, the Court considered counsels’ positions offered on the practice in Nova Scotia (including under the 1972 Rules) and exercised its discretion, in rendering its decision on the motion.
The Defendant first knowing the case it has to meet formed the basis of that decision.
In conclusion the total costs payable by the Plaintiff to the Defendant on the motion shall be $2,550 plus disbursements of $332.21, for a total of $2,882.21 payable within 20 days.","The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered.
As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates.
The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays.
While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot.
The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion.
The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief.
The motion was heard over approximately one-half day.
Motion granted.
The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs.
The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process.
It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike.
The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to.
Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong.
His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response.
Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism.","[10, 0, 266, 209, 210, 211, 267, 212, 264, 265, 263, 214]"

Docket:  Probate No. 56949 
Hfx No. 325163
Registry: Halifax
The Estate of Pauline Hand
DECISION on COSTS
The application was not ""estate litigation"".
It was litigation between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.
I have therefore determined not to award costs against the estate in favour of Richard Hand.
The purpose of an award of costs is to provide the successful party with a partial but substantial indemnity against legal fees measured by what would ordinarily be charged to a client for the kind of work undertaken on behalf of the successful party in the actual case.
In light of the present position of Dr. Hand and his daughter, and my determination not to order costs in favour of Mr. Hand, those three parties will bear their own costs.
It was necessary for the estate to participate in the application because it originally involved questions about Mrs. Hand's property, it involved a demand for accounting, and the late Mr. Thomas Burchell, Q.C., was subpoenaed to give evidence about both the administration of the estate and the wills he drafted.
Considering all of the circumstances, the representatives of the estate should be entitled to recover their solicitor and client costs from the estate.","A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death.
His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death.
Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate.
In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister.
The parties will bear their own costs.
There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs.
Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded.
As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here.
The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid.
The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation?
In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","[68, 0, 1, 2, 3, 66, 64, 67, 4, 63, 62, 5, 6, 65]"

I am therefore prepared to accept that the second condition has been met.
However, given the circumstances of the aggravated assault offence, his record of violent offences, and the numerous breaches of court orders, I am not persuaded that his release would be in the public interest.
The appellant’s release so soon after being sentenced, in order for him to attend school in the community, would tend to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.
The application for release pending appeal is therefore dismissed.","The young person appealed his sentence on an aggravated assault conviction following a drive-by shooting and applied for release pending appeal.
Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school.
Application for release pending appeal dismissed.
The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard.
Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","[0, 117, 14, 116, 13, 15, 115, 17, 114, 20]"

While the above cases were decided under a different statutory scheme, these cases provide a strong basis upon which to conclude that mandamus is available in circumstances similar to that present in this application.
I reject the Respondent’s submission that the appropriate remedy for the Applicant is to appeal the Department’s most recent decision on eligibility.
In fact the Respondent refused to comply with the decision of the Appeal Board and the Applicant should not be required to appeal the Respondent’s refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision.
As to timing, the Act was required to be done when the Appeal Board released its decision, retroactive to June 2007. 
As to the requirement that a request be made, although the Applicant provided further information to the Respondent, he was consistent in his demand that the Respondent comply with the Order of the Appeal Board with respect to assistance effective June 2007.
Accordingly, the Court will grant the application for an Order in the nature of Mandamus compelling the Respondent to implement the Appeal Board’s decision of September 2007.
The Applicant shall have costs in the amount of $750.00 exclusive of disbursements.                             ","The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board.
The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information.
He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated.
The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information.
Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated.
He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement.
Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board.
The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected.
It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision.
To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless.
As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","[86, 87, 0, 1, 85, 84, 2, 82, 3, 81, 80]"

WRITTEN RELEASE
OF DECISION:                     November 2, 1999
COUNSEL:                           Gerald MacDonald, Counsel for the Plaintiffs
Paul McLean, Counsel for the Defendant
This is an application on behalf of the plaintiffs, Flora Burt and her daughter Shelly Dawn Seward, now residents of Jasper, Alberta, essentially for an Order disallowing the limitation defence raised by Judgment Recovery on behalf of the defendant, Howard LeLacheur, pursuant to Section 10 of the Fatal Injuries Act.
The action arises out of a single car accident in which the defendant’s uncle, Vincent LeLacheur, was killed leaving him surviving his wife, the plaintiff Flora Burt, who was then pregnant with the second plaintiff, Shelly Dawn Seward.
In the result, 25 years went by without anything being said by the parties to one another about the tragedy that had taken place.
To compound the difficulty surrounding this application, it is to be noted that the revelation even as made is based on double hearsay, i.e. from Howard LeLacheur allegedly to, I believe, his brother, then on to a daughter and then on to Flora Burt.
All things considered, there has not been established a sufficient evidentiary basis upon which this Court can make a finding of fraudulent concealment on the part of the defendant.
In the result, the plaintiffs’ application to disallow the defence of limitation is dismissed.
In the peculiar circumstances of this case, I decline to award costs to Judgment Recovery.","The deceased was killed in a single car accident in 1972, leaving his wife, the plaintiff, who was pregnant with the second plaintiff, his daughter, as his survivors.
In 1997, the plaintiffs first learned through other family members that the defendant, a nephew of the deceased, had revealed to them that it was actually he who was the driver of the car at the time of the accident.
They brought an action under the provisions of the Fatal Injuries Act.
This was an application to disallow the limitation defence raised by Judgment Recovery on behalf of the defendant.
Dismissing the application without costs,
that the limitation as prescribed by the Act is twelve months, which the plaintiffs had clearly exceeded.
This time period is without regard to the injured party's knowledge of whether or not a claim exists.","[74, 4, 73, 0, 9, 72, 10, 8, 11, 71, 70, 13, 12]"

However, they concluded that the loss was in fact a loss to the deceased, not to the estate.
This approach commended itself to a majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal in James v. Rentz (1986), 1986 ABCA 95 (CanLII), 27 D.L.R. (4th) 724.
The term “actual” serve[d] to exclude possible or contingent claims.” (at p. 726) (emphasis added)
However, a fatal injury award represents the loss of a stream of income to the dependant that could only be paid out of the deceased’s after tax income.
Dickson, J. explained this distinction in Andrews v. Grand & Toy, 1978 CanLII 1 (SCC), [1978]
2 S.C.R. 229 at 259:
(ii)  Allowance for tax:  In The Queen v. Jennings, supra, this Court held that an award for prospective income should be calculated with no deduction for tax which might have been attracted had it been earned over the working life of the plaintiff.
This results from the fact that it is earning capacity and not lost earnings which is the subject of compensation.
At the hearing, the parties indicated that they had agreed on costs and that we need make no order in that regard.
Concurred in:","A fifteen year old died in a motor vehicle accident.
The estate brought a claim for loss of future income and lost earning capacity.
The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.","[570, 594, 1, 2, 569, 568, 571, 593, 512, 567, 510, 514]"

The information sought herein is not part of a law enforcement record and, as I have said, I do not understand how the information might expose any author to civil liability.
BURDEN OF PROOF
(3)     I am satisfied that the third parties have failed to prove that Keating has no right of access to certain of the records or parts of the records as I will identify below.
CONCLUSIONS
I refer again to Keating's request for information, as amended by his counsel.
That is, he has requested ""information pertaining to me in the N.S. Government's program of 'Compensation to Victims of Institutional Abuse'"".
I emphasize that he has not requested specific documents, but rather, information; that request was for the following enumerated items:
In complying with this decision the Department of Justice is to take care not to identify by name any other alleged perpetrators of abuse.
Finally, this is an application for information and not for specific documents.
If the parties encounter unforeseen difficulties in coming to a form or order,  I will be prepared to hear them.
    I am prepared to receive written submissions from the parties with respect to the costs of this application as to entitlement and quantum.","The applicant was aware that allegations of abuse had been made against him in an alternative dispute resolution process undertaken by the Province with respect to his former employment.
He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations.
The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed.
Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven.
The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo.
The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes.
The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant.
Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province.
There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy.
The applicant was entitled to know what he had been accused of and should have the right to correct the record.","[3, 637, 596, 597, 636, 0, 635, 595, 582, 634, 598, 599, 580]"

Counsel:                  Barry Mien for the Appellant 
Wayne Harvey for Respondent
The respondent owns several buildings on Robie Street in the City of Halifax.
The references to unsightly in that subsection cannot be considered in isolation.
When one considers the references to unsightly in the context of the entire section one must conclude that unsightly refers to the types of things mentioned in subsection 3 including the accumulation of ashes, junk, rubbish et cetera.
Unsightly in that subsection cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings because this category is already dealt with in subsection 6.
If the legislators wish to have the actions of the respondent considered an offence an appropriate amendment to subsection 6 would be necessary.
I therefore find that the learned trial judge, when interpreting s. 363(3) made no error in law.
In light of my finding on this first issue it is unnecessary for me to consider the constitutional issue raised by the respondent.
It is suffice to say that any proposed amendment must be drafted in a way that does not invoke Section 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The Crown's appeal is dismissed.
I invite, within two weeks, written submissions on costs.","The respondent landowner haphazardly painted his buildings in order to protest a decision of Halifax city council.

The city appealed.
Dismissing the appeal,
that the trial judge did not commit an error in law.
S.363(3) of the Halifax City Charter, under which the respondent was charged, refers to land as opposed to buildings, and cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings, a category already dealt with in s.363(6), which covers the unsightliness of buildings caused by neglect, not overt actions.","[7, 6, 102, 9, 8, 103, 100, 0, 101, 11, 99, 10, 98, 12, 97, 13, 14, 95, 96]"

It says “Alicia recounts that she saw Jonathan’s bike flying past her and that she stopped and “looked everywhere for Jonathan but could not find him”.
In a panic, she rode down to her house to find her father . . . and then they both returned to the accident site to look for Jonathan.
Jonathan was found about 100 feet away from where he was hit.
It was subsequently determined he was dead.”
Upon consideration I conclude that such is not the result.
I do so because the emotional harm suffered by Alicia Hartling is simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.
It was not contemplated by the contracting parties to the insurance policy.
It was not contemplated by the legislature when they passed the legislation.

INTRODUCTION
What remains for the court to decide in this unusual fact situation is whether that sum is to be paid by Allstate or by ING.
RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS AND LEGAL PRINCIPLES
There are two legislative provisions which must now be applied in deciding the ultimate question of whether the plaintiff’s damages claim must be paid by Allstate or by ING.
Counsel for Mr. Thomas and Allstate invited the court to draw an inference of non-consent from the evidence in its totality.
There are no proven facts from which such an inference can be properly drawn, given the unreliability of Mr. Thomas’ evidence as a whole.
CONCLUSION
This defence was not argued at trial, however, presumably because there was no evidence before the court whatsoever that would sustain such a finding.
Lastly, I will leave it to the parties to try to reach an agreement on costs, failing which I would ask that written submissions be filed by counsel within 30 days.","The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter.
The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle.
The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer.
As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages.
The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed.
The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle.","[0, 18, 254, 248, 1, 16, 17, 220, 247, 29, 2, 19, 221, 3, 246, 15, 253]"

FRAUD OR MISREPRESENTATION ON THE FILING OF THE PROOF OF LOSS
In any event, I would have concluded that the rights of the respective parties were frozen in time by the commencement of the action by Canada Trustco.
This action was commenced before they had received any indemnification from the subscription insurers.
RATEABLE PROPORTION
Section 169 of the Insurance Act provides:
The Home-Guard policy issued by the Defendant, Co-operators, provides:
INSURANCE UNDER MORE THAN ONE POLICY
If you have other insurance which applies to a loss or claim or would have applied if this policy did not exist, we will not pay any loss or claim until the amount of such other insurance is used up.
In all other cases, our policy will pay its rateable proportion of the loss or claim.

The fire occurred less than a day before the first policy was to be cancelled.
The defendant refused to honour the policy.
It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy.

Docket: SH 279588(A)

The matter proceeded by way of argument.
[8]              The Adjudicator found that Section 9 of the Act did not provide the Court with authority to enforce an Order arising from foreign jurisdiction.
The Adjudicator further decided that, although the Court had jurisdiction to proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under contract, it was prohibited as there was no evidence “that the Alberta action was withdrawn, abandoned, struck  out or transferred” pursuant to Section 15 of the Act.
[9]              The Adjudicator also made a finding that the Defendant did not attorn to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Court.
The Appellant appeals the findings of the Adjudicator on the grounds that he committed errors in law in interpreting the relevant sections of the Small Claims Court Act and in his finding that Eastside did not attorn to the Alberta jurisdiction.
Statutory authority for the recognition of judgments in foreign jurisdictions is found in the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act, R.S.N.S. 1989 c. 388.
CONCLUSION
There will be no Order for costs under the circumstances.","The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract.
The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract.
The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out.
The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court.
The claimant appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","[0, 32, 31, 105, 1, 107, 2, 3, 29, 30, 28, 41]"

(iii) Amendment of the Will
I therefore find that s. 8A could not operate to revoke Mr. Hayward’s Will.

In the result, the application to revoke the grant of administration issued to Michael Hayward is granted and the Will of George Hayward is declared to be in full force and effect.
Costs
Each party shall have their costs, on a solicitor/client basis, paid out of the Estate of the Late George Hayward.
Order
I will grant an order accordingly, prepared by counsel for Nancy Hayward, and consented as to form by counsel for both parties.","The testator failed to change his will (which appointed his ex-wife as the sole executrix and beneficiary of his estate) following his divorce.

Application granted;
although the parties' separation agreement included a waiver of any right to share in or administer the other's estate, it did not serve to revoke the will; nor did equitable estoppel apply in the circumstances.

According to the divorce petition the parties separated on August 21, 1996.
The divorce and corollary relief judgments were granted on February 11, 1997.
The appellant asks this Court to set aside the judgments on the basis that the underlying separation agreement is ""unconscionable and unduly harsh.""
In this regard she has applied to the court to admit fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce.

CONSIDERATION
Counsel for the applicant submits that the action will involve complex medical questions and notes that the medical charts exceed 1,500 pages, but it appears that the more relevant hospital records are less than 100 pages.
After considering the issues involved in this case and the nature of the medical and actuarial evidence that will likely be adduced, I am satisfied that a jury would be capable of understanding the issues.
I conclude that the evidence will not be so complex and scientific that the applicant’s substantive right to a trial by jury should be denied.
To do justice to all of the parties, including those other than Mr. McLellan and Dr. Malik, I find that there are not sufficiently cogent reasons to set aside the jury in this case.
Consequently, the application of the defendant, Dr. Malik, to set aside the jury notice is dismissed with costs of $2,500 and disbursements relating directly to the application.","The defendant doctor in a personal injury case applied to set aside the Jury Notice filed by the plaintiff.

ANALYSIS
The Requests to Introduce Fresh Evidence
The Test
[14]         Hamilton, J.A. of this court recently addressed the four part test for admitting fresh evidence on appeal.
In Harris v. Nova Scotia Barristers' Society 2004 NSCA 143 (CanLII), [2004]
N.S.J. No. 463, she noted:
1 S.C.R. 759 at page 775:
[39]         Except for Ms. Murphy’s claim to access her personal belongings, I would dismiss her appeal.
The Respondent’s Grounds of Appeal 
As I earlier noted, Mr. Wulkowicz points to no error on the part of the trial judge.
There is no merit to any of this.
His claim for health care would fall under spousal support and that was never pleaded or appealed.
His claim to the “acreage property” has no merit.
For reasons already provided, the judge committed no reversible error in distributing the Nova Scotia land as he did.
Finally his claim for an easement over Ms. Murphy’s “home property” was never before the trial judge for consideration.
It is not properly before us.
I would dismiss his appeal.
DISPOSITION
Concurred in:","The parties separated shortly after relocating from the United States to Nova Scotia.
As part of the divorce, the Supreme Court ordered a division of assets.
Both parties appealed the asset division; in the process, both parties sought to introduce fresh evidence.
The wife also questioned the level of assistance offered by the trial judge to the husband who was self-represented at trial.

DECISION:                July 9, 1998
COUNSEL:               Joel Fichaud, Q.C., for the plaintiff 
The date when it could be said to be an overpayment of taxes does not change or revert back to an earlier date when the tax payments were remitted because the appeal process has concluded.
A proceeding under the Judicature Act, supra does not create a debt.
There was no right to a refund of overpaid taxes until March 1997 when the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal rendered its decision upholding the reduction in the assessment.
An interest rate of 8.75 % being a rate equatable to the interest rate charged by HRM on overdue taxes (prime plus 4 %) is an appropriate rate on the principal amount of $420,177.13 fro m March 3, 1997 to the date of the refund on September 5, 1997 and on the unpaid interest only from September 6, 1997 to the date of judgment.
I would ask counsel to make the appropriate calculations and subject to any agreement wil l hear the parties as to costs by way of brief written submissions.","The plaintiff paid its municipal property taxes as assessed for three years.
On appeal it was held to be entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total amount of $420,000.
The plaintiff, pursuant to s. 41(I) of the Judicature Act, sought payment of interest on this amount from the date of the payments.
Awarding 5 months interest,
that the date from which interest is calculated in this type of action is upon completion of the appeal process.
An appropriate interest claim under s. 41(I) therefore only exists for the five month period between the Court of Appeal's assessment determination and the refund of the property tax five months later.","[5, 0, 65, 7, 6, 62, 64, 61, 9, 10, 8, 60]"

[1]              This is an application to determine whether this court has jurisdiction to vary a consent order of the Ontario Court (General Division).
[2]              On June 13, 1994 the Ontario Court (General Division) granted judgment by consent which incorporated by reference an agreement made between the separated married couple of Virginia and Russell Walker.
Her claim is based on the equitable grounds of fraud, duress and unconscionability.
The real question embodied in that issue is whether this court has jurisdiction to set aside or vary a consent order of the Ontario court.
Decision On Issue:
Under the circumstances as set out, I find that the Nova Scotia court has jurisdiction to vary the Consent Order of the Ontario court.
Forum Conveniens Issue:
[21]         Ms. Schoen argues that even if this court finds that it has jurisdiction to deal with the matter, the Ontario court would also have jurisdiction to vary the terms of its own order.
No evidence relating to the issue was adduced at the hearing and no affidavits were filed by the parties setting out the facts relied upon for such a finding.

Heard:         June 18, 2009
Present:      Angela Lynn Smith, represented by Tim Hill
Darryl Haley, of Haley & Associates Inc., the Trustee, represented by Rubin Dexter
Introduction
This is an application by Angela Lynn Smith to be discharged from bankruptcy.
Ms. Smith filed a Proposal to Creditors on July 9, 2008 .
As a result she was deemed to have made an assignment in bankruptcy that day.
Her unsecured debts totaled $203,149.
My authority for granting discharges is section 172 of the BIA.
Technically a fact under paragraph 173(1)(0) has been proved.
Conclusion
In summary, Ms. Smith will be entitled to an absolute discharge once the following are done:
She resolves the matter of the horse trailer as provided in paragraph [13] above.
She pays the Trustee $500 for rent.
She provides the Trustee with the VIN number on the 2007 Cobalt vehicle and with the information required to complete the income tax returns which the Trustee is required to file.
She pays the Trustee $300 for the horses.
She pays surplus income as provided in paragraph [60].
Halifax, Nova Scotia
September 1, 2009","The Trustee opposed the bankrupt's application for a discharge on various grounds.
The bankrupt supported four children and had been discharged from the military due to illness arising from her active service.
The bankrupt will be entitled to an absolute discharge once certain conditions are met, including the payment of one month's rent, the value of the horses and surplus income for nine months to the Trustee.
The bankrupt's disability pension from Veterans' Affairs was not included in the calculation of surplus income as the public policy reason behind the exemption for proceeds received due to personal injury and a soldier's danger pay applied to this disability pension.
The Trustee had no claim to the insurance proceeds received by the bankrupt following the loss of her home by fire as it was a modest sum used to replace lost personal exempt assets; the three horses were found to be owned by the bankrupt as opposed to her children, for whom she had purchased them as pets and were included in the value of her estate; the court exercised its discretion in determining the amount of surplus income, noting that the administration of the estate had been unusually hostile and it was important that the bankrupt be able to stabilize her family finances.","[281, 279, 0, 13, 14, 12, 9, 280, 18, 15, 16, 17, 274, 275, 276, 278, 272, 273, 19, 277, 22, 21, 268]"

Docket: SH 257619
Registry: Halifax
Terry E. Taylor
Applicant
Judge:                          The Honourable Justice Arthur J. LeBlanc
In the circumstances, would an objective person have a reasonable apprehension that the justice of the peace would be biased against Mr. Taylor?
The justice of the peace is required to swear an oath whereby he will act impartially in carrying out the duties of his office: see s.6(1) of the Justices of Peace Act.
The last time Mr. McIntyre represented Ms. Taylor was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant.
This militates against an apprehension of bias by a reasonable person.
    I am satisfied that a reasonable person, given all of the facts, would not conclude that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias.
To paraphrase DeRoches J. in Dunn, I am satisfied that Mr. McIntyre would have been capable of disabusing his mind of the previous professional contact with Mrs. Taylor at the time of considering the Application for a search warrant.
Conclusion
For the reasons above, I allow the application to quash the search warrant.
If the parties are unable to agree on costs, I will ask them to submit their representations within three weeks of the date of the filing of this decision.","The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period.
The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales.
Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies.
The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties.
Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance;
there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice.
The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file.
There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","[242, 0, 1, 239, 238, 237, 243, 2, 241, 235, 3, 8, 5, 240, 4, 236]"

I do not read this as a direction to the trial judge to routinely grant all applications for relief from statutory time limitations.
Indeed, such an interpretation is tantamount to adding four years to the prescribed limitation periods as a matter of course.
In the Random House Dictionary, 2nd Ed , discretion is defined as ""The power or right to decide or act according to one's own judgement"".
In my view, had I found in favour of the plaintiff and disallowed the defence under the Limitation of Actions Act I would have abdicated my statutory duty to exercise discretion.
Accordingly, the plaintiff's application to disallow the defence under the Limitations of Actions Act is denied and the action fails on that ground.
Since this disposes of the entire action I deem it unnecessary to rule upon the other preliminary matters which counsel addressed in their submissions.
In the result, the plaintiff's action is dismissed.
Costs will follow the cause.
If necessary, I will accept submissions from counsel respecting quantum of costs.
Judgement Accordingly                      ","The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for breach of contract in regard to the defendants' refusal to return to her the substantial security deposit that she paid as part of a motel lease.
After being clearly told that the money would not be returned, she waited 9 years before commencing the action.
The plaintiff applied for an order disallowing the defendants' limitation defence.
Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed.
The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled.
Not only was there a presumption that the evidence would now be less cogent than it would have been, but the defendants' storage warehouse was destroyed by fire 3 years ago resulting in the loss of many old records, including those relating to the motel.","[159, 0, 158, 156, 1, 2, 155, 3, 5, 157, 4, 154, 7, 6, 151, 153, 8, 150, 9, 152]"

I did not anticipate a stock market downturn of this magnitude or duration.
If both parties are ultimately going to suffer should changes not be made to the terms or implementation of the agreement, then they, of course, are free to amend the agreement.
It is the parties who are best equipped to renegotiate the agreement if it is necessary that the renegotiation occur.
Mr. Grady’s continuing default is not in the interest of either party.
    I do not conclude the circumstances described by Mr. Grady undermine the integrity of the agreement.
I am more inclined to the view that Mr. Grady’s proposal for changing/disregarding the agreement would bring about this result.
    A corollary relief judgement incorporating the support provisions of the parties’ separation agreement will therefore issue.
I understand the parties have agreed upon modifications to the parenting agreement and less significant issues.
I reserve the jurisdiction to rule on any of these issues and others if I am advised that counsel wish that I do so.","The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008.
It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time.
At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment.
The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support.
He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement.
The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce.
The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008).
The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable.
He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife.
The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement.
This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act.
It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome).
The terms of the agreement must be given great deference.
Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act?
The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made.
Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult.
Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated.
Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party.
To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them.
The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it.
The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements.
His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).","[0, 63, 357, 358, 359, 1, 62, 355, 77, 78, 61, 356, 2, 351, 80, 350, 349]"

[3]              In January of 2009, a Consent Order was issued which dealt with most of the issues.
As a result, the only remaining issue was, as acknowledged in the Consent Order, the retroactivity of child maintenance (table and section 7 expenses) for the period from August, 2001, to and including December, 2007.
DECISION
[26]         Ms. Jeffrey applied for relief pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act in October of 2007.
A Consent Order dated January 9, 2009, provided relief to almost all of the issues raised in the proceeding, including ongoing child maintenance beginning January 4, 2008.
What remains for decision is what responsibility, if any, Mr. Jeffrey has to retroactively provide child maintenance since the couple separated in August of 2001 up to the end of 2007.
[44]         Ms. Jeffrey’s request for a retroactive award with regard to the section 7 expenses is denied.
    I assume, as a result of this decision, the Nova Scotia Maintenance Enforcement Program will be in contact with Mr. Jeffrey to make arrangements as to repayment of the arrears.
I would ask counsel for the applicant to prepare the order.","At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007).
Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009.
The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years.
The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines.
She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it.
The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands.
Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward.
The father's hardship arguments rejected.
He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income.
The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient.
Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied.
The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses.
During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family.","[0, 124, 212, 125, 19, 211, 1, 209, 126, 127, 18]"

Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home;
the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice.
There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","[67, 187, 0, 66, 68, 69, 1, 185, 71, 65, 70, 183, 2, 184, 74, 181, 3, 182, 64]"

There is an interim spousal support order of $1,600.00 per month.
She seeks a continuation of spousal support for an indefinite period, claiming she is unable to return to work on account of her medical problems.
I conclude that with professional psychiatric or psychological assistance, she could deal with her depression and anxiety issues, and that the obsessive-compulsive disorder, in itself, does not prevent her from returning to work.
I am satisfied, however, that the other major illnesses and disabilities, particularly irritable bowel syndrome, limit her ability to return to employment.
I find as a fact that Ms. Bishop is unable to return to employment at this time.
Similarly, if Ms. Bishop becomes fit to work, Mr. Bishop will be entitled to seek a variation.
This provides Ms. Bishop with a complete indemnity with respect to the matrimonial debts.

By the Court:
[1]               This is a divorce proceeding.
In such cases the children are either to remain with or be taken into the care of the other parent.
These arrangements may be made as a result of telephone contact but they are to be confirmed eventually by e-mail exchange.
In addition to paragraph 25, the parents may change the parenting plan but to do so they must agree to the changes in writing.
Communication 
Until the parents are ready to communicate either by way of face to face meetings or in telephone conversations, regular communication is to be by e-mail.
The parent having a new topic must send an originating e-mail listing that topic or topics and request a reply.
The parents, either separately, or if they are advised by a counselor, together,  are to engage in a counseling program to improve their communication with each other regarding the parenting of their children.","The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.
 The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody.
She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together.
The level of conflict between the two was high.
Each lived with new partners.
They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall.
The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support.
She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did.
Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months.
This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off.
The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated.
While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not.
The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help).
If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody.
On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children.
The father will pay child support in the set-off amount.
While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her.
It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation.
Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated.
It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father.
She's not entitled to spousal support.
Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","[5, 0, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 548, 542, 543, 31, 36, 38, 539, 37, 34, 544, 540, 546, 33]"

By the Court:
She also seeks costs .
She advocated at the interim hearing that she undertook this with the strong support of her parents.
This may in fact continue for the foreseeable future if she continues to pursue her degree in Moncton.
Spousal support is reviewable in the event those circumstances change.
These moves have significant financial implications and these implications must be addressed in advance in order to maintain this child’s contact with both parents and avoid the need for litigation after the fact.
The spousal support award is also reviewable at the end of her current degree.
Long term support is not called for in these circumstances.
Support is also reviewable  upon a change in circumstances and/or  access regime.
Counsel for the Respondent shall draft the order.
The parties may make submissions on costs after the custody and access issues are settled by court order or agreement of the parties.
Justice Moira Legere Sers","The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage.
The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment.
The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child.
The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home.
Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs.
Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent.
Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues.
The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills.
Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity.
The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","[341, 0, 3, 337, 339, 5, 338, 2, 340, 334, 333, 336, 7, 9, 8, 4, 1, 6, 12, 10, 14, 327, 11, 329]"

Issue No. 2:  Is the supplier of materials to the sub-contractor entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond?
Paragraph 4 of the Labour & Material Payment Bond limits the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to a claimant such as Hazmasters not having a contract directly with the principal.
Liability is limited to the amount which the Principal would have been obliged to pay to the claimant if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c.277, applied to the work.
I accept the submissions on behalf of London Guarantee.
In the result, if the Mechanics' Lien Act had been applicable, Hazmasters would not have been entitled to recover anything due to the third party statutory liens.
DISPOSITION
The claims of Hazmasters against Rideau Construction and London Guarantee are both dismissed.
in contradiction.
Therefore, Hazmasters will pay the costs of Rideau Construction and London Guarantee which, because they are represented by the same counsel, will be a single amount as may be agreed upon between counsel or, if agreement is not possible, will be set by the Court at the time an Order for Judgment is taken out.","After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, the plaintiff, a supplier of materials to the sub-contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub-contractor.
The Bond contained a provision limiting the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to any claimant not having a contract directly with the principal.
Dismissing the action with costs,
that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier.
With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work.
As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff.
Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond.","[5, 114, 0, 113, 74, 10, 123, 6, 75, 115, 122, 112, 76]"

Phyllis Gilbert
Appellant
[66]         Gilbert, in her factum, suggests that to determine vicarious liability we must ask and answer the questions raised by the “Bazley tests”.
Bazley was commenting on the relevant factors to be considered when determining vicarious liability related to intentional torts in an employment setting (see Bazley, supra, p. 41).
The relevant factors will vary on a case-by-case analysis.
The trial judge committed no error in his determination that Chrysler was not liable for the negligence of Giffin.
For all of these reasons, I would dismiss these grounds of appeal.
Conclusion
I would dismiss both appeals with costs to the respondents in the amount of $1,500.00 plus taxable disbursements; one-half of that amount is to be paid by each appellant.

Reasons for judgment:
In paragraph [53], sub-paragraph 3., second line, substitute the word “contact” with the word “conduct”.","The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff.
The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle.
The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence.
The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee.
Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","[284, 308, 285, 307, 1, 0, 286, 306, 27, 26, 283, 16, 287, 280, 2, 28, 281, 31, 29, 279, 282, 278, 305, 30, 275, 277]"

First, if you believe the evidence of the accused, obviously you must acquit.
Second, if you do not believe the testimony of the accused but you are left in reasonable doubt by it, you must acquit.
Third, even if you are not left in doubt by the evidence of the accused, you must ask yourself whether, on the basis of the evidence which you do accept, you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by that evidence of the guilt of the accused.
The adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.
In this case the evidence before the adjudicator was clearly capable of being evidence to the contrary so as to raise a reasonable doubt.
The adjudicator failed to examine the evidence in this light and make findings of credibility based on the weight of the evidence before him.
I allow this appeal of the conviction.
I find it would be impractical to order a new trial at this date and accordingly order that a verdict of acquittal be entered.
Justice M. Heather Robertson","The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended.
The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle.
Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal entered.
The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle.
But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.","[111, 0, 110, 108, 1, 107, 109, 2, 106, 3, 5, 105, 104, 4, 103]"

It is fundainental to the case, defendant counsel argues, that if the employee breaks the law ""he is on his own"".
DISPOSITION
The common law doctrine of respondeat superior recognizes an employee acting within the scope of his duties is an instrument of his einployer's will.
Employees are to be reimbursed for losses, liabilities or expenses incurred in the course of employment.
This right to indemnification has limitations as expressed in Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th edition Volume 16 at para.
      Implied duty to indemnify employee.
The plaintiff is not entitled to be reimbursed for his fine.
The defendant is not entitled to receive payment from the plaintiff monies paid by the defendant to Warren Zimmer.
Costs are in the discretion of the court and should follow the event.
It has been determined in this province that the costs of a counterclaim should be limited to the extent the counterclaim increased the cost of the proceeding.
The substantial portion of this proceeding involved the plaintiff's attempt to recover his legal fees from the defendant.
It seems appropriate to assess the amount involved at the approximate difference between the amounts recovered ‑ $8,000.00.
The defendant shall pay costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $1,550.00.","The plaintiff was for 15 years the Town Clerk of the defendant municipality.
He sought indemnity for legal expenses he incurred as a result of charges he faced for violation of s. 368 of the Criminal Code and s. 27 of the Municipal Affairs Act.
The criminal charge was dropped when he plead guilty to Municipal Affairs Act charge, of diverting money from the special reserve fund for an unauthorized purpose.
The defendant counterclaimed for monies it had already paid to the plaintiff.
Awarding the defendant $13,502, and the defendant $5,351 on the counterclaim,
that the defendant should not reimburse the plaintiff for expenses arising out of the plea of guilty on the Municipal Affairs Act charge, as the plaintiff admitted to his mistake.

As Justice Binnie has said, such effects should not be assumed and in this case have not been established.
It appears to me that the amendment of the category of liquor license is a ""reasonable evolution of prior activities"".
""That change, within reasonable limits should be accommodated"".
Mr. Justice Binnie said that there will be an element of subjective judgment in considering the criteria mentioned above but should not turn on personal value judgments.
The court should attempt to ground its decision on objective facts.
In my view, the change of liquor license sought by the applicant will not constitute a change of use from that presently enjoyed by the applicant.
Subject to the regulations of the Nova Scotia Liquor Control Board, the applicant is permitted to operate a licensed billiard club open to the public at 192 Highway #2, Enfield, Nova Scotia.
I will receive written submissions from the parties with respect to the matter of costs.","The applicant operated commercial private billiards club with liquor licence and served bar food.
The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation.
The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement.
The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use.
Application granted;
the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change.
There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed.","[7, 11, 252, 248, 0, 9, 8, 250, 10, 246, 12, 247, 2, 245, 13, 251, 243]"

Section 266(3) of the Municipal Government Act provides:
I find that there was proportionality between the effects of the measures limiting the respondents’ freedom of expression and the objective of the by-law.
It really only required that any limitation did not prevent all expression, but only that relating to a location in order to advance the objective of protecting the community.
    I am of the opinion that limits on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 2(b) of the Charter are demonstrably justified pursuant to s. 1 of the Charter.
The application is allowed and an order will issue pursuant to s. 266(3) of the Municipal Government Act directing the respondents to remove the ground sign.
If not removed within 15 days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents.
Costs will be awarded at $1,500 against all respondents.","The applicant applied for an order directing the removal of a ground sign which violated its' Municipal Planning Strategy and Land Use By-laws.
The respondents argued that the applicant's by-law violated their rights under s. 2(b) of the Charter.
Application allowed; respondents directed to remove the ground sign; if the sign is not removed within fifteen days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents.
Although advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of sec. 2(b) of the Charter, the purposes of the by-laws (maintaining a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown, minimizing adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reducing safety concerns) were both pressing and substantial and the limiting measures were rationally connected to the objectives.
The by-laws had a minimal impairment on the rights of the respondents, as advertising was not prohibited but only limited.","[0, 8, 141, 9, 10, 139, 11, 142, 138, 140, 137, 12, 13, 15, 14, 19, 16]"

Background
According to the CMHC insurance certificate prepared at the time of acquisition of both properties by the defendant, the attic of the apartments were divided into two sections by a firewall running north and south along the ceiling hallway dividing the eastern portion of the roof from the western portion.
The photos revealed the south-west corner of the roof received the heaviest fire damage.
Damages - Ms. Leslie
I assess Ms. Leslie’s general damages in the amount of $55,000.00.
Loss of Valuable Services
Following her release from hospital in October 2006,  Ms. Leslie resided with her sister and relied upon her for care.
In the circumstances, I find that amount to be reasonable.
Loss of Future Income and Earning Capacity
Ms. Leslie, now 30 years of age, was unemployed at the time of the accident and was receiving social assistance benefits.
She currently remains unemployed and continues receiving social assistance.
Total                                                $165,000.00
The plaintiffs shall recover pre-judgment interests  and costs.
I will accept written submissions in the event the parties are unable to agree.","The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building.
The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility.
The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula.
He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports.
Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion.
The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib.
She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip.
She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp.
The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder.
The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions.
Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income.
Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire.
Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue.
When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs.
Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs.
The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.","[0, 14, 724, 760, 725, 759, 692, 726, 723, 15, 521, 693, 758, 216, 691, 1, 34]"

Creating and maintaining a safe and healthy workplace is a requirement of law; it is not an option.
In my view, crafting an appropriate sentence in this case should send a message that vigilance is required at all times and that mistaken assumptions about workplace safety may have dangerous, and sometimes, tragic consequences.
Mr. Eagles knew the requirements of the legislation and turned his mind to what was required to be done, but his misplaced trust in a labourer to do as he was directed to do led to his failure to adequately supervise and ultimately to his failure to inspect fall protection measures before work commenced at that end of the work platform.
Finally, in terms of the rehabilitation, reform and the educational aspects of this order and I would also request that the overview outline how the presentations evolved after the parties received and reviewed the feedback.
Theodore K. Tax. J.P.C.","The on-site supervisor was convicted of two offences under the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter of the work area and failing to ensure that an intermediate or 'mid' guardrail was installed) after a mason was killed when he fell from scaffolding on the job site.
Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell.
The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew.
In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations.
The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard.
This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard.
Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall.","[10, 0, 187, 176, 1, 13, 186, 175, 174, 11, 9]"

They have their own code of conduct and regard themselves as the best and final guarantors of their own safety.
[21]         Chad Zinck was obviously an example of that type of rugged individualism.
No one ordered him to make that dive; he wanted to do it; and he insisted on doing it against the advice of others more knowledgeable and experienced.
This was a classic case of someone being the author of his own misfortune, and to hold the defendant or any other of his co-fishers responsible for his health and safety would be to arrogate to them a degree of control they simply did not possess.
If the legislature means to include fishers as employers or employees under this Act, it should do so specifically and inform the industry in advance of that change in policy.
Conclusion
I find the defendant not guilty of the offence charged.","The defendant was charged, as an employer, with failing to take reasonable precautions to ensure the health and safety of persons at a workplace.
The defendant and three others had set out to check a tuna pen.
The boat was owned by a fourth individual, who was not present at the time.
One of the men, despite having no experience diving with scuba equipment and being advised against it by the others, insisted on diving to check the pen.
He died of drowning due to inexperienced scuba diving.
Defendant not guilty of the offence charged; the defendant was not the deceased's employer.
All four individuals thought of themselves as self-employed fishermen and had a profit-sharing agreement; the evidence did not establish that the defendant was acting as skipper or captain in the owner's absence; the defendant was not operating the vessel and the evidence did not show that the defendant had any kind of authority over the other fishers.
The deceased was dependant on the boat's owner for the boat and part of the gear, for another individual for the licence and on the defendant for the balance of the gear; the relationship was closer to that of independent contractor than that of employer-employee.","[88, 0, 1, 87, 2, 3, 4, 86, 5, 83, 84, 6, 85, 7, 82, 8, 9]"

The Plaintiffs are jointly and severely liable for payment of these costs which may be deducted from their respective entitlements in the estate.
Order accordingly.","The plaintiffs sought a detailed accounting from their sister of her dealings with their mother's financial affairs pursuant to a Power of Attorney prior to the mother's death.

It also involves consideration of a request from both counsel for the respondents that the appeal be dismissed with costs to be awarded on a solicitor and client basis.
Background
[2]        Dorothy Crouse, a widow of Lunenburg, in her last will of September 16, 1995, appointed Edmund R. Saunders, the appellant, sole executor of her estate.
She died on September 13, 1997.
[3]        Mr. Saunders had practised law for in excess of forty years before his retirement in the early 1990's.
The will was submitted to probate on September 15, 1997.
On September 4, 1998, Mr. Saunders wrote the residuary legatees stating, in part:
As such, this proceeding is an abuse of the appeal process.
We would classify the matter before us as one of those rare and exceptional cases in which solicitor and client costs should be ordered.
Conclusion
The appeal is dismissed with costs as between solicitor and client awarded to the respondent, Merilyn Hendry, as well as to the respondent Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church.
These costs to be taxed are to be paid forthwith by the appellant, Edmund R. Saunders, personally.
Concurred in:","One of the residual legatees of the respondent estate filed a petition under s. 31(1) of the Probate Act.
At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.'
The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act.
The executor appealed.
He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security.
Dismissing the appeal,
that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding.
This was also one of those rare occasions where solicitor and client costs on the appeal were warranted, as the executor's actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which the Court termed reprehensible and unconscionable.","[15, 119, 117, 16, 17, 116, 18, 114, 115, 113, 20, 19, 21, 24]"

[1]              This is an Application for an Order removing Joan McGean as one of the Personal representatives of the Estate of David Raphael McGean.
Those are the terms that bound the intestate.
They now bind his Estate.
There is no reason to remove Joan McGean as personal representative of the Estate because there is no feasible action for the Estate to pursue.
    I am therefore dismissing the application.
Jean McGean failed to respond to the notice on the original scheduled date for hearing.
She therefore necessitated a second date.
The Applicants needlessly incurred costs on the original date because of Joan McGean’s failure to respond.
Joan McGean is entitled to costs for the second day but these are offset by the expense she caused the Applicants on the first date.
The parties therefore will each bear their respective costs.
Order accordingly.","The intestate's biological child, who was one of the personal representatives of the estate, wished to sue the intestate's former employer to have the pension to which he was entitled at the time of his death paid into the estate.
The other personal representative of the estate, who was the intestate's spouse, was in receipt of survivor benefits under the pension and, as such, was opposed to the intended court action.
The biological child applied to have his stepmother removed as a personal representative of the estate.
Application dismissed;
the removal of the personal representative would only be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate if the intended lawsuit was feasible, which it was not.
The estate was bound by the terms of the pension plan, which provided that the respondent was clearly entitled, as the spouse of the intestate, to survivor benefits and the payment of a lump sum into her estate if she died within five years of the intestate's retirement.","[0, 76, 1, 75, 2, 74, 73, 3, 4, 72, 5, 71, 70, 6, 69, 7, 8, 68, 67, 9, 10, 11]"

In this case, I find the Real Estate Brokers Licensing Act has no application because the agreement was made in April, 1997 after this Act was repealed on January 21, 1997.   
I find the Real Estate Trading Act, Chapter 28, 1999 R.S.N.S. applies to this agreement.
Section 31 of the Real Estate Trading Act reads:            
Requirements respecting agreements
Every agreement entered into by a licensed person for the purchase or sale of real estate shall
(a)        contain an expiry date; and
(b)         be executed by all parties to the agreement,
On the claim for unjust enrichment, I set the amount at $35,000.00.            
I set the rate for pre judgment interest at 4.4% per annum.
Any determination on costs will be reserved as I indicated I would hear the parties at a later date re the dismissal of the claim against Mrs. Murphy.

[2]              Four grounds of appeal are set out:
(a)  the decision was quickly made which did not reflect the time needed to consider the totality of the evidence presented.
What is the likelihood that the appellant has or will have the resources to pay the costs.
Again, the decision in Jaswal, supra, beginning at paragraph 40, and in Creager at paragraphs 96 and 97, are relevant.            
Applying the standard of review of reasonableness to the Committee’s findings of unprofessional conduct, the court dismisses the appeal.
This court makes no comment on the appropriateness of the sanctions that were imposed.
The absence of reasons makes it impossible to assess the decision.
Obviously, however, a primary concern should be the protection of the public and thereby the integrity of the real estate profession.
The court will hear the parties with respect to costs if requested.
J","A real estate agent sold a condominium to an American and agreed to rent it for her for a fee.
He deposited a security deposit and rent in his personal account and used it for personal living expenses.
When the owner inquired, he caused a false lease to be provided to her showing the rental commencing two months later than it actually did; he then failed to remit some rent and was late remitting other rent.
He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission.
At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible.
The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000.
The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed.
Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision.

APPEARANCES
For the Landlord - self-represented
For the Tenant - self-represented
[1]               This is an appeal from an order of the Director dated December 13, 2007.
That order allowed the Tenant the sum of $787.50 against the Landlord as compensation arising from what the Director found to be a breach of the statutory condition to provide a premises suitable for habitation.
In particular the Director found that the Landlord allowed mouldy conditions in the premises to develop and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the Tenant’s belongings were ruined.
[2]               The Landlord did not attend the hearing before the Director.
The Director also discounted the property damage claims on the basis that the furniture’s value should be discounted, and because of the lack of evidence of the other items.
I have concluded that the Director was essentially correct, although her discounting of the value of the rug and clothing went a little too far, in my opinion.
Because the matter is before me on a de novo basis I assess the damages a little higher.
I would allow $712.50 for the furniture, $50.00 for the area rug and $100.00 for the clothing, for a total of $862.50.
The Tenant will accordingly be entitled to a judgment against the Landlord for that revised amount.
Eric K. Slone, Adjudicator","The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined.
The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould.
It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting.
Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased;
the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings.
The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","[61, 15, 60, 16, 14, 17, 18, 58, 59, 11, 57, 19, 20, 21, 55]"

For the Landlord - Jim Lorimer, President
For the Tenant - self-represented
BY THE COURT:
[1]               This case raises an interesting and perhaps important issue under residential tenancy law, and in particular what it means when a Landlord has been directed not to withhold consent in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner.
As I indicated at the hearing, my inclination is to defer making a finding as to the state of the tenancy for a short period of time, to allow the parties to negotiate a suitable compromise.
As such, I will give them one week from the date that this decision is communicated to them.
If after that week they have not reached an understanding, which they would be directed to convey to the court, then I will complete my findings and determine the existing state of the tenancy.
Eric K. Slone, Adjudicator
                                                 ADDENDUM
The parties were unfortunately unable to come to an agreement on the issue of when this lease would terminate.
I must therefore decide the issue, with aid of their written submissions.
In the unique circumstances of this case, it is appropriate that the Tenant and not the Landlord incur that risk.
[29]         Of course, it is speculative as to whether there will be any period of vacancy or any financial consequences, but the parties at least understand now what is required of them.
Eric K. Slone, Adjudicator","The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31.
Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy.
The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st.
The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families.
It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students.
The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months.
After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful.
The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable.
The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty.
The officer erred in law.
The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably.
The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy.
There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld.
The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31).
Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","[95, 76, 77, 94, 75, 74, 16, 17, 93, 18, 73, 19, 72, 78, 20]"

The Claim
The Claimant claims $25,000.00 for damages.
The reason for the claim is ‑""claim for damages‑house sale ‑ disclosure statement did not disclose a history of repeated flooding.""
The Claimant said this was a minor problem and the Defendants did not disclose that the place had flooded in the past.
The Claimant stated the basement had flooded on at least one occasion.
In fact there is no evidence of non-disclosure and in the case at bar, the opposite is the case.
In this case the Claimant made no inquiry about the statement made by the Defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation.
To conclude there is no evidence of misrepresentation
There is evidence that the Defendants were aware that there was a cistern and did not disclose this to the Claimant but there is no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing a problem.
There is no warranty, collateral or otherwise, in this agreement that provides the Claimant comfort that there was no leakage, or would be no leakage.
For all these reasons the motion will succeed and the claim against the Defendants fails.
Dated at Halifax, this 20 day of March, 2008.
David T.R. Parker
Small Claims Court Adjudicator","The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding. 
Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt.
She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation.
When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony.
Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed;
it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation.
The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries.
There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot.

At issue was whether the appeal was properly before the court or premature.
There was also an issue concerning the admissibility of an affidavit that wasn't before the adjudicator at the original proceeding.
Appeal dismissed and matter returned for a continuation of the hearing on the merits before the same adjudicator.
The court has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal on an interlocutory decision of this nature.
There can be no appeal from the Small Claims Court until a final determination is made.
Until this matter is decided on its merits, there has been no final determination.
There are sound policy, as well as practical, reasons for this approach.","[0, 37, 93, 36, 110, 1, 111, 35, 2, 92, 34]"

INDERJEET SANDHU
Defendants
REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
From the evidence at trial that I accept, I am prepared to find the following material facts:
(1)        Rajbir Sandhu and Inderjeet Sandhu were married on March 6, 1960 following a traditional Sikh religious wedding ceremony;
(3)        Inderjeet never received any notice of any divorce proceedings contemplated or commenced by Rajbir;
(4)        A gradual estrangement developed between Rajbir and Inderjeet on account of Rajbir’s extra-marital relationship with Marcelle Cendres;
Such was never revealed to Rajbir Sandhu.
I find that had Rajbir been fully informed he would have made adequate and generous provision for her maintenance and support in his will.
Here again Raj renewed his promise to provide for Inderjeet and their son.
In light of these circumstances and an estate worth more than $3 Million it would offend all notions of decency, fairness and equity to deny a significant award to Inderjeet Sandhu for her proper maintenance and support.
CONCLUSION
It was a privilege for me to hear of your exceptional lives and accomplishments, and be offered a brief glimpse of your faith, ancestry and culture, about which you should be justly proud.","A wife claimed part of the estate of her estranged husband.
The Court considered the applicability of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, the Matrimonial Property Act, and the Pension Benefits Act.
Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate,
that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed.
To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement.
The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator.
This involves a very broad judicial discretion.
Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance.","[0, 5, 672, 12, 461, 460, 464, 659, 660, 462, 656, 6, 661, 465, 654]"

REASONS FOR JUDGEMENT BY: CROMWELL, J.A. (Orally)                        ","The respondent grocery store was charged with selling tobacco to a person under the age of 19, contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act.
The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial.
The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province.
He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails.
The trial judge further commented that, had the Act been constitutional, he would have convicted because he did not accept the accused's defence of due diligence.
The Crown appealed, and the accused cross-appealed.
Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial,
that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction.
It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act.
The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires.
The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence.
The question is not, as the trial judge thought, whether the employee who sold the tobacco was duly diligent, but whether the accused, her employer, exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent the commission of the offence, and by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system.","[89, 82, 81, 67, 12, 2, 88, 83, 80, 14, 68, 13, 3, 11, 79, 69, 64, 16, 17, 63, 62, 15, 84]"

The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift.
The mother of the deceased appealed.

although the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed, the appellant had failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death.

Analysis: I am satisfied that J.D. intended to make a separate bequest to each individual child.
I am sure that this interpretation is in accord with a fair and literal meaning of the actual language of the will.
J.D.’s Will does identify the class (i.e. “children”) but he also identifies the members of that class by naming each of his five children.
By constructing the clause in the manner he did, J.D. was simply leaving no doubt as to which Jane, Nancy, Heather, Richard or Greg he was referring to.  
    A bequest to the named children is in contrast to the gift in the residue clause to “my grandchildren.”
The latter is a typical class gift as the grandchildren are not named.
Only the survivors of that class, or those added (if any) between the making of the Will and J.D.’s death, will inherit.
    I am unable to discern a “contrary intention” in J.D.’s Will.
Counsel have urged me to find that Clause 11 does describe a contrary intention.
Order accordingly.","The testator had prepared his own Will on a pre-printed form and left his assets to his children, whom he then proceeded to name.
One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will.
the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it.
The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention.
Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception.
In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class.
This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given.
The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will.","[148, 173, 0, 147, 145, 146, 144, 149, 2, 141, 3, 142, 139, 4, 5, 6]"

[6]              There is no dispute about the standard by which we should review these questions on appeal.
The question of whether WCAT applied the correct legal test in this case (the first issue) is reviewed for correctness.
How it applied that test in light of the evidence in this record (the issue raised by the second and third grounds of appeal) is reviewed according to the reasonableness standard.
Counsel agree that this is consistent with the principles very recently enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 (CanLII).
The appellant submits that WCAT was wrong to rely on these cases as they did not deal with an objective assessment of stressors in the context of gradual onset stress but rather with what could constitute a traumatic event.
B.               Second Issue: Did WCAT unreasonably fail to give weight to the opinion of the worker’s treating psychologist?
In light of that finding, for which there is plausible support in the record, the worker’s claim for gradual onset stress could not succeed.
C.      Third Issue: Did WCAT Unreasonably Fail to Give Weight to the Expert Evidence?
Concurred in:","The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy.
The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant.
Appeal dismissed;
the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress.
The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","[194, 201, 0, 36, 35, 1, 34, 2, 193, 33, 178, 3, 132]"

Counsel for the Board acknowledges that in order for its appeal to succeed, it must show that entitlement to chronic pain benefits involves a recalculation within the meaning of s. 228.
When the new Act came into effect in February 1996, chronic pain was not compensable.
There was no entitlement whatsoever for benefits for chronic pain prior to the Chronic Pain Regulations in 2004.
Hence, there could be no benefit which would be recalculated.
Section 228 has no application to payment of chronic pain benefits for injuries during the window period.
Nor is entitlement under s. 9 of the Chronic Pain Regulations restricted to an effective date of November 26, 1992.
There is no authority which prevents the payment of benefits for chronic pain for a period prior to that date.

The complainant said that the sexual activities started out as fondling and eventually to full sexual intercourse.
She also testified that the appellant attempted anal intercourse with her but she said she thought that he was unsuccessful.

THE COURT:      Appeal allowed, verdict set aside and new trial ordered on the indictment, per oral reasons for judgment of Hallett, J.A.; Jones and Chipman, JJ.A. concurring.
The reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered orally by:
This is an appeal from a conviction of first degree murder.
We agree with counsel that the trial judge's instruction to the jury contained several serious errors; the most serious being the instruction as to the requisite intent for murder.
The trial judge failed to instruct the jury that nothing short of the accused's subjective foresight of death can found a conviction for murder (R. v. Martineau (1990), 1990 CanLII 80 (SCC), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 353).
Furthermore, the instruction given could have left the jury with the impression that the appellant could be convicted of murder if it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he attacked Smith and was merely careless whether he killed him or not.

This is an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife.
The evidence indicates the respondent had come to visit his estranged wife on August 18, 1990.
Therefore, I am of the opinion the respondent ""should have been found guilty but for the error in law"" which I have identified.
I would set aside the acquittal and enter a verdict of guilty pursuant to the powers vested in this Court by Section 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code.
Both counsel requested that if a guilty verdict were entered the matter should be remitted to the trial judge for sentence so that a pre‑sentence report could be prepared.
I would make such an order directing the trial judge to impose a sentence that is warranted in law.

Appellant
Respondent
REASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY: HALLETT, J.A.",", The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife.
The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault.
Allowing the appeal,
that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity.
The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward.
The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","[1, 0, 166, 171, 165, 157, 11, 155, 156, 3, 164, 167, 170, 13, 158, 4, 152, 14, 151, 150, 10, 148, 149]"

COUNSEL:   J. Scott 
It is at most evidence from which a court might conclude that that level could at the time of the alleged offence have been different from the level in the certificate.
I do not find that the learned Provincial Court Judge misinterpreted the evidence ""to the contrary"".
I find she applied the correct principles of law in relation to the evidence of the expert and the evidence of alcohol consumption.
I do not find that the trial judge failed to instruct herself as to the admissibility or weight of the evidence relating to alcohol consumption by the accused.
She concludes her decision as follows:
I am satisfied that in applying the burden the learned trial judge properly instructed herself on the law, that is, that the burden is on the Crown to establish the case beyond a reasonable doubt.
I find generally that the verdict of the learned trial judge was a verdict based on all
the evidence, one which a jury properly instructed and acting judicially could reasonably have rendered I therefore dismiss the appeal

Third Parties
The Law
The solicitor and client relationship was with VGM or Amherst Aerospace, or any of their other corporate names.
I am not aware of any case in which the solicitor‑and­-client confidence of a corporate client automatically extended to its directors.
The Nature of the Information
If my conclusions are correct, then it is not necessary to consider Mr. Justice Sopinka's second question; i.e., is there a risk that the information will be used to the prejudice of the client.
Witnesses
Such a possibility does not disqualify Mr. Pink. (See Phoenix v. Metcalfe, 1974 CanLII 1704 (BC CA), [1974]
Costs
There will, therefore, be no extra costs awarded with respect to this matter and the costs will be costs in the cause.","The solicitor for the plaintiff union had been a partner of the law firm which incorporated the defendant company and was under a general retainer to them.
Several of the defendants made application to have the plaintiff s solicitor removed as solicitor of record claiming this was a conflict of interest.
Dismissing the application,
that the test in such circumstances is whether the public represented by the reasonably informed person would be satisfied that no use of confidential information would occur.
To do so it must be shown that a solicitor client relationship existed.
There must not be a danger of the confidential information coming back to haunt the client.
The court found that such a relationship did not exist in this instance.
In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that the solicitor received information which is relevant to the matter at hand.
The court found no such evidence of this possibility.
It is no bar to representation by a solicitor that some former partners at a previous firm will be examined for discovery or called to testify.","[0, 24, 23, 212, 219, 28, 25, 22, 46, 29, 208, 193, 211, 209, 21, 192, 141, 191, 45, 1]"

The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana contrary to Sections 4(2) and 6(2) of the Narcotic Control Act.
The respondents alleged that their Charter rights under s. 8, to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure, had been violated.
In this case, it is my opinion that, having regard to all the circumstances, the respondents did not satisfy the onus of establishing that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
The respondents did not meet the burden of proving that the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute by the admission of the evidence, so it should have been admitted.

RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road.
They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants.
At trial, the court held their right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure had been violated, and acquitted them.
The Crown appealed the acquittal.
Per Roscoe, J.A., Chipman, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial,
that there was no s. 8 breach because the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the field where the marijuana crop was growing.
The court reviewed case law regarding 'open fields', and 'uncultivated' lands, and adopted the reasoning in Oliver v. United States, 104 S.Ct.1735(1984) in reaching its conclusion.

Forum Non Comveniens
In this regard it is necessary to determine which jurisdiction is more convenient for the respective parties.
I must consider the location of prospective witnesses, the location of evidence and the effect those factors will have on the convenience and expense of the trial to each of the parties.

(iv)  for political, racial, religious or other reasons be unlikely to get a fair trial; and
Whether the foreign court is able to deal with the issues.

This is an action for damages for injuries suffered by the plaintiff as a result of a motor vehicle accident which occurred on May 31, 1988.
With respect to the lower back injury, I find that the plaintiff is entitled to an award in the amount of $75,000; however, not all of this is attributable to the defendant's negligence.
I find that the defendant is liable for 33.33 percent of this sum and, accordingly, the plaintiff shall receive $25,000 for her lower back injury.
As to loss of income, I find that the plaintiff has lost income in the amount of $102,753.92 for the years 1988 to 1992.
The defendant is liable for 33.33 percent of this sum which translates to $34,251 less $3,945.88 for section B benefits paid to the plaintiff.
Accordingly, the total amount for loss of income is fixed at $30,305.12.

In this case, I do not believe that section 8 of the Charter can be answered without also examining section 9. in these circumstances there has to be a 'stopping' before a search can be initiated.
A 'stopping' can be a detention and, if arbitrary, would be contrary to section 9.
After a 'stopping' a search would begin when the constable looks into the detainee's motor vehicle and, without grounds would be unreasonable and contrary to section 8.
On the evidence here, the learned trial judge did not give consideration to the potential application of section 9.
It appears to me that the stopping of the appellant's motor vehicle was arbitrary and, therefore, the appellant was being 'arbitrarily detained' contrary to the Charter.
It was from this arbitrary detention that the search (questions, requests and observations of the appellant) of the appellant was made, followed by the determination of the constable that there was 'reasonable and probable grounds' for the making of the demand.

She found as a fact the appellants ability to drive was impaired by alcohol.
I find the trial judge applied the correct test for impairment.
I find she did not err.
As to whether the trial judge utilized the absence of evidence from the appellant to conclude the appellant was impaired, I find she did not.
To understand her comments you must read them together and consider the fact she was responding to speculations made by defence counsel during his summation.
I find the trial judge committed no err.
I dismiss the appeal with costs in the amount of $300.00 to the Crown which will be payable to the Clerk of the Crown on or before June 30, 1995 who will then disburse it to the Crown.","The appellant appealed his conviction for impaired driving, contending the trial judge failed to direct herself in law as to the appropriate burden of proof.
Dismissing the appeal,
that the trial judge applied the correct test for impairment.
The Criminal Code does not prescribe special tests for determining impairment.
The trial judge must receive sufficient evidence to satisfy him or herself beyond reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.

Respondent
1.         BACKGROUND
Their backyard abuts the Bedford Highway.
The expropriation resolution was filed at the Registry on September 7, 1993, the effective date of expropriation.
Issue 4.         Did the learned Taxing Master err in principle respecting the interest on unpaid legal accounts?
I have provided counsel with a copy of my unreported decision in Charles Hardy Appraisals Limited it.
Ancaster Holdings Limited, file 93‑194 rendered orally April 29, 1994.
In that case Hardy sought payment of interest as designated on its invoices in the following terms:
There was no term in the contract mandating interest, and I concluded:
""In the absence of evidence clearly establishing an entitlement to interest on default of payment being acknowledged and accepted by Ancaster Holdings Limited, it is not recoverable.""
Traditionally a barrister did not charge interest on his/her accounts, however, modem practice is for almost all commercial accounts to have some reference to interest on overdue balances stated on invoices.
The mere statement of an interest term on an invoice by itself raises no legal obligation for payment of such interest, and the Taxing Master was correct in declining any award of invoice interest.
    RESULT
The appeal is dismissed, and the taxation of costs by the Taxing Master confirmed.","The respondent expropriated a parcel of land owned by the appellant.
Prior to a hearing, all claims for the case were settled for the sum of $20,000.
The appellant's solicitor presented solicitor and client accounts of $19,420 plus taxes.
The respondent directed taxation, and the appellant's solicitor submitted further accounts for services and disbursements of the taxation hearing amounting to $7,212.24.
The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000.
He proceeded to tax the account at $14,000, disallowed any costs of the taxation hearing, and disallowed a claim for interest on interim accounts submitted by the solicitor.
The appellants appealed.
Dismissing the appeal and confirming the taxation,
that the taxing master did not make any errors in law.
He was entitled to consider as one of the relevant factors the relationship of the total account to the recovery.","[5, 175, 15, 0, 174, 173, 171, 170, 19, 168, 167, 166, 17, 165, 172]"

RELEASE OF
ARGUMENT
At the time of his termination, was the plaintiff owed any arrears of salary?
The plaintiff submits at the time of his termination, in November 1991, Allstate was, in effect, one month in arrears in paying him compensation.
The plaintiff suggests that since compensation is calculated, in part, on the basis of the prior month's productivity, he would not have received commissions for the sales generated by him during the month of October, 1991.
The submission of the plaintiff is without merit and involves a misunderstanding as to the true nature of the terms of compensation as between himself and Allstate.
However, and as already reviewed, we have declined to apply the principle or notion of ""ball park justice"", but rather to adopt the approach suggested by the authors of Sproat, Employment Law, supra.
In doing so, we recognize that absent knowledge of the salary continuation the plaintiff has already received, and in view of the imprecise nature of the determination of reasonable notice, the award of reasonable notice could have as likely been for fifteen months as for fourteen months.
The amount in issue is therefore the equivalent of five months salary.","The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years.
As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation.
The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages.
He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal.
The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages.
Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months.
Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified.
Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable.
Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears.
Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.","[0, 10, 70, 71, 74, 311, 72, 69, 307, 308]"

ALLEN WADE SPIDELL
This is an appeal by the appellant, Allen Wade Spidell, against a decision of The Honourable Judge Anne E. Crawford dated October 24, 1995 wherein she convicted the appellant of an offence that:
""At or near Auburndale, in the County of Lunenburg, Province of Nova Scotia, did unlawfully, without reasonable excuse, refuse to comply with the demand made to him by Constable Gary Jonathan White, a Peace Officer, to provide then or as soon thereafter as is practicable, samples of his blood as in the opinion of a qualified medical practitioner were necessary to enable a proper analysis to be made, in order to determine the concentration, if any, of alcohol in his blood, contrary to Section 254(5) of the Criminal Code of Canada.""
Did the trial judge err when she found the appellant's rights under Section
7 and 8 of the Charter had not been breached?
The trial judge, after reviewing R. v. Dersh 1993 CanLII 32 (SCC), [1993]
I also find the trial judge did not err when she found the appellant's right under Section 7 were not violated.
I therefore dismiss the appeal.
I direct the appellant pay costs to the Crown in the amount of $300.00 by paying same to the Clerk of the Crown on or before March 1, 1996.","This was an appeal from a trial court decision questioning whether the trial judge erred in determining that the appellant's rights under s.7 and s.8 of the Charter had not been violated.
When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital.
As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain.
The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer.
Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code.
The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter.
Dismissing the appeal,
that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter.
The trial judge did not err in determining that the appellant's rights were not violated under either s.7 or s.8 of the Charter.","[0, 37, 65, 1, 38, 64, 63, 39, 17, 16]"

Kevin Riley
Appellant
REASONS FOR
JUDGMENT BY: ","The appellant appealed his sentence of five months in prison to be followed by 18 months probation following his plea of guilty to the theft of his grandmother's car.
Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing.
The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail.
The appellant was allowed to file affidavits as to the his progress concerning his problems with drugs and alcohol.
Per Pugsley, J.A., Flinn, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a suspended sentence subject to terms,
that the sentence imposed was not fit, and that it was not in society's interest that the appellant should be removed form his present positive environment.
Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value.
It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time it was made.
Taking into account the factors before the sentencing judge, the sentence imposed could not be found to be clearly unreasonable.","[198, 192, 0, 1, 189, 191, 4, 2, 184, 10, 5, 183, 182, 188, 18, 193, 44, 197, 180, 179, 12]"

COUNSEL:               M. Dunphy and R. Niedermayer for the Applicant, Town
Blair Mitchell for the Respondent/Plaintiff
This application pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, is for an order setting aside the default judgment entered against the Town of Mahone Bay on February 7, 1996.
As a result of filing the default judgment, the application to assess damages has been set down for a hearing in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia on October 26, 1996.
The failure to file the notice of intention to proceed in these circumstances cannot be saved by Civil Procedure Rule. 2.01.
The plaintiff should have taken the matter to court to seek default judgment.
Even if I am wrong on that issue, I find the position of the defendant meets the test for the court to strike the default judgment under the provisions of Civil Procedure Rule 12.06.
The application is granted.
The defendant Town shall have 10 days in which to file its defence.
The plaintiff is entitled to her ""throw away"" costs of obtaining the default judgment.","This was an application by the defendants to set aside a default judgment entered against them by the plaintiff.
Although a statement of claim was served on the defendant, it's insurer was advised by the plaintiff's counsel that she would not proceed to judgment except on 10 days written notice.
More than six months later plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to the defendant's insurer giving 10 days notice.
This letter was not seen by him although he was in the process of putting together material for a solicitor to file a defence.
The defendant had always advised the plaintiff that it intended to defend.
No Notice of Intention, required for default judgment if six or more months had elapsed since the last step in the proceeding, was ever given to the defendant before the filing of the default judgment.
Allowing the application and setting aside the default judgment,
that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse on the part of the defendant for not filing the defence.
Sending a letter to the insurer does not satisfy the requirement of filing a Notice of Intention to proceed.
The fact that the prothonotary did not object to the request for default judgment without the Notice is immaterial.","[7, 200, 199, 8, 6, 10, 198, 195, 9, 11, 12, 197, 194]"

The Facts
And you'll be asked to put down conduct of Healthvision and that's the kind of conduct we're looking at, okay.
It argued that the jury erred in law in finding that the conduct of the appellant caused mental distress to the respondent, and that the jury's assessment of damages for mental distress was inordinately and disproportionately high.
None of the actions of the defendant would give rise to an independent action and any loss is properly compensated by the damages awarded for failure to give notice.
Furthermore, there was no circumstances in this case which would have rendered mental suffering foreseeable at the time the employment contract was made.
There were no such publicized allegations made by the appellant against Ms. Killorn.
If an award of damages for mental distress was lawful, the facts do not disclose conduct by the appellant that would justify a jury award in excess of $15,000, as gauged by awards made in other cases.

NOVA SCOTIA COURT OF APPEAL
JUDGMENT BY:","The respondent was hired as an account manager by the appellant.
She did not reach her planned sales goals during her employment, and became depressed.
She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor.
When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job.
She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed.
The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress.
The appellant appealed the award for mental distress.
Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal,
that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice.
Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment.
However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises.","[1026, 1019, 1006, 10, 1004, 1005, 1003, 992, 991, 256, 97, 13, 918, 101, 255, 11]"

No satisfactory proof was offered that suggested differently and I can only find that, in this regard, the plaintiff has failed to meet his burden of proof.
Even if I were wrong in finding no negligence on the part of the defendants, there is no satisfactory evidence that any of the plaintiff's damage resulted from the acts of the defendants.
At best the evidence might permit the argument that perhaps more tissue had to be removed because of the infection, but that, again, does not contribute much to a calculation of damages.
In conclusion, I find that the defendants and each of them did not fall below the standard of care required of them in their treatment of the plaintiff.
Further the plaintiff's loss is not attributable to any of the acts of the defendants but rather is the direct result of the injury he suffered.
The plaintiff's case, therefore, is dismissed with costs.
July 18, 1997 
Halifax, Nova Scotia","The plaintiff's leg was impaled for 25 minutes on an iron fence which he had attempted to climb for.
He was treated at the emergency department of the Victoria General Hospital for an hour.
He did not inform the doctors as to the length of time he had been impaled.
Upon his release he was advised to watch for any infection.
He was not issued antibiotics.
The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg.
He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence.
Dismissing the action,
that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way.
While the defendants underestimated the nature and extent of the injury, they provided a recognized method of treatment based upon the knowledge they had.
The real fault lies with the plaintiff who failed to reveal fully what had happened to him.","[5, 198, 199, 6, 7, 0, 11, 8, 9, 200, 197, 10, 201, 194, 192, 193]"
625,"The cases also establish that notice of changes in conditions of employment must be clear, that is, the employer must give actual notice to the employee of the proposed changes.
See Holland v. Midland Walwyn Capital Inc. (1993) 124 N.S.R.(2d) at page 212 where  Davison, J., said:
As stated in Wrongful Dismissal by Harris (1992 Ed.), at p. 3-53:
""It is, of course, an essential ingredient of constructive dismissal that the employee have actual, as opposed to constructive, knowledge of the unilateral change in job description.""
In my opinion, it is abundantly clear that the plaintiff was constructively dismissed by the defendant.
She had been an exemplary employee over a period of six years which the defendant acknowledged.
Considering all of the circumstances, I have concluded that an appropriate and proper period of notice is eight months.
The plaintiff, therefore, is entitled to damages calculated on the basis of eight months salary at the rate she was receiving at the time of her last actual employment with the defendant plus vacation pay at six percent per annum.
She is also entitled to prejudgment interest on that amount from July 14th, 1997.
I will hear counsel further as to the rate of prejudgment interest and costs of this proceeding.
Donald M. Hall, J.","This was an action for wrongful dismissal.
The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months.
During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff.
The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended.
She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause.
She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible.
The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice.
Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice,
that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice.
This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause.","[110, 193, 194, 191, 112, 192, 111, 113, 114, 190, 115]"

DECISION ON SENTENCING
(d)      an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and
(e)      all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.
Aggravating Factors:
Mitigating Factors:
Thirdly, it is clear from the circumstances of this case that Mr. Crowell has lost his career as a result of his involvement in these incidents, and that the sentencing process today is in fact an addition to the humiliation he and his family have endured.
Thus in sentencing you today Mr. Crowell, I am satisfied that by pleading guilty to these serious crimes you have been specifically deterred, and further rehabilitation should not be a major consideration for me.
After all you have brought humiliation and disgrace upon yourself.
You once held a position of prominence and respect in your community.
Your actions have now earned you the label of “thief”.
The able submissions made by your counsel before me can be made with equal vigour to the Correctional Services.
It is within their bailiwick to determine those two issues.
J. Michael MacDonald
Justice","The offender, a former police chief, plead guilty to five theft related charges.
The amount of money involved for all five counts was $64,000.
He used his position of authority as police chief to commit the crimes.
The offender did not have a criminal record.
The offences were premeditated, and directed against trusting and well-intentioned organizations.
Sentencing the offender to four months consecutive imprisonment on each count, for a total of twenty months, and ordering restitution to the victims,
 that the sentence must serve as a message of deterrence to all individuals who hold positions of trust and authority.
This message is particularly important to police officers, whose integrity must be beyond reproach.","[99, 75, 76, 98, 68, 77, 3, 97, 1, 74, 4, 36, 96, 78, 53, 35]"

THE COURT:                          The appeal is dismissed, per reasons for judgment of Freeman, J.A.; Pugsley and Cromwell, JJ.A., concurring.
His decision was upheld by Justice Stewart on an appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in Bankruptcy.
The appellant submits that the judge erred when she declined to address and reverse the Registrar's finding that 18 unsecured creditors of LaserWorks assigned their rights to the appellant.
On a proper appreciation of the evidence, it submits, no assignment took place.
The appellant did not take issue with the Registrar's finding that four of the 18 creditors received payment for them prior to the vote ....
The Registrar made no error in discerning this from the evidence and in exercising the court's discretionary jurisdiction to remedy substantial injustice.
The appellant's actions are not to be condoned.
I would dismiss the appeal with costs which I would fix costs at $3,000 plus disbursements to the Respondent and $3,000 plus disbursements to the Trustee.

I will first set out the issues which pertain to the application of CBCL to strike out the statement of claim of Granview and to stay or dismiss the proceedings.
Justice Cromwell then reviewed a good many cases and analyses the various tests considered in those cases and summarizes the authorities at page 24 as follows:
Although many of these authorities cite with approval the broad language of Henderson v. Henderson, supra, to the effect that any matter which the parties had the opportunity to raise will be barred, I think, however, that this language is somewhat too wide.
The better principle is that those issues which the parties had the opportunity to raise and, in all the circumstances, should have raised, will be barred.
Justice Cromwell then goes on to review many cases from a factual point of view to analyse how the stated principles are applied and again summarizes the test at pages 38 and 39 as follows:
I presume they may be able to be agreed upon if they are not too extensive.
I also award costs of $1,000.00 to CBCL on the second application, plus disbursements to be taxed if they cannot be agreed upon.
Halifax, Nova Scotia","The plaintiff was subcontracted by the City of Dartmouth to build a sports field.
The defendant were the project consultants for the City, and were involved throughout the tendering process and construction.
Their report indicated a number of significant potential problems.
The plaintiff was not made aware of the report when it bid on the project.
The plaintiff subsequently became aware of the problems, which made their work more costly.
After completing the work, it commenced a claim for the additional work which had to be performed due to the undisclosed site conditions.
The defendants were joined by the City as a third party to that action.
The plaintiff was successful at trial, but the decision was overturned on appeal.
The plaintiff then commenced the present action directly against the defendant, alleging negligent misrepresentation.
The defendant applied to strike the action on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process.

that the present cause of action is the same one litigated in the first action, simply under a different legal concept.
To allow the plaintiff to relitigate the same action on the same factual basis would be an abuse of process.","[5, 130, 0, 131, 177, 129, 176, 175, 133, 98]"

Isabelle LaMarche, for the Defence (Applicant)
The accused, Dany Kane, is charged with murder in the first degree.
He did not have the benefit of a preliminary inquiry as a result of the Crown preferring the indictment against him.
There is no evidence before the court on the merits of the case as the trial has yet to begin.
The accused brings this application for a stay of proceedings alleging that his rights under ss.11(d) and 11 (f) of Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms have been infringed due to the pre-trial publicity generated by this case.
The applicants position, in short, is that the pre-trial publicity has prejudiced his right to be tried by an impartial jury of his peers.
In my opinion the Applicant in the present case has not established on a balance of probabilities that his right to a fair trial by an impartial jury has been violated.
It may be that such an exercise will lead to the discovery that noimpartial jurors can be found, but until this exercise is attempted we are left with mere speculation as to the effect of the pre-trial publicity.
Accordingly the application for a stay of proceedings is dismissed.

Prior to jury selection, he applied for a stay of proceedings, alleging that there had been a breach of his right to a fair trial due to negative pre-trial publicity.

THE LAW - RECTIFICATION OF A CONTRACT
FINDINGS
I find that in this case that I am convinced that when Gene, Merle and Lorne Putnam sat down in 1987 to discuss how they would divide up the family operation they intended the following.
(1)               That each of them would end up essentially with the same value in assets.
(2)               That the dairy farm would continue to operate as it had for many years as a family operation and that therefore it would be valued on the basis of a going concern instead of simply the total of its individual parts.
Therefore, the plaintiffs would have been entitled to 84.2 percent of any sales made by the defendant of Total Production Quota.
I reject the suggestion by counsel for the defendant that the percentage should be as low as 35 percent because of a combining of quota figures in a number of provinces.
This issue is of no consequences in light of my decision in regard to rectification of the contract itself.","The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales.
The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales.
The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales.
Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification,
that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales.
The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","[4, 322, 0, 271, 321, 272, 273, 320, 5, 274, 16, 261]"

In Beaulac, supra, the Court concluded that a violation of Section 530 constitutes a substantial wrong which precludes the Appeal Court from dismissing the appeal pursuant to Section 686 of the Code:
Given the nature of language rights, the requirement of substantive equality, the purpose of s. 530, as described here, and the objective of s. 686, I believe that the violation of s. 530 constitutes a substantial wrong and not a procedural irregularity.
Accordingly, s. 686(1)(b) has no application in this case and a new trial must be ordered.
Clearly, there must be an effective remedy available for breach of s. 530 rights.
The application of the s. 686 proviso would make it illusory.”
In view of the foregoing, I would allow the appeal and order a new trial.

636,"LIABILITY
Legal Requirements
The legal principles applicable in the circumstances of this case are not really in dispute.
Clearly, these were commercial premises and the presence of any number of obstructions on the floor would be obvious to the plaintiff.
The defendant’s premises were described as a commercial warehouse from which building supplies were sold.
These circumstances were known to the plaintiff and as such he should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path as he proceeded towards the glass doors.
The plaintiff, therefore, did not use reasonable care for his own safety.
DAMAGES 
The plaintiff says the injuries he sustained to his knee resulted in his knee being swollen with infection, and that he had to endure considerable  pain and discomfort for a substantial period following the accident.
I have considered the evidence and authorities detailing calculations in respect of such a loss.
I am satisfied the sum of $1,000.00 is more than reasonable in the circumstances and such sum is thereby awarded.
Special Damages
The plaintiff claims, and is entitled to the sum of $ 578.00, on account of special damages relating to transportation to medical appointments, costs of photocopying medical reports, cost of prescription drugs not reimbursed, cost of increased cell phone use and preparation of accountant’s statements.","Plaintiff suffered soft tissue damage to knee when he tripped over a dolly cart in a building supply warehouse.
Knee became swollen and infected and he was off work for 12 days.
He claimed for pain and suffering, loss of income and loss of earning capacity.
Plaintiff was found 60% responsible for injuries and defendant 40% responsible.
Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks.
The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury.
However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door.
He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously.
The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path.
The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial.
There was no evidence to support a claim for diminishment of earning capacity.","[136, 137, 164, 134, 163, 165, 63, 133, 64, 65, 162, 132, 131]"

Although the accused's conduct in leaving the jurisdiction as he did may be considered to be blameworthy or, at best, reckless, if one accepts his version and deserving of some sanction, in the circumstances I have concluded that forfeiture should not be ordered against him.
As the authorities referred to above point out, the purpose of forfeiture is not to punish an obligor but to enforce payment of a financial obligation.
Those authorities also point out that the ability to pay a surety is a factor to be considered.
It seems to me that this principle should also apply to the principal obligor, the accused.
In my opinion, the accused already has enough on his plate and is experiencing enough negative factors without adding one more which would not be in his or the public’s interest.
Accordingly, the applications for forfeiture are dismissed.
Donald M. Hall, J.","The accused was charged with four offences relating to a twelve year old girl, including sexual assault and uttering a threat.
He was released on bail with a surety.
The accused is paraplegic.
He moved to British Columbia after his release.
He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest.
He was arrested and returned to stand trial.
The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited.
It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000.
It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000.
The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default.
Dismissing the applications for forfeiture,
that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities.
In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture.
With respect to the accused, he is impecunious.
His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment.
As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.","[0, 132, 131, 130, 133, 128, 129, 1, 2, 6, 126, 125, 3, 127]"

COURT NO: SH 55402
Leanne Wrathall, counsel for the Crown
AGREED STATEMENT OF FACTS
    MJD was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces.
    DB pleaded guilty and was convicted on March 27, 1995 of sexually assaulting MJD under s. 271 of the Canadian Criminal Code.
    MJD was voluntarily released from DND January 1996.
    MJD claims to suffer from depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to the sexual assault.
A review requires, apparently, new information, and therefore presumably an application for review without new information would be bound to fail.
The appeal period has now expired.
As such, absent new information, the plaintiff would have nowhere to go to seek relief or redress.
It is also inconceivable that having been denied the application for a pension the plaintiff is precluded from bringing this proceeding because she failed to appeal in time.
Assuming an individual accepts the Minister’s denial but believes for reasons unrelated to the pension application they are entitled to relief or remedy against the Crown , counsel’s position would require the plaintiff to pursue meaningless appeals simply to meet the conditions of s. 9 and s. 111.
Counsel for the plaintiff, in concluding his written submission, says:
I agree.","After being sexually assaulted, applicant was voluntarily released from Canadian Armed Forces.
She applied for and was denied a pension.
Civil proceedings were commenced and the Crown defended on the basis that before initiating civil proceedings, applicant was obliged to appeal denial of pension or seek review by Minister of pension rejection.
Applicant applied to strike out that portion of defence
application allowed.
The applicant applied for and was denied a pension.
Therefore no pension was at this time payable to her.
A review by the Minister would require new information and the appeal period had expired.
The applicant should not be denied her right to proceed against the Crown in such circumstances.","[0, 1, 135, 20, 133, 137, 21, 132, 22, 23, 134, 131, 18, 130, 24]"

In civil proceedings, Ms. Knox may be a competent and compellable witness for discovery.

Judge of the Provincial Court              ","The accused was charged with impaired driving causing bodily harm.
Expert evidence was given based on blood samples taken after the accident that the accused was impaired; this opinion was based on two assumptions, namely, that the accused had not consumed alcohol within half an hour of the accident, nor after the accident.
The Crown did not offer any evidence to prove these assumptions and, in fact, there was a three hour period prior to the accident where there was no evidence of what the accused, who did not testify, was doing.
Acquitting the accused,
that the expert evidence cannot be tendered by the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had been impaired.
The remainder of the evidence against the accused was insufficient to prove the accused's doubt beyond a reasonable doubt.","[7, 8, 299, 9, 11, 296, 10, 294, 295, 297, 298, 17, 15, 16, 292, 13]"

Respondent
                                                                           REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
THE COURT:            Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed per reasons for judgment of Cromwell, J.A.; Hallett and Oland, JJ.A. concurring.
[1]              The appellants pleaded guilty to fraud over $5000 and were sentenced by MacDougall, J.P.C.  They had received additional money on their pay cheques at Trenton Works for overtime they did not work and claimed that they were told by the paymaster not to worry about the irregularity and to give him one-half of the money.
This went on between 1996 - 1999.
Mr. MacPherson was overpaid in the amount of $19,156.00 and Mr. MacDonald in the amount of $32,866.00.
Each gave half of these amounts to the paymaster.
While the agreement reached between counsel was, of course, not binding on the judge, the joint recommendation made to him was a fit sentence.
In the circumstances, we see no sound reason for departing from it.
[5]              Leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is allowed and the restitution orders are amended by reducing the amounts ordered to be repaid by one-half.
Concurred in:","The appellants pled guilty to theft over $5,000.
The Crown and the defence put forward a joint sentencing recommendation of two years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud, which was all that the appellants had actually retained.
The sentencing judge ordered full restitution.
The appellants appealed; the Crown conceded that the appeal should be allowed.
Allowing the appeal,
that while the agreement reached by the Crown and the appellants was not binding upon the sentencing judge, the joint recommendation was a fit sentence; in the circumstances there was no sound reason for departing from it.","[1, 0, 37, 36, 15, 22, 2, 3, 20, 21, 14, 10, 23, 35, 34, 9, 24]"
641,"Finally, any challenge after the fact must be placed in the context of the detailed and comprehensive provisions relating to jury selection in the Criminal Code.
Since the test for apprehension of bias involves the conclusion of an informed person, I will now review the circumstances which are present in this matter as part of the process of determining if the appellant has met the onus described by Justice Cory in S.(R.D.).
We know very little about the statement of Juror No. 12 which is alleged to give rise to apprehension of bias; namely,
I don’t know why they would be having a trial over this, the woman was drunk and on the wrong side of the road.
except that it was made, and the Crown does not dispute that fact.
I have considered these grounds of appeal, and in my view, they do not, either individually or cumulatively, warrant intervention by this court with the jury’s verdict.
Further, with respect to the other grounds of appeal which I have dismissed in these reasons for judgment, since they do not, individually, involve errors of law, they cannot, cumulatively, warrant this court’s intervention.
In the result I would dismiss this appeal.
Concurred in:","The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol.
The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand.
She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges.
She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence.
Dismissing the appeal,
that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury.
Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial.
Finally, there were no errors by the judge on any of the other grounds advanced for appeal.","[525, 623, 625, 624, 514, 622, 527, 524, 526]"

HEARD BEFORE:         The Honourable Associate Chief Judge R. Brian Gibson
DATE HEARD:             December 3, 2001
PLACE HEARD: Dartmouth, Nova Scotia

COUNSEL:                   David Bright, for the Crown
Kent Clarke, for the Defence
[1]              Mr. Paul Henneberry has pled guilty to 12 counts of failing to comply with the provisions of subsection 153(1) of the Income Tax Act by failing to remit to the Receiver General of Canada, money deducted and withheld from salaries, wages or other remuneration paid to the employees of Halifax Regional Protection Services Limited (herein referred to H.R.P.S.).
I note that the Information charging Mr. Henneberry with these 12 offences, lists his birth date as March 3, 1962.
If that date of birth is correct, the accused would be 40 years of age and I would infer in light of any evidence to the contrary that his future prospects for employment and to earn income are likely quite good.
I believe that I require something more than a submission that Mr. Henneberry’s current employment prospects are not good as the sole basis upon which to exercise my discretion to not grant the order sought by the Crown under subsection 238(2).
That date was the due date set for the payment of the fines.
I am prepared to hear counsel, upon application, prior to that date to extend 
the due date of the foregoing payment.

Mr. Alan Nicholson, for the Defendant
THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK
The Supreme Court[3] makes clear that consent plays no part in s. 254.
As the law is presently written the Crown need not prove an accused’s “consent” to properly take blood samples.
The test, rather, is “compliance” which is equated roughly to a failure to object.
It seems obvious that if his thinking was clear enough to appreciated the 10(b) advice it would be sufficient to comprehend the 10(a) aspect.
Considering, therefore, the duties of the police under s. 10(b) I proceed from the summary contained in R. v. Bartle[4].
I extract the following portion of the judgement of Lamer, C.J.C. beginning at paragraph 17.

After being involved in an accident, the accused was taken to hospital where a blood demand was given and eventually acceded to.
The accused challenged the validity of the blood demand and argued that his right to counsel was violated.
Accused guilty of operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit; there was no violation of the accused's right to counsel.
The officer had valid grounds to make the demand, having been advised that the accused was in an accident, that someone had said the accused was either high or intoxicated, having smelled a mild odour of alcohol on the accused and the accused having advised him that he only had three beer.
Even if the accused's claim to amnesia for all the events around that time was believed, there was no medical evidence to suggest that he could not understand what the officer said to him at the hospital.
Although his degree of alertness may have fluctuated, he displayed an understanding of the situation by showing appropriate concern for how much he had been drinking and asking questions which showed an understanding of his situation and what speaking to counsel would entail.","[9, 0, 101, 269, 102, 268, 104, 266, 267, 265, 103, 106, 108, 107, 263, 109, 262, 260, 261, 259]"

The answer which the Constable gave was really not responsive to the question posed to him, but is certainly an indication of what he had thought about the ability of the accused to drive the motor vehicle.
He had apparently concluded that in the event he passed the screening device he was quite capable of continuing to drive.
In order to address the question which I have posed above I had to ask myself what direction I would give to a jury (or to myself) if I were the trier of facts in a case on the totality of this evidence.
My conclusion is that I would have little doubt that with the necessary proper instruction a jury (or I) would have little or no choice but to acquit the appellant.
In reaching this conclusion I have reviewed and to a certain extent reweighed the evidence before the trial judge, as is my authority and duty.
I have concluded that the evidence was weak to the point where there was virtually no choice but to acquit, and accordingly the appeal is allowed and the conviction quashed.","The police observed the appellant's vehicle rub another vehicle and followed him to where he parked without difficulty.
While taking the appellant to where the incident occurred, the officer noted slight smell of alcohol and bloodshot eyes.
The appellant failed the ALERT test and refused the breathalyzer.
The refusal charge was dismissed and the appellant was convicted of impaired driving.
The appellant appealed.
Appeal allowed; conviction quashed.
The evidence of impairment was too weak to convict the appellant.
The officer told the accused that if he passed the ALERT test, he would be sent on his way.
Thus, she must not have thought that the appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired.
Failure to act cannot be considered by the trial judge as part of the reasonable and probable grounds.","[75, 0, 74, 1, 73, 72, 2, 3, 4, 70, 71]"

There was therefore evidence on which the Justice of the Peace could conclude that this was a continuing activity and that it was on-going at the date of the warrant application.
Finally the police did not seek a warrant on the basis of this information alone, but conducted surveillance, which corroborated the information provided by their sources.
To suggest that the traffic could have been going to the other basement apartment is to propose a level of coincidence that is highly improbable in the light of the information provided by the four sources.
Conclusion 
I find that there was sufficient reliable evidence to constitute the reasonable and probable grounds for issuance of this warrant.
In doing so, I note that the standard of proof for issuance of a warrant is reasonable and probable grounds, which must be more than mere suspicion, but is considerably less than proof beyond reasonable doubt or even proof on balance of probabilities.
Having found that the warrant was properly issued and that the search therefore met the standard in Charter s. 8, I need not consider s. 24(2).","The defendant applied to have evidence found during a search of his premises excluded on the basis that the search warrant was invalid.
Application dismissed;
there was sufficient evidence to constitute reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant.
Overall the nature of the evidence was compelling with four separate and independent sources all confirming either that the defendant was selling drugs or that drugs were being sold at his residence; although individually none of the sources was of known or proven reliability, collectively they reinforced and confirmed each other; and the police conducted surveillance which corroborated the information provided by the sources.","[103, 1, 0, 101, 102, 2, 100, 99, 98, 3, 4, 5, 96]"

By the Court:
[1]               This is an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  
ANALYSIS
The length of the delay
The information before this court was sworn September 29th, 2002 and Mr. Abbass’s trial was scheduled for December 18th,  2003.
The total time period between charge and trial is a little better than 14 ½ months.
The accused at no time waived his right to a trial within a reasonable time.
On the whole of the evidence, I am satisfied that the applicant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that his right to be tried within a reasonable time has been infringed.
Institutional delay of 13 months in the context of this particular offender charged with these particular offences gives rise to an inferred prejudice, and renders his trial unfair in that he is not able to be tried within a reasonable time.
The prejudice is such that it can not be remedied in any other way than by entering a stay of proceedings.
Accordingly, the proceedings are stayed.
Pamela S. Williams
Judge of the Provincial Court","The defendant applied for a stay of proceedings on the basis of a violation of his right to be tried in a reasonable time.
There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial.
Stay of proceedings granted.
At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts.
Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","[0, 122, 65, 66, 121, 120, 119, 68, 67, 69, 10, 118, 1, 11, 117]"

...we should also remind ourselves that evidence of a complaint of sexual assault is never evidence of the facts complained of as the complaint cannot support the complainant’s testimony.
From this proposition I think that the best that the prosecution can expect is that I accept the complainant’s prior statement only as part of her narrative and nothing more.
I concluded that the complainant had testimonial competence.
Conclusion
On the evidence before me and that which I accept, I determine that it would be unsafe to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused sexually assaulted the complainant or touched her for a sexual purpose, or at all.
In my view, the evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and I was not persuaded, on the total evidence and that which I accept, that the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt, on the Information tried before me, that the accused, P.J.N. between the 19th day of October 2001 and the 19th day of November 2001, sexually assaulted S.D.M. or for a sexual purpose touched her with his hand.
Accordingly, I find him not guilty as charged and will enter acquittals on the record.","A 14 year old accused her friend's father of touching her breast while she was sleeping over at his residence with her friend.

the complainant's testimony was internally inconsistent and her cross-examination revealed obvious errors which were never corrected to rehabilitate her credit.

[9]              In my opinion, the judge’s decision was procedurally unfair to Ms. Terry and wrong in principle.
He erred in hearing Mr. Francis’ application to reduce the amount of child maintenance and to cancel arrears absent full disclosure by Mr. Francis.
As Goodfellow, J. put it in MacLean v. MacLean (2002), 2002 NSSC 5 (CanLII), 200 N.S.R. (2d) 34 at para 19, “Full disclosure in family matters is a given.
Failure of a party to [disclose] will, in most circumstances, result in adverse consequences.”
In my respectful view, only in rare circumstances should a party applying to reduce a child support obligation be heard absent that party making full disclosure.
Moreover, the absence of disclosure here was unfair to Ms. Terry as it prevented her from making a full response to Mr. Francis’ application.
I would set aside the order of MacDonald, J.S.C.(Fam.Div.) and dismiss Mr. Francis’ application without prejudice to his bringing a new variation application on proper material.
[11]         Ms. Terry did not request costs and I would therefore order none.
Concurred in:","The father, who was in arrears under an order requiring him to pay child support, applied to vary the support order which had been made less than a year before.
He failed to make the required financial disclosure and relied on a medical disability of which he gave no prior notice.

The mother appealed.
Appeal allowed;
the judge's decision to allow the application to proceed was procedurally unfair to the appellant and wrong in principle.
Only in rare circumstances should a party applying to reduce child support be heard absent that party making full disclosure.","[0, 48, 1, 47, 2, 46, 45, 3, 44, 43, 4, 5, 6, 41, 7, 42, 40]"

They make clear that the accused=s evidence was considered not only in light of the question of credibility but also of the ultimate issue of reasonable doubt.
The reasons read in conjunction with the brief record make clear the pathway through the evidence and law which the judge took to arrive at his conclusion.
As demonstrated by the discussion of the preceding submissions of the appellant, the reasons do not preclude meaningful appellate review of whether the judge properly applied the burden of proof to the evidence as a whole.

Appeal dismissed;
the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review.
The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt.
It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.","[0, 13, 14, 238, 239, 15, 235, 16, 237, 234, 236, 17]"

D. Roper Services Limited
Appellant
Thompson, in his report, notes if the equipment had been depreciated over the term of the contract, the additional depreciation would have eliminated the suggested loss on disposal.
There was no satisfactory evidence the liquidation of the equipment purchased by Roper Ltd., as a result of the termination of the contract, resulted in any loss that is otherwise claimable against Devco.
In the circumstance, I am satisfied there was no loss from any forced liquidation arising from the termination of the contract.
Roper has not shown that the trial judge made any reviewable error in reaching these conclusions.
In view of the conclusions I have reached, it is not necessary to consider whether Devco was entitled to rely on its early termination clause to limit losses by Roper.
Other issues:
In light of Devco’s concession that if the trial judge’s assessment of damages is upheld, the issues raised by way of cross-appeal would have no practical effect on the outcome, it is not necessary to address those issues.
I would dismiss the appeal with costs fixed at $5,000.00 plus disbursements.
I would dismiss the cross-appeal without costs.
Concurred in:","The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant.
In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment.
The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals.
The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid.
The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000.
Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents.
The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages.
Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained.
Both parties appealed.
Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed;
the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract.
The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation.
Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","[1, 2, 338, 333, 0, 331, 336, 337, 332, 5, 330, 4, 334, 3, 335, 329]"

March 28, 2006
Halifax, Nova Scotia","The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce.
The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support.
Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education.
After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments.
The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home.
Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work.
The father now applied to terminate spousal support.
The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses.
Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","[366, 365, 0, 2, 364, 1, 367, 4, 6, 3, 5, 354, 363, 362, 360, 11, 8, 361, 357, 10, 9, 359, 7, 356]"

[19]         Section 601(4) lists the factors that should be taken into consideration on an amendment application, which include whether the accused has been misled or prejudiced and whether the amendment would cause an injustice.
Here there was no suggestion that the amendment of the date would mislead or cause prejudice or injustice to the accused.
There was no indication that the date of the offences was relevant to the defence.
In summary, the trial judge erred by granting the motion for directed verdict based on the discrepancy between the date of the offences alleged in the Information and the evidence presented at trial because the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences.
Alternatively, if the motion was granted on the basis of insufficiency of the evidence, the reasons are inadequate.
Furthermore, although it was not necessary to amend the Information because the date was not an essential element, if the reason for the directed verdict was that it was too late to amend, that was also a reversible error of law.
The appeal is accordingly allowed, the acquittals are set aside and a new trial is ordered.

[7]              The trial judge found that she did not believe the appellant’s evidence and that it did not give rise to a reasonable doubt.
She said: 
The Crown concedes that the trial judge may have overstated the case in this respect.
The appellant’s evidence, in relevant part, was as follows:
You were convicted on the 8th of May, 1972 of break and enter, again one count and you received a suspended sentence of two years, correct?
You were convicted in 1973 of three counts of break and enter, one count of theft, er, two counts of theft under for which you received a total of six months, is that correct?
Q.  And in 1974 you were convicted of break and enter and you given 18 months for that, correct?  18 months custody?
The misapprehension is, therefore, one that gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.
I would set aside the conviction and order a new trial.
Concurred in:","The appellant was convicted of sexual assault.
The court disbelieved his evidence, principally because it was found to be internally inconsistent.
The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food.
There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly.
The appellant appealed.
Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered.
The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic.
The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment.
The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","[248, 13, 0, 274, 273, 249, 14, 40, 195, 250, 39, 272, 12, 1, 194]"

From that one should deduct a credit of two years at 25 percent for the fact of Mr. Pinch pleading guilty.
To my mind a further reduction of one and one-half years would be justified.
Counsel have suggested that the court should simply impose the penalty globally rather than trying to separate and determine an appropriate sentence with respect to each count.
I am satisfied that, in the circumstances, that is appropriate here because certainly the principle of totality would apply.
As I have indicated, I have concluded ,therefore, that the appropriate sentence in this case, having regard to all of the factors that I have mentioned, is  that the accused serve a term of four years and six months in a federal institution.
That sentence, without giving the credits as I have for the time already served, would be very close to the sentence proposed by Mr. Parker for the Crown.
At the same time I have taken into account the factors emphasized by Mr. Stewart.

I have considered what this Court has awarded by way of costs in previous cases and have reviewed the case law that has been presented by counsel.
I have taken into account also the considerable financial disclosure that the two applications required of the Respondent and the length of each Court appearance and the average complexity of the issues that were before the Court.
I therefore order the Applicant pay to the Respondent costs, inclusive of disbursements, in the sum of $6,500.00.","Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement.
Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support.
The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years.
She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000.
The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent.
Application dismissed;
the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed.
Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","[22, 0, 332, 331, 273, 272, 274, 1, 329, 21, 271, 46, 270]"

    I do not believe Mr. Colley’s evidence that he acted in self-defence.
Nevertheless, I do not believe that Mr. Colley intended for Mr. Simmons to suffer such serious injuries.
The blow to the arm, although not carefully measured, was intended to disarm Mr. Simmons, not to cause the fracture.
Similarly, I do not believe Mr. Colley intended Mr. Simmons to suffer cracked ribs.
Mr. Colley acted from anger and acted in a manner to have his will prevail over that of Mr. Simmons relative to access to the Simmons property.
He appears to regret that Mr. Simmons suffered such injuries and is sorry that that was the outcome.
In conclusion, I find Mr. Colley guilty of all three charges.
However, based upon the principles expressed in the R. v. Kienapple (1974) 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 524 decision, a conviction should enter upon only the S.268 aggravated assault.

The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence.

The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support.
The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment.
The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed.
Both parties applied to vary child support.
The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school.
Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses.
The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies.
The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months.
Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years.
The father will pay 25 per cent of the core university costs which are not covered by the plan for the middle child as well as the difference in the Table amount of support for two children versus one child; the father shall pay the Table amount of support for one child to the wife for the youngest child as well as that child's expenses for private school; the wife will be responsible for any extra-curricular activities or tutoring outside the private school; the youngest child will be entitled to the same post-secondary benefits in the same fashion as the two older children; the CRJ is amended to provide that the two oldest children are in the joint care of their parents and will not include any other reference to custody or access; the husband is entitled to specified block access with the youngest child; if flight arrangements are made for this child and she does not fly (and there is no medical reason confirmed in writing by a doctor for that failure), the husband's block access shall be expanded for one week at the next access period and the cost of any penalty from the missed flight will be deducted dollar for dollar from the child support payable by the husband.","[1, 614, 618, 612, 0, 3, 4, 2, 613, 6, 617, 11, 610, 5, 8, 10, 14, 604, 7]"

did while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol have care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to section 253(a) of the Criminal Code;
And furthermore did having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams in one hundred milliliters of blood have the care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to section 253(b) of the Criminal Code.
Facts
[2]              The relevant facts are as set out in the Crown brief:
O.J. No. 197, 2004 CarswellOnt 315 (Ont. C.A.).
From the cases cited, I conclude that the risk assessment, as an element of care and control, should include an assessment of the risk of the accused changing his mind; in other words, it is a relevant, although not necessarily a sufficient, consideration.
In reaching this conclusion I note that in Lockerby, the defendant was in the passenger seat and crossed to the driver’s seat of an idling vehicle to engage the emergency brake and turn off the engine.
Conclusion
The Crown having failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was in care or control of his motor vehicle at the time in question, I find that the defendant is not guilty of either offence charged.","The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit.
The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in.
The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house.
Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged.
From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a).
Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","[0, 10, 84, 11, 12, 13, 83, 80, 16, 15, 78, 14, 79]"

The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed.
The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence.
His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use.
An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana.
The unrepresented mother sought costs.
Conditions continued; variation granted.
If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation.
Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800.
In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children.
The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips.
While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother.
If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home.
In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party.
Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work.
She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","[12, 199, 293, 200, 0, 292, 290, 289, 291, 202, 201, 288, 204, 198]"

INTRODUCTION
Crown and defence have agreed that the evidence heard on the voir dire is to form part of the trial proper.
In  the  event  there  was  a  breach  of R. C.’s section 8 rights to be free from unreasonable search and seizure this is not a case in which the evidence should be excluded.
Fairness of the trial
The evidence sought to be excluded is 17.8 grams of crack cocaine.
Seriousness of the breach
In considering the seriousness of the breach, once again we apply the framework established by the Supreme Court of Canada in Collins, supra:
Was the breach committed in good faith or by inadvertence, was it  was  technical in nature or was it was deliberate, wilful or flagrant?;
Was the breach motivated by the urgency of the situation or by the necessity to prevent the loss or destruction of evidence?;
were followed except for detailed written records being kept.
But again, as indicated above, I find that nothing of consequence turns on this as the search was minimally intrusive, even by R. C.’s account.
CONCLUSION
To exclude the evidence, in my view,  would call  into question  the  very reputation  of  the administration of justice.
Pamela S. Williams
Judge of Youth Justice Court","A youth was arrested and charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle after the vehicle arrived near the location of a pre-arranged drug transaction.
The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear.
A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized.
The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive.
There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search.
This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person.","[0, 12, 242, 232, 211, 16, 11, 1, 231, 13, 230, 233, 205, 212, 241, 210, 204, 213, 196]"

NOVA SCOTIA COURT OF APPEAL
Citation: Cape Breton (Regional Municipality) v. 
[2]              For reasons that I will develop, I would dismiss this appeal.
Simply put, the CBRM's claim is not sustainable because it is premised on a purported constitutional obligation which, in this context, does not exist.
A.        Overview
The federal and provincial governments and legislatures have constitutionally committed pursuant to s. 36 of the Constitution Act, 1982 to provide Canadians with comparable levels of public services for comparable levels of taxation wherever in Canada they reside.
If Justice Murphy’s decision is upheld, the government and legislature of Nova Scotia (collectively, the “Province” or “Nova Scotia”) will be immune from judicial review of this legal, constitutional commitment.
Therefore, this proposed interpretation respectfully offers no chance of success.
The Chambers judge committed no error of law because it remains ""plain and obvious"" that these pleadings disclose no reasonable cause of action.
Respectfully they are ""certain to fail"" and ""absolutely unsustainable"".
DISPOSITION
Concurred in:","The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972).
At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities.
Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect.
The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36.
The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed.
Appeal dismissed.
The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim.
The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application).
Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck.
While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities.
Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced.
On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","[0, 30, 610, 29, 1, 607, 31, 2, 28, 606, 557, 605, 57, 32, 604, 56, 27, 3, 558, 559]"

Judge:                           The Honourable Judge Marc C. Chisholm
Heard:                           March 18, 2009, in Halifax, Nova Scotia
Charge:                          (1) s.5(2) CDSA, possession of cannabis (marihuana) for the purpose of trafficking
(2) s.5(2) CDSA, possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking

(4) s.90 CC, carrying a concealed weapon
(5) 733.1(1)(a) CC, breach of Probation
Counsel:                        Shaun O’Leary, Federal Crown
The violation of the accused’s section 10(b) right upon detention was brief and no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach; therefore, no exclusion of evidence will result.
(a) the seriousness of the charges facing the accused;
(b) there being no bad faith on the part of the police;
(c) the evidence not being conscriptive; and
(d) the fact that the accused could have been lawfully arrested for admittedly having violating the condition to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.
The motion to exclude the accused’s statement to the police is denied.
The motion to exclude the results of the search of the accused’s person is denied.
Dated at Halifax, Nova Scotia, this ____ day of _____________ 2009.
Judge Marc C.  Chisholm","The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation.
Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana.
When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse.
He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him.
After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment.
The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.
He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs.
Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon.
The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search.
He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights.
Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied.
The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached.
While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary.
Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning.
After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case.
Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable.
The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana.
The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge.
Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful.
The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable.
In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","[270, 6, 268, 267, 7, 11, 10, 9, 8, 266, 269, 263, 12, 0, 264, 13, 265, 14, 15, 259]"

He testified:
OKO:      Did you ever speak with Mr. Buckley directly about what had been sent to Mr. Van Bommel?
A.        Yes, I did.
On appeal the respondent did not address any of the instances of prejudicial or hearsay evidence that came in through this witness.
No mention of it is found in the judge’s reasons and hence no indication that the appellant was prejudiced by the admission of this evidence.
I find there was no error in terms of the Crown failing to lead evidence to substantiate the suggestions it made in cross-examination of the appellant.
The trial judge made findings of credibility against the appellant.
The evidence wrongly admitted put the appellant in a bad light.
The Crown has not satisfied me that the verdict would necessarily have been the same.
The normal remedy under s. 686(2) for such errors would be to quash the conviction and order a new trial.
Instead I quash the conviction and enter an acquittal.
I do so as a result of  my conclusion that the trial judge misapprehended significant evidence which led to an unreasonable verdict.
In light of my conclusion I need not consider the sentence appeal.","An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment.
The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.'
Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student.
The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them.
He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor.
Appeal allowed; conviction quashed.
The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility.
The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","[115, 665, 1, 664, 659, 282, 276, 0, 661, 663, 662, 277, 285, 658, 656]"

Written Decision:  July 30, 2009
The sentence imposed today should reflect society’s abhorrence of those who decide to live by the gun and use the gun to settle disputes.
Given the nature and circumstances of the offence and the character of this offender a proper sentence should be at the high end of the mid-range set out by Blacklock J. in R. v. T.H.
Accordingly, a sentence of 9 ½ years should be imposed with a credit on a 2 for 1 basis for Mr. Johnston’s pre-trial custody.
In this case the accused served approximately 17 months of pre-trial custody while on remand and he should be credited 34 months for this dead time.
Accordingly the global sentence to be imposed is one of 6 years, 8 months incarceration.
There will also be an order under s.109 prohibiting Mr. Johnston from possessing any firearm, crossbow, restricted weapon, ammunition and explosives.
That prohibition order will be for life, and there will be a DNA order.
The Crown is to prepare those orders.","The defendant was found guilty of attempted murder after he used a handgun to shoot the complainant outside a bar.

Second Issue:   The period of retroactive support for the younger child, para.
The Law, para.
She must be held responsible for the many months of delay in responding to Mr. Munro’s inquiries.
The effect of her failure is to nullify the effective notice of July 8 & 20, 2004 and in subsequent correspondence.
It would be a very unfair result, if he could now be told that he is guilty of blameworthy conduct and his child support obligation reassessed for a period more than three years prior to May 30, 2008.
Counsel will have the opportunity to make further submissions on this point.
Conclusion
Child support and Section 7 expenses for the younger son will be therefore calculated based on the child support tables for the retroactive period of three years before May 30, 2008.
That reassessment may result in a finding that the obligation has in fact been satisfied.
In addition, s.7 expenses will be calculated on a proportionate basis.","The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children.
The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed.
The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed.
His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend.
He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend.
He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain.
The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it.
He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed).
The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier.
She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part).
The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars.
Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application.
The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed.
He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed.
He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend.
While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation.
Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received).
The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years.
While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter.
The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations.
Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","[417, 1, 0, 413, 4, 2, 3, 414, 7, 8, 408, 5, 416, 15, 12, 13, 6, 410, 10, 17, 418, 405]"

By the Court:
[1]              This is a divorce proceeding between Jodie Colleen Callahan and Allan Wilfred Delorey.
Tristen had a relationship with both Mr. Hanna’s and Mr. Delorey’s extended family at the time of separation.
[22]         Did Mr. Delorey stand ""in the place of a parent"" at the time of the parties separation?
[23]         Mr. Delorey's time in a parenting role with Tristen was relatively lengthy ‑ from Tristen's point of view.
That parenting role was diminished before and during the marriage by Ms. Callahan's decision to allow Mr. Hanna back into Tristen's life.
Mr. Hanna re‑established his contact with Tristen before and during the marriage.
Mr. Hanna’s involvement with Tristen increased during the Delorey-Callahan marriage.
I conclude that Mr. Delorey was generous and concerned in his support and caring for and of Tristen ‑ but that he did so at the time of his separation from Ms. Callahan, as a person in addition to, not in the place of, a parent.
I conclude that Tristen is not a child of the marriage of Ms. Callahan and Mr. Delorey.
I conclude that this is not an appropriate case for an award of costs.
Halifax, Nova Scotia","The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.'
While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year.
The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child.
She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship.
The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife.
The child no longer had contact with the husband.
The child is not a 'child of the marriage.'
The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him.
He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child.
The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on).
Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent.
Such is not the case here.","[18, 19, 185, 20, 21, 184, 183, 22, 23, 24, 25, 179, 178, 26, 6, 27, 28, 176, 175, 29, 177, 174, 182]"

The Crown suggests that the Charter breach does not reach the threshold of exclusion, pointing out that the police officers did not, at any rate, act in bad faith.
I considered whether admission of this statement notwithstanding the s.10(b) violation would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
I have reflected on the seriousness of the state's breach, the impact of the breach on the Charter protected rights and interests of the accused and society's interest in adjudicating the merits of the case.
I find that the administration of justice would indeed be held in disrepute in these circumstances.
This is a different situation than those cases involving guns and narcotics.
This is an absolute fundamental right to get advice from counsel before making a statement to the police.
Access to counsel is the gateway of Charter rights particularly in these circumstances where this statement is the only evidence to be offered by the Crown in seeking a conviction.
It would be egregious to allow admission of the videotaped statement into evidence.
Justice M. Heather Robertson","The accused was charged with aggravated assault, use of a weapon, unlawful possession of a weapon and breach of a recognizance.
The admissibility of the accused's videotaped statement was at issue with regard to his capacity to understand the Charter caution given by the police.
When asked if he wished to contact a lawyer, the accused had responded in the negative, noting that there would 'probably be one down around there anyway.'
statement excluded from evidence; the accused's s. 10(b) rights had been violated.
It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel.
His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that the officer should have made an effort to clarify the informational component of the right to counsel.","[124, 125, 0, 122, 1, 123, 2, 121, 120, 3, 6, 4, 5, 118, 117, 7, 116]"

The suggestion was also made by the Plaintiff that the Defendant did not have a reasonable knowledge of the applicable or relevant law concerning the admissibility of the evidence in question.
I have reviewed the transcript of the criminal trial as well as the viva voce evidence of the Defendant and I am satisfied, and I find, that the Defendant had a reasonable knowledge of the applicable law relating to these issues.
He erred, however, in the application of that law to the facts of this case.
That is something that can occur in any trial.

Associate Chief Justice","The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people.
He was charged with dangerous driving.
His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial.
At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment.
The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory.
As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination.
The plaintiff was convicted.
He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won.
Eventually, the charges were dropped.
The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal.
In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence.
They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury.
The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract.
The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions.
Action dismissed.
The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer.
Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result.
Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case.
The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions.
While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","[306, 1, 301, 303, 0, 299, 297, 300, 4, 295, 298, 6, 7, 296]"

By the Court:
The preliminary inquiry rights were waived at an early stage when disclosure was to her knowledge by no means complete.
Moreover, there is no suggestion that Crown disclosure is incomplete.
Accordingly, I would not order that Ms. Calder now be entitled to a preliminary inquiry.
There has been a mistrial.
Ms. Calder is relieved from her previous agreements and undertakings with the Crown regarding trial process.
She is entitled to re-elect.
Addendum
At the conclusion of the decision, Ms. Calder moved for a continuation of the publication ban on the “newly discovered evidence” mentioned in court yesterday and in the decision today.
The ban is continued and will also apply to paragraph [5] of this decision.","The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence.
Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention.
The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure.
Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial.
The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage.
However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","[5, 171, 0, 31, 32, 33, 34, 170, 167, 169, 36, 168, 165, 38, 35, 166, 164, 39, 37, 40, 161]"

Oland, JA states at paras.

Charles MacIntosh, Nova Scotia Real Property Practice Manual, at 7‑21 described that doctrine as follows:
This permission extended by Borden to Eldred and then to Roy precludes the creation of any right to cross ""the Borden driveway"" created by prescription or lost modern grant.
I find further that the use of the garden on Borden's property by Eldred and then Roy was with the permission of Borden Longard, as Borden sets out in his Statutory Declaration.  
Similarly, as a result, no right has vested in the Plaintiff, Roy Longard, as to the use of this garden.
If necessary, I will receive written submissions as to costs.","After a piece of family property was divided into two parcels, one of the brothers continued to use a driveway and maintain a garden on the other parcel.
When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times.
When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription.
He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission.
Judgment for the defendants;
there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway.
Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission.","[0, 61, 62, 181, 32, 65, 64, 179, 180, 183, 31, 1, 66]"

Applicant
Respondent
Judge:                  The Honourable Justice Peter M. S. Bryson
With respect, Mr. MacDonald’s actions on the night in question bear no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use in HRM.
Without in any way diminishing the seriousness of the convictions here, Mr. MacDonald did not display, brandish, threaten or assault anyone (with or without a weapon), in any manner whatsoever.
There is nothing in the circumstances of the offender or the offences which suggest that the public would be unsafe if Mr. MacDonald is released.
18, per McEachern, C.J.).
    I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that detention of Mr. MacDonald pending appeal is not necessary in the public interest.
DISPOSITION
Notwithstanding the foregoing findings, I agree with the Crown that Mr. MacDonald’s proposed terms of release are inadequate.
(n)        That his release be conditional upon the appeal proceeding on the date scheduled for the hearing, and if the date is to be changed for any reason, this order for release shall be reviewed in chambers on a date fixed by the court.
    I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that Mr. MacDonald has established that he will comply with the foregoing terms of release.","The defendant, who was found guilty of the careless use of a firearm, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace and possession of a restricted or prohibited firearm applied for bail pending appeal.
He had been found, in his residence, with a firearm licensed in Alberta but not licensed to be brought into this province or possessed here.
The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work.
Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction.
Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions.
The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","[188, 169, 0, 166, 1, 168, 2, 170, 3, 5, 163, 4, 8, 171, 187, 7, 161]"

The voir dire decision did not find it necessary to discuss s. 24(2).
As a result, we have little guidance from the trial judge on the s. 24(2) analysis.
In my view, this is not a case where it is appropriate for the Court of Appeal, at first instance, to engage in the delicate balance of a s. 24(2) analysis.
Disposition
To dispose of the appeal, it is unnecessary to discuss the second and fourth issues mentioned earlier.
I would grant leave to appeal, and allow the appeal.
I would set aside the conviction.

In ¶ 9, line one, replace “Cst.” with “Cpl”. ","The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused.
Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police.
They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside.
Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home.
The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home.
From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom.
They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants.
During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found.
The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants.
Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant.
Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners.
The defendant appealed.
Appeal allowed; conviction set aside;
although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis.
Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant.
Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","[353, 367, 1, 0, 354, 366, 44, 2, 352, 355, 365, 45, 46, 350, 49, 349, 348, 351, 47, 43, 48, 344, 3, 345, 52, 347, 50, 51, 346]"

What should PWC do with the monies received from the debtor after the default?
It seems to me that the debtor did send those monies to PWC with the intention those monies be distributed  to the debtor’s creditors.
To that extent the trustee acts as the debtor’s agent.
PWC as agent has an obligation to disburse those monies to the creditors as was the intention of the debtor.
In summary, the fee of PWC should only be based on monies received from the debtor while the proposal was extant.
The fee is taxed and allowed in the appropriate amount, with leave to reapply to me to set a specific number if PWC and he Superintendent cannot agree what that should be.
I also opine that the excess monies should be distributed to the creditor’s, who should be advised that their original debts remain receivable.

[5]              In our view, the judge erred in law in so holding.
ITI retained a discretion under its contract with its students as to what course materials it would supply.
The fact that it intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide those particular materials.
It follows that, as of the date of the supplier’s demand, these books were not “subject to any agreement for sale” within the meaning of s. 81.1(1)(c)(v) and that the judge erred in finding otherwise.

A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed.

Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time.
The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand.

In these proceedings both claim title to or ownership of a certain portion of meadowland abutting the Margaree River and containing approximately six acres.

From such decision and the order based thereon the appellant appeals, contending that for the following reasons her claim to the disputed lands has been established.
(1)                                         A conveyance of her late husband (and subsequently to her) which she submits vests title in her to the land in dispute;

The decision of Rogers J. is now reported in (1990), 92 N.S.R. (2d) 254.
The material circumstances are that on June 19, 1989, Catherine McInnis, an unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old girl, applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal social assistance.
Her application was based on the eligibility category for ""expectant mothers"" under Municipal Social Assistance Policy 1.2.5 (M.S.A. Policy 1.2.5).
Delegated legislation cannot be broader than the enabling legislation and, therefore, in my opinion, the Appeal Board erred in treating the provision in question as creating a discretionary right to assistance.
It follows that the application to quash the Appeal Board's decision should have been granted for that reason alone.
For the foregoing reasons, it is my opinion that both the Appeal Board and Mr. Justice Rogers erred in the manner described.

CHIPMAN, J.A. dissenting","This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother.
The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance.
The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child.
Allowing the appeal,
that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act.
Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible.
It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children.
In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born.
The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","[1, 0, 200, 199, 198, 206, 11, 3, 188, 196, 187, 185, 104, 182, 183, 14, 201, 15, 101, 102, 153, 205, 16, 4, 100]"

The offence was committed at Joggins where, late in the evening and while intoxicated, the appellant fired shots from his 12‑gauge shotgun, first at the mobile home wherein the parents of his estranged wife lived and, second, at his brother‑in‑law, who was injured in the leg.
The latter was admitted to hospital for treatment.
The appellant contends the trial judge erred by placing undue emphasis on general deterrence and failing to adequately consider the circumstances of the offence and the offender.

The trial judge was right when he said that general deterrence must be a matter of primary concern.
The appellant cannot be described as a youthful first offender.
He was twenty‑eight years old when these offences were committed.
His record of criminal convictions begins in 1980.
Since then he has been convicted 19 times, without counting those instances when there have been multiple charges.
The majority are theft and property related offences.
In all the circumstances the sentence imposed by the trial judge contains no errors in law that warrant any variation on appeal.
While leave to appeal is granted, the appeal should be dismissed.

NOVA SCOTIA COURT OF APPEAL
FREDERICK W.L. BLACK 
JUDGMENT BY:","The respondents were granted an order by a Chambers judge pursuant to s. 38(1) of the Bankruptcy Act which authorized them to commence a fraud action against the appellant, a bankrupt.
In making his ruling, the Chambers judge found that the respondents were creditors of the bankrupt estate for the purposes of s. 38(1).
The respondents subsequently commenced an action against the appellant.
The appellant applied to the judge assigned to oversee the case management of the action for an order striking the Statement of Claim on the basis that the respondents were not creditors of the bankrupt estate and, therefore, should not have been granted the order authorizing the commencement of the action.
The case management judge held that he did not have the jurisdiction to inquire into the merit of the s. 38 order.
He dismissed the action.
The appellant appealed.

686,"The Criminal Code, s. 36 states that,  “provocation  includes, for the purposes of sections 34 and 35, provocation by blows, words or gestures.”
“Bodily harm” in s.2 “ means any hurt or injury to a person that interferes with the health or comfort of the person  and that is more than merely transient or trifling in nature.”
“Grievous bodily harm” is not defined.
Consequently, in assessing his conduct to determine the applicability of s.34 (1), I considered, along with my other impressions of the witnesses as they testified, the following:
(a)                the accused invited the complainant into the basement to wrestle where they had an unsatisfactory and unresolved contact;
Consequently, on the analysis that I have made, I find that there is insufficient evidence for me to conclude,  beyond a reasonable doubt,  that the accused caused bodily harm to the complainant.
This does not mean that the complainant did not suffer bodily harm.
It means, in my opinion, on the evidence before me and on the analysis that I have made, that the Crown has not proved beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of the offence as charged.
I find the accused, Craig Nickerson, not guilty, as charged,  and will enter an acquittal on the record.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm.
The complainant willingly took part in a fight club after which the accused followed him and engaged in a second physical altercation with him.

Accused not guilty of assault causing bodily harm.
The confrontation between the accused and the complainant was one continuing episodic event and the complainant's actions were provoked by the accused.

By the Court:
       Introduction
And to wrap up the “firearm” issue, I find that R. v. Sinclair, [2006]
Conclusion on the Firearms Trafficking Charges
My conclusions on the firearms trafficking charges can be summarized as follows:
I acquit Kyle Cater of Counts 9, 10, 11 and 12 on the firearms trafficking Information.
This concludes my reasons on all twenty-three charges against Kyle Cater.
For ease of reference, I dealt with the charges relating to the firearms seized at 80 Cavendish in paragraphs 178 – 182.
These reasons have been particularly lengthy.
This is due to the number of charges, my decision to go into the intercept evidence in considerable detail, and the way the case was defended.
I thank all counsel for their hard work and patience throughout what has been an unusually protracted case.","The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking.
The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms.
The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms.
A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession.
One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents.
Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm.
It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located.
However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed.
The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others.
The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities.
Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","[7, 10, 1065, 9, 13, 17, 16, 12, 1063, 11, 1059, 15, 0, 1066, 1060, 18, 1069, 1067, 1068, 1057]"

APPLICATION TO WITHDRAW GUILTY PLEA
[1]              This is an Application by the accused to set aside his guilty plea to count # 1, the sexual assault of his son.
Factual Background
[3]              The accused’s son was 8 years old at the time of the alleged offences.
The lengthy delay, while regrettable, has no bearing on the Court’s decision on this application.
On January 21, 2011 the Court adjourned to consider it’s decision.
By letter dated February 2, 2011 the Court notified counsel that the accused’s application to withdraw his guilty plea would be dismissed.
Although Nevin, supra, dealt with a motion to withdraw a guilty plea raised on appeal, the Court accepts this as the correct statement of the test to be applied on this application.
That the accused did not fully understand the effect and consequences of his plea, specifically it’s effect on his ability to have contact with his son.
Voluntariness of the Accused’s plea
There is nothing before this Court that raises a concern regarding the voluntariness of Mr. L.’s plea.
The Accused’s knowledge of the consequences of his guilty plea
The Evidence of Phil Josey
If so it does not affect the Court’s view of his evidence, or the Court’s conclusions.
Conclusion
Application dismissed.","The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea.
He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son.
The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography.
Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed;
the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault.
The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation.","[261, 0, 5, 259, 4, 258, 71, 70, 248, 15, 240, 17, 14, 237, 69, 239, 79, 85]"

Her Majesty the Queen
Judge:        The Honourable Justice Robert W. Wright
This disclaimer is indicative, in my view, that the accused’s decision whether to testify would more likely than not be the same in relation to both sets of counts.
In my view, the accused’s fair trial rights will not be impinged by reason of all counts being tried together and it is on that platform that the truth seeking function of the court will be better served.
Likewise, I decline to order severance of the status offences listed in the indictment.
Defence counsel argues that proof of those offences requires evidence of the accused’s prior criminal activity which would be prejudicial to him and which the court need not know about.
If this were to be a trial by jury, severance on that basis would be appropriate because of the risk of propensity reasoning by the trier of fact.
There is no such risk of propensity reasoning in a judge alone mode of trial and the court will not countenance otherwise.
For all of the foregoing reasons, this application for severance is dismissed on both the bases proposed.","The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed.
First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order.
It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day.
The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events.
The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates.
Application for severance dismissed.
The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn.
The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","[98, 99, 97, 0, 96, 1, 95, 2, 94, 6, 3, 91]"

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA
APPEAL DIVISION
Appellant
REASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY: MACDONALD, J.A.","The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years.
The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena.
The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial.
He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued.
The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial.
The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear.
He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial.
Dismissing the appeal,
(1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences.","[216, 1, 0, 220, 16, 215, 214, 18, 213, 212, 20, 19, 208, 211, 210, 21, 209, 25, 24, 205, 207, 3, 11, 206, 203, 204]"

If the Company is not profitable by then and if the matter is brought back before the Court, the Court may seriously consider imputing income to her if she doesn’t already by then seriously consider other options.
[27]         Regarding Section 7 expenses, I will not be varying paragraph 5 (a) of the Variation agreement that was incorporated into the Consent Variation Order, but for clarification purposes the orthodontic expenses that are being incurred for Dylan both past and future are to be shared by the parties proportionate to their incomes as and when those payments are due.
The amount to be shared is the net amount after taking into account any insurance coverage or tax savings, if any.
Costs are awarded to the Respondent in the amount of $1,000.00 to be paid by the Applicant within 60 days of October 15, 2008.
Halifax, Nova Scotia","The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally.
Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect.
The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income.
Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support.
She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find.
The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income.
Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue.
Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","[6, 49, 0, 50, 179, 180, 181, 51, 53, 52, 54, 55, 56, 58, 57, 59, 178, 173]"

BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD
Custodial Arrangements
[6]              What parenting arrangement is in the best interest of these children?
Many courts have attempted to describe what is meant by the term “best interest” .
The “best interests” of the child is regarded as an all embracing concept.
It does not state where transitions are to happen.
Presently they take place away from the parties residences.
This is unsatisfactory for the children but may lessen the potential for conflict.
The order reflecting this decision is to include the detail about drop off and pick up times and the place for transitions.
It is to include  arrangements for holidays, Christmas, March Break and summer vacation.
It is to include a clause providing the wife “ such other reasonable parenting time as the parties can agree upon”.
If the parties cannot agree upon the details and holiday parenting time I retain jurisdiction to resolve these issues.
CHILD SUPPORT
Therefore the wife shall continue to pay child support to the husband as is required by the terms of the Interim Order dated August 26, 2009. 
COSTS
Beryl MacDonald, J.S.C.","The parties were separated and had difficulty communicating.
They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three).
The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50).
She alleged the husband was abusive.
The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children.
Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times).
The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded.
If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that.
Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan.
Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation.
A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance.
Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.","[295, 4, 292, 291, 1, 288, 79, 81, 287, 80, 284, 82, 289, 78, 285, 87, 283, 282, 286]"

Judge:                           The Honourable Justice A.  David MacAdam
There is also the strong likelihood the Respondent will be moving to Sweden in the near future.
On questioning by the Court, the Petitioner acknowledged if there as to be spousal support, he also preferred it be by way of a lump sum award.
In these circumstances, clearly a lump sum spousal award is preferable and more likely to enable each party to “get on with the rest of the lives”.
Having decided there is a need and ability to pay, albeit diminishing in view of the evidence of the Petitioner that the major contract held by his company was not being renewed, a lump sum payment is preferable to periodic payments in these circumstances.
I am satisfied having regard to his education and obvious skills in computer programming, that he will be able to obtain the funds necessary to make a lump sum spousal support payment to the Respondent.
The evidence by the Respondent, supporting her lump sum claim, was far from satisfactory.
The Petitioner will therefore pay to the Respondent by way of lump sum spousal support, the sum of $10,000.00. ","In a divorce proceeding, the wife claimed lump sum spousal support in the amount of $20,000 to allow her to return to her native country.
She also claimed that periodic maintenance was not appropriate because of the difficulty of enforcement when she is living abroad and referenced two occasions when the husband was paying periodic support that she had to seek the assistance of Maintenance Enforcement.
The husband opposed paying any more spousal support but expressed a preference for lump sum support if he was required to pay more, as it would allow him to move on with his life with his new family.
Husband ordered to pay a lump sum award of $10,000 to wife;
when the parties moved to Nova Scotia, the husband was able to improve his financial situation, while the wife's position deteriorated.","[0, 156, 158, 1, 2, 153, 4, 3, 5, 6, 152, 7, 155, 151, 154]"

INCOMES OF THE PARENTS FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROVIDING CHILD SUPPORT
I find Mr. Thomson shall pay to Ms. Thomson for the support of the children the sum of $647.00 per month beginning June 1, 2006.
SECTION 7 EXPENSE                                                                       
         Ms. Thomson has been paying a party $800.00 a month since their separation to provide child care of their two children.
It is also ordered that both parties shall exchange copies of their Income Tax Returns completed and with all attachments even if the return is not filed along with all Notices of Assessment received from Canada Customs and Revenue Agency on an annual basis on or before June 1st of each year, commencing June 1st, 2006.

For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis.
In the divorce proceeding, the mother, who planned to remarry and relocate, sought to become the primary caregiver of the children, with the father to have access only every second weekend.
The father sought to vary the parenting time so that both parents would equally share their time with the children.
Current parenting arrangement to remain in effect with the parties retaining joint custody of the children; table amount of child support set.
The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base.","[0, 131, 115, 25, 1, 24, 2, 108, 26, 116, 114, 23, 130, 107]"

DIVORCE
2)       Ms. Bemister’s allegation that Mr. Bemister has failed to comply with the Separation Agreement requiring him to provide her with an automobile.
 VEHICLES
The husband covenants and agrees that the wife’s 1994 Suburban Motor Vehicle shall be replaced by the husband on or before December 31, 2001, with a mid-sized motor vehicle of equal value free and clear and registered in the wife’s name.
The wife shall have the aforesaid motor vehicle for her own exclusive use and ownership free and clear from any claim by the husband.
I take from that a recognition by Ms. Bemister that Mr. Bemister was possibly providing more vehicle than required in the Agreement and that she was accepting of it.
Given what transpired up to the vehicle’s breakdown, I find that, on Mr. Bemister’s returning the Jimmy to Ms. Bemister in running order with an up-to-date safety sticker,  Mr. Bemister will have substantially complied with his obligation pursuant to paragraph 11 of the Separation Agreement.  
I would request that counsel for Mr. Bemister prepare the order.","The parties were married for 10 years.
Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home.
Also at issue was the husband's obligation to provide the wife with an automobile pursuant to the separation agreement.
Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile.
The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year.
Although the wife did not establish any disadvantage from the marriage, there were disadvantages relating to its breakdown and her lifestyle deteriorated as result of the marriage ending.","[0, 17, 124, 97, 1, 18, 98, 99, 16, 26, 122, 123]"

She proposes to sell the home and put the proceeds – together with a new mortgage – toward the purchase of a new home.
In his counter-petition, Mr. Rhyno seeks an equal division of the matrimonial assets and joint custody of the children, with Ms. Guy having primary care and himself having liberal access.
PROPERTY DIVISION
The parties have the following matrimonial assets and debts:
Assets
matrimonial home         $105,000.00
RRSP (Guy)                 $11,799.62 (as of beginning of 2003)
I am not prepared to penalize Mr. Rhyno by confiscating his equity in the home.
It is sufficient to postpone his equity until the youngest child is 21 years old.
If Ms. Guy wishes to avail herself of a home in the area covered by the Shatford Trust Fund, she may do so, but she would be required to pay out Mr. Rhyno’s equity in the matrimonial home.
Ms. Guy would get the benefit of any principal reduction.
[39]           Ms. Guy will also have control of the trust fund, for which she will be required to account to Mr. Rhyno. 
As a result, no costs are awarded to either party.","The wife sought a divorce, custody, child support, a division of matrimonial assets and an order directing that the husband's equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child reached 19 years of age.
She proposed to sell the home and put the proceeds, together with a new mortgage, towards the purchase of a new home.
Joint custody awarded for all four children, with the father to have primary care and control of the oldest and the mother to have primary care and control of the three younger children; the father is to pay child support for three children in the guideline amount and the mother is to pay child support for one child in the guideline amount; the husband's equity in the matrimonial home is frozen at the amount owing on the mortgage when the parties separated and his interest is postponed until the youngest child reaches the age of 21 years; if the wife wishes to obtain a new home in a new location, she will be required to pay out the husband's equity in the matrimonial home.","[0, 208, 140, 141, 207, 206, 142, 1, 16, 143, 144, 15, 203, 202, 204]"

They have also not agreed on the division of their assets and debts or on the issue of child support.
It was agreed that the issue of custody would be heard by the Court first with the financial issues deferred to a later date.
BACKGROUND
The Respondent also seeks primary care.
ANALYSIS 
For all the reasons stated above, the Petitioner would appear to provide a better role model for the children than the Respondent.
    I am aware that whereas the Respondent is retired he might have more time available to spend with the children.
That alone however does not outweigh all the other considerations.
Both parties have the financial means to contribute to the support of the children and how that obligation will be shared will be determined at a later date.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the Petitioner shall have custody and primary care  of Abuchi and Nnkem.  
The Respondent will also have such other access as the parties agree to from time to time.
    I am prepared to hear both parties on the issue of costs after the evidence on all corollary issues has been heard.","Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue.
The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children.
Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices.
The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence.
Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother;
until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent.
Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","[0, 297, 282, 19, 283, 1, 281, 73, 296, 18, 278, 279, 20, 162, 280]"

If there are no future proceedings on this application, my decision would become final upon motion of one of the parties.
I conclude it is in these children’s best interests to forthwith implement all recommendations of the Court ordered assessment.
Kaylee and Maclean Patterson shall forthwith be placed in the primary care and custody of their father, Greg Patterson.
All other recommendations are to be implemented at the very earliest opportunity.

It may be inferred that members of the securities industry contract to regulate themselves because it is to their advantage to do so.
A party to such a contract cannot have it both ways; if he enjoys benefits from a contract which excludes government intervention from his profession, he cannot claim Charter protection when he is accused of breaching the conditions of his contract.
There was no error of law on Madam Justice Roscoe's part in finding that the Charter has no application in the present case.
Therefore the appellant will succeed on this appeal if, and only if, the record shows Madam Justice Roscoe committed reversible error in failing to determine that the disciplinary panel exceeded its jurisdiction or breached the rules of natural justice, which include bias.

The facts as found by the Residential Tenancies Board are that the tenants entered into a year to year lease in the standard form with respect to the premises in question on March 1, 1989.
The lease was automatically renewable at the expiration of the term unless either the landlord or the tenant had provided at least three months notice to terminate prior to the anniversary date of the lease.
In the present case no such notice was given and the lease automatically renewed itself as of March 1, 1990.
Despite the specific provision with respect to rent payable contained in the lease, the rent was raised from $500.00 per month to $515.00 per month effective May 1, 1989.

There may be cases where the defendants are able to advance evidence that causes a trial judge to rely on the prima facie effect of the Crown's evidence as stated in s. 174 (now s. 193).
It follows that here a consideration of the application of the provisions of the Charter by the summary conviction appeal court judge was unnecessary.
Thus there was error in law in allowing the appeals on the basis of Charter violations.
Accordingly, we grant leave to appeal and we find, for the reasons that we have given, that the appeals succeed.

It was found there by the owner of the lobster car before that conversation took place.
That the trial judge misconstrued that and other evidence is not the only problem.
The fact is that he relied upon the inadmissible conversation between Corporal Oldford and the appellant which he termed crucial, to reach his conclusion of guilt.

THE COURT:
The reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered orally by
This is an appeal from a corollary relief judgment of Mr. Justice Richard dividing matrimonial assets and from an order for support of the children of the marriage, with respect to its effective commencement date.
Mr. Justice Richard divided the matrimonial assets equally.
The appellant, the husband, contends that he should have included in those assets a money manager bank account.
The account was in the wife's name alone and was valued at $5,961.20 at the time of separation.
By the time of trial, this balance was reduced to approximately $100.00.
The wife's testimony was ‑that when she went back to work, the marriage was in difficulty and that it was unlikely that the parties would be staying together.

The primary issue in this appeal is whether certain conversations the trial judge had with counsel during the course of a trial create an apprehension or perception of bias, as that term is used in the law.
Briefly stated, the facts relative to the issue are these.
This case concerned a custody application in the Family Court involving two infant children.
They were voluntarily placed in the care of the appellants by their birth mother and her male companion who is the natural father of the younger of the two.
Before the judge at trial were parties with competing interests.
The appellants sought custody pursuant to the authority given them by the Minister of Community Services.

REASONS FOR
JUDGMENT BY:      JONES, J.A.","The appellant was convicted of failing a breathalyzer test.
The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity.
He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence.
The appellant appealed.

that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown.","[86, 0, 1, 92, 10, 2, 84, 85, 66, 83, 87, 91, 12, 11, 3, 59, 9, 13, 58, 82, 67, 65, 57, 14, 56, 55, 60, 15]"

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
THE COURT:                        Appeal and cross appeal both dismissed without costs as per oral reasons for judgment of Flinn, J.A.; Glube, C.J.N.S. and Oland, J.A. concurring.
[1]                                 This appeal is from a decision of Justice Hamilton of the Supreme Court in an assessment of damages arising out of an automobile accident.
The respondent admitted liability for driving his truck into the back of the appellant’s motor vehicle.
The trial judge described the accident as “a very mild rear end collision.”
[2]                                 At the heart of this appeal is the finding of the trial judge that the accident in question did not contribute materially to the appellant’s present poor health, and that the accident caused only a mild aggravation of the appellant’s pre-existing, and major, back problem.
The trial judge found the appellant’s evidence to be lacking in credibility.
In our opinion, and in the circumstances of this case, that award cannot be said to be so far outside the range of damages for like cases as to be considered a wholly erroneous estimate of damages.
                        The appeal and cross appeal are both dismissed.
There will be no order for costs.
Concurred in:","Liability was admitted for a very mild rear end collision.
The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health.
It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem.
The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000.
The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded.
The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed.
Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed.
No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility.
There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment.
Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs.
Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages.","[15, 44, 16, 43, 9, 42, 17, 41, 1, 2, 14, 18, 19]"

By the Court:
On December 13, 2010 the police stopped a car driven by Candace MacDonald.
The circumstantial evidence does not support the inference, in the absence of anything else, that Mr. Brooks was just wrong.
If M.M. robbed Nykell Brooks, why didn’t Mr. Brooks describe him or identify him when given the opportunity?
That important question remains unresolved.
The narrative is incomplete.
There is an inconsistency in the story that is so important that it raises a reasonable doubt.
That doubt applies to all of the charges.
The Crown has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that M.M. was involved in the robbery, assault, confinement or threatening of Nykell Brooks.
It has proven that he was in a vehicle, with the stolen property and the gun.
It has not proven that he was involved in the robbery and because of that there is no evidence that he knew or should have known that he was in a car with a gun or stolen property.","The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery.
A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery.
The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men.
While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger.
At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened.
Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person.
Accused found not guilty on all charges;
the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car.
Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","[8, 203, 9, 7, 204, 5, 201, 12, 0, 13, 11, 202, 199, 200, 198, 197, 14, 195]"

W. BRUCE GILLIS, Barrister and Solicitor
Defendant 
This is an action by Farm Credit Corporation (FCC) against the defendant, W. Bruce Gillis, a barrister and solicitor practising in Middleton, Nova Scotia.
Basically, it is a claim in professional negligence against Mr. Gillis for the losses sustained by FCC as a result of the alleged negligence of Gillis.
The matter originated in the late fall of 1978 when the mortgagors, Paul and Eric Langille, farmers in the Middleton area, negotiated a loan to be secured by a mortgage on real estate known as the ""Phinney farm"".
By letter of December 5, FCC confirmed that funds would be available to the Langilles.
One of the conditions in paragraph 4 of the letter states:
""That you are willing to supply the Corporation with a valid milk assignment to repay your mortgage loan on a monthly basis.
The exact amount of the monthly payments shall be determined at the time the loan is disbursed and you shall be advised of the amount required.""
One such condition was contained in clause D. ""SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS"" :
( c)     Award
(i)                        Non‑pecuniary Damages               79

Continental had applied to the Commission for a refund of the tax paid on certain refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring in Shelburne, Nova Scotia.
This product was mainly to be supplied on contract to the Soviet Union.
The contract contained stringent quality specifications governing the processing of this product which included a phase where the pickling occurs in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to ‑2ºC.
In the latter case Evershed M.R. stated at p. 1351;
This would mean that the tax paid relevant to the J. H. Lock contract in the amount of $41,335.50 should be refunded.
In the result, the appeal is allowed and the appellant is awarded its costs.

DECISION OF JUSTICE KELLY","The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act.
The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.'
The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures.
The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product.
For the plaintiff,
that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","[0, 14, 118, 15, 17, 117, 16, 18, 116, 13, 115, 1, 114, 113, 19, 20, 21, 112, 22, 111, 109, 110, 108, 25, 24, 2, 12, 104, 26]"

CANADA PENSION PLAN SECURITY
Research and the statistics that are available disclose beyond question the the majority of female spouses in traditional marriages suffer serious economic disadvantage, if not impoverishment, after divorce.
The words of Galligan, J. in the 1971 case of Moynes v. Moynes and DeJong, R.F.L. Vol. 4 245 are exclusive of the reference to conduct of the parties valid today.
In any event, I am simply trying to stress the need to address the requirement of security particularly in a long traditional marriage and that the courts should be provided with the specifics of Canada Pension Plan pension entitlement for both parties.
FINANCES
Other than these comments and the addressing of the omission in the agreement for drug coverage, her budget is also modest, however, she needs the drug coverage and cannot handle such an expense on the total means available to her.
OMISSIONS ‑ DRUGS
In addition, Mr. Durocher shall have the option of exploring coverage through the payment of a premium provided that the same basic $1,800 maximum on tendering receipts coverage is available to Mrs.
SUMMARY
September 25, 1991","In this divorce action the petitioner sought to have a separation agreement entered into by the parties incorporated into the corollary relief judgment.
The respondent sought to have the separation agreement set aside on the grounds of duress, undue influence or unconscionsability.
The couple had a traditional marriage.
The petitioner earned $48,000 per year.
The wife did not work outside the home and suffered from severe arthritis.
For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage,
that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside.
The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress.
The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","[495, 490, 6, 444, 1, 0, 8, 4, 443, 489, 476, 7, 430, 429, 423, 475]"

The above paragraphs indicate that Anthony Poirier required a series of operations and skin grafts and very extensive medical treatment.
The plaintiff also refers to a number of cases including Sabbas v. Golobic, a decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, November 15, 1989.
In this case an 11 year old girl suffered injuries, the main one being a dislocated hip.
Such a loss is very difficult to quantify.
I consider the only appropriate way to compensate him is to award a lump sum for this loss which is separate and apart from the non‑pecuniary damage.
For the restriction in future employment and financial consequences that will follow from that, I award further compensation of $21,000.00

This application involves damages claimed for mental distress following an aborted real estate transaction.
I allowed the plaintiffs' several claims for special damages (more particularly described, infra) but reserved on the issue of damages for mental distress until I had a chance to consider the authorities.
All of these cases consider the proposition that when the parties entered their contract they considered that a breach in certain circumstances would cause the plaintiff mental distress.
That approach was taken by Linden, J. in Brown v. Walterloo Regional Board of Commissioners of Police (1982) 1982 CanLII 1939 (ON SC), 136 D.L.R. (3d) 49.
An action was started by Brown, former chief of police claiming damages for wrongful dismissal.
Linden, J. found for the plalintiff and included as damages a further award of $10,000.00 for mental suffering.
The Board of Police Commissioners appealed, successfully.
While allowing the appeal and striking the award for mental suffering, Weatherston, J.A. left open the door for such a claim in other circumstances.
In conclusion I assess total damages and order judgment for the plaintiffs in the amount of $12,658.61.

BACKGROUND
The parties to this action cohabited for approximately twelve years from 1975 to 1988.
Her mobile home was subject to a mortgage.
At the time of separation her assets consisted of the half interest in the parties' residence and another vacant lot, furniture and a car.
She had debts, excluding the mortgage on the residence of approximately $45,000, leaving her in a negative net worth situation.
""   Another particularly interesting ruling in Sorochan is that 'the reasonable expectation of the claimant in obtaining an actual interest in the property as opposed to monetary relief, constitutes another important consideration in determining if the constructive trust remedy is appropriate.'
JOINTLY HELD PROPERTY
made above.
PERSONAL EFFECTS
The major item of personalty that is in dispute is a 1981 Cadillac which was purchased in 1982 or 1983 by Mr. McGill for $13,000.00.
Mr. McGill also claims an ownership interest in some of the items in possession of Mrs. Keddy.
CONCLUSION
For these reasons the plaintiff shall be entitled to enter judgment against the defendant for the following amounts:
This ruling on costs is subject to submissions which may be made by counsel respecting any pre‑trial offers to settle made by Mr. McGill or Mrs. Keddy.

 Defendant","The parties lived together for some 12 years before separating in 1988.
The plaintiff was 53 and the defendant 60.
The plaintiff sought an order under the Partition Act for the partition and sale of two properties owned jointly and a division of property owned by the defendant based on a constructive trust.
The defendant owned and operated residential rental properties.
The plaintiff, who had stopped working as a medical records technician in 1988, maintained the household and assisted in the business by answering phones, bookkeeping, showing apartments and helping with minor repairs.
(1) that the plaintiff met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment by virtue of the plaintiff's contributions of time and money, namely (a) an enrichment, (b) a corresponding deprivation, and (c) the absence of any juristic reason for the enrichment.
The proper remedy was an award of monetary damages representing 25% of the increase in the value of the defendant's assets during the relationship, not the imposition of a constructive trust; and (2) jointly held properties were to be sold pursuant to the Partition Act, unless the plaintiff elected to buy out the defendant's one half interest within 30 days.
Prejudgment interest was calculated from the date of separation to September 1, 1991, at 10% per year.","[1, 348, 6, 353, 14, 7, 333, 346, 16, 21, 318, 300, 334, 317, 77, 345, 76, 22, 23, 331, 319, 13, 75, 203]"

After having heard counsel further on December 20, 1990, I granted the application with written reasons for so doing to follow.
From her search of the records at the Registry of Deeds she is not able to pinpoint the location of the 20' of missing frontage and fears that it could be up to one half of the frontage of the lot in question.
Property history
Thus the missing frontage may actually be 21'.
Findings re Objection # 1
That plan, the later plan dated 1961, the assessment records referred to, and the evidence contained in the statutory declarations are all consistent with occupation and ownership by Rosina Killam and her successors in title.
Section 2(b) of the Escheats Act provides:
Although mere speculation, I suspect that the mystery of the missing frontage bears on that Killam residence lot, rather than on the lot in question.

The court in the CDIC case, in fact, assumed supervisory jurisdiction over the winding up process as well as over the estate solicitors.

Mr. Beveridge submits that there was no evidence before the learned judge upon which to properly base his conclusion.
As a preliminary argument Mr. Beveridge contends that the scope of review of the committing judge's decision by this court is broader in this type of application, i.e. Habeas Corpus with Certiorari in aid, than in an application for Certiorari relief alone.
He contends the scope is broadened by the provisions of the Liberty of the Subject Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c.253 and the uncodified common law relating to habeas corpus relief.
He concedes, however, that the test to be applied in this application, which may, in his view, be broader than the test applied in an application for ""certiorari"" alone, is the test applied by MacDonald, J.A. in R. v. Lapierre (1976), 15 N.S.R. (2d) 361 (A.D.) where he states:
The evidence should be found sufficient if the reviewing court can say that on such evidence a jury, properly instructed and acting judicially could convict; any doubt on this question must be resolved in favour of the Crown.
February 5, 1992
Respondents ","This was an application for an Order in the nature of Habeas Corpus and Certiorari in aid.
The applicant had been charged with the first degree murder of her estranged husband.
The judge at preliminary inquiry concluded that there was evidence adduced that the accused had paid money to the man who had killed the victim the day after the killing, that she was involved in cleaning the apartment where the killing took place after the body was removed, and that the accused and the man who killed the victim had discussed the matter prior to the event, and thus there was sufficient evidence upon which a 'properly instructed jury may find...[the accused] guilty...'
The appellant contended that the judge had applied the wrong test for committal.
Dismissing the application,
that the question is not whether the judge correctly verbalized the test, but rather if the evidence supported the committal, and there was, indeed, enough circumstantial evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting reasonably in accordance with those instructions, could convict the accused of first degree murder.","[91, 4, 3, 5, 8, 82, 35, 38, 37, 40, 36, 21]"

HEARD:                                 At Halifax, Nova Scotia, before the Honourable Justice John Davison November 2, 1993
There is no finality to the orders made under the Family Maintenance Act, nor was there any finality to the order made by Judge MacDonald.
The order was made under Section 37 of the Act and by the clear, plain meaning of the words of the Act it is subject to variation.
In this respect, I agree with the decision of Butler, J.F.C. in Mahoney v. Woodside (1988) 95 N.S.R. (2d) 1.
The common‑law obligation for a parent to support a child by maintenance is incorporated in the Family Maintenance Act in Section 8.
It seems clear to me that Judge Levy erred when he thought he could not consider the application before him.
It is equally clear to me that he did not consider the application before him because if he had he would have called upon the applicant and the respondent to adduce material evidence.
For all the foregoing reasons, the appeal succeeds and I direct that the matter be sent back to Judge Levy for a hearing on the merits.
No costs will be awarded.
Halifax, Nova Scotia","This was an appeal of a decision which denied variation of a maintenance award where a lump sum had been previously ordered.
The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application.
Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court,
that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation.
The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances.
Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act.","[0, 76, 74, 2, 75, 1, 72, 73, 3, 4, 71, 6, 5, 69, 70, 68]"
737,"BARRY NEIL MOSHER
Petitioner
THE PROPERTY AND FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PARTIES
For the past year Ms. Mosher has been paid support based on an interim consent order requiring spousal and child support of $2,500 a month.
The parties have agreed that they can adjust these payments to the date of a new order for support.
After considering all of these factors, I am satisfied that an appropriate spousal and child support amount would be $4,500 per month.
Because Ms. Mosher will not be able to work to any significant extent during her nine‑month training period and still adequately
perform her home and childcare duties, a further $500 per month will be payable as additional support during that period.
EQUALIZATION CONSIDERATIONS
This is a situation where Mr. Mosher has maximized his earning potential during the course of the marriage while Ms. Mosher has significantly restricted her career development by accepting primary responsibility for the homemaking and childcare duties.
By virtue of the agreed custody arrangement, this economic limitation will continue.
I find that this continued inequality can be reflected by a compensatory or lump sum award of $18,000, to be paid in three annual payments of $6,000, commencing on November 30, 1993.
Halifax, Nova Scotia","The parties lived together for 14 years and had three children, aged eight, 13 and 14.
The petitioner always worked and eventually became a successful stockbroker.
The respondent was employed part-time doing minimum wage jobs and was responsible for the household duties and raising their children.
The petitioner's annual income was $50,000 at the time of separation, but escalated to $200,000 in 1992 and was prone to great fluctuation.
The respondent was to have custody of the children.
She sought spousal and child support and an unequal division of assets.
Ordering support and an unequal division of assets.
The court extensively reviewed the case of Moge v. Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L.(3d) 345 (S.C.C.) and found that marriage and child care responsibilities hinder a wife's role in the workplace.
The court awarded $4500 per month as spousal and child support, plus an additional $500 while the wife retrained.
The court considered this an appropriate case for an unequal division of matrimonial assets in the respondent's favour.
Finding that the awards were still not sufficient to satisfy the respondent's needs, a lump sum award of $18,000 was ordered.

This matter was heard by me on March 17th and 18th, 1993 and adjourned for decision.
The action was commenced by the plaintiff for the alleged breach of contract of a written contract between the parties and damages therefore, or, in the alternative, damages for unjust enrichment.
The defendants have counterclaimed for damages based on alleged negligent misrepresentation on the part of the plaintiff.
Clause 40 of the written contract reads as follows:
Mr. Thurber testified that he was aware of the concerns of Nova as to possible regulatory and bureaucratic problems and he inserted this clause to protect them.
I accept the submission by counsel for the defendants that this clause should be interpreted in a ""purposive"" manner to protect the interests which the parties sought to protect by inserting the provision into an otherwise standard form document.
With deference, I think parol evidence should be admitted because in my opinion the wording of the Clause 40 is ambiguous and does not adequately address the problem which it attempted to resolve.

The defendants counterclaimed for damages based on alleged negligent misrepresentation by the plaintiff.
The plaintiff had agreed to supply and erect a large sign for the defendant.
The agreement was subject to receiving approval from the Department of Highways for a changeable message centre which was to be part of the sign.

The message centre was never activated, although the equipment was in place at the defendant's warehouse.
Dismissing the claim for breach of contract and allowing the unjust enrichment claim,
that government approval was a condition precedent to the agreement.
Since approval was not forthcoming, the contract was null and void.
The plaintiff's alternative claim for unjust enrichment was allowed against the corporate defendant, based on a reasonable monthly rental.

Mr. Hiltz, age 33, is married with three children, ages 7, 6 and 2.
In my opinion, Mr. Hiltz is left with myofascial or chronic pain, mainly relating to his left hip.
He still suffers pain which restricts some of his activities causing loss of enjoyment.
He does not have pain all day every day, but he exercises care in what he is doing because he fears he will cause himself more pain.
Also his personality has changed and his recreational life has been affected.
Counsel made submissions on pre judgment interest.
There was no evidence which leads to the conclusion that the plaintiff was responsible for undue delay in bringing this case to trial.
In choosing the appropriate interest rate, in my opinion, the award of $25,000.00 reflects an award for chronic pain syndrome as suffered by the plaintiff as of this date and not four and a half years ago when the accident occurred.

The first ground of appeal alleged that the trial judge was in error by permitting the complainant to testify behind a screen without first conducting a voir dire and by relying solely upon the representations of Crown counsel to the effect that she would be uncomfortable without a screen.
Even if it could be said that the trial judge had improperly exercised his discretion under s. 482 (2.1) of the Code we cannot say that the fairness of the trial was in any way impaired and would find that no miscarriage of justice occurred.

ARMOYAN PROPERTIES LIMITED, a body corporate 
From the outset, Haverstock has questioned the appropriateness of the process under the Ditches and Water Courses Act.
The Act does not abrogate this common law.
THE AWARD
A further analysis of Dr. Waller's award is advisable.
Following an introductory recitation of Dr. Waller's retainer and the steps taken in the process, Dr. Waller set forth his interpretation of the Act.
There has been no compliance with the provisions of the Expropriation Act and, therefore, Dr. Waller's conclusion as to Armoyan's right to act as he prescribed is incorrect.
I conclude that the Act is not an appropriate means for the resolution of the difficulties faced by Armoyan and the County in this case.
Where the Haverstock lands are not to be benefited by the installation of a ditch or drain and the Estate has not consented to the construction of same, the Act is not applicable.
SCOPE OF APPEAL
In any event, I have also concluded that s. 12 would give me the powers to hear the matter de novo if it were necessary.
COSTS
I award costs in the amount of $3,000.00 all inclusive to the appellant as against the respondent.","The respondent had undertaken the residential development of certain lands bordering the appellant's property and constructed roadways which it proposed to convey to the Department of Transportation, who agreed to accept with the consent of owners of property where water would drain from the road.
When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement.
The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer.
The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions.
In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act.
Allowing the appeal,
that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost.
However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch.
Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems.","[166, 163, 162, 159, 2, 158, 134, 157, 135, 4, 102, 133, 156, 136]"

In concluding the decision, this court stated:
The plaintiff submits the passage of time is accountable by the youth of the plaintiff, the normal time to bring a case to trial, court delays and the nature of the injuries that she suffered.
The long periods of inactivity in prosecuting this matter are not now to be justified because the prognosis for Ms. Bezanson is less optimistic than it earlier had been.
If the delay is to be justified because her recovery is less than the doctors had expected, then counsel could never, without risk of being sued, either effect a settlement or proceed to trial, until a claimant has either totally recovered or the expert opinions on the degree of continuing disability are such as to leave little, if any, chance of being either too optimistic or unrealistic in their assessment of the degree or permeance of disability.
The impact of such a position on civil litigation and the resolution of civil disputes is untenable.
The plaintiff is, therefore, entitled to interest for a period of three and one-
half years.

COUNSEL:                              Robert Fetterly, for the Prosecution 
The additional aggravating factor there, not present here, was the conviction for break and enter.
T.V.G., you maintain your innocence, as you are entitled to do ‑ however, a jury of twelve has found you guilty of sexual assault upon Ms. B.S..
You must understand what you have done.
This was not a stolen romantic moment with a hesitant partner, but a violent assaultive act, the effects of which will stay with Ms. B.S. always ‑ and what a sad example for your daughter.
In addition, under s.100(1) of the Criminal Code, I order that you shall not have in your possession any firearm, ammunition, or explosive substance for a period of ten years.
In view of T.V.G.'s financial circumstances, and the fact that he is facing a lengthy period of incarceration, I am not going to impose a victim fine surcharge.","The defendant was convicted by a jury of sexually assaulting his common law spouse.
They had separated; she continued to reside in the home with the children.
Because of his repeated phone calls, she became afraid to stay in the house.
She took the children to her father's house.
The defendant entered the house in the night and assaulted the complainant when she returned to pick up some clothes.
Imposing a sentence of two years eight months, plus a ten year firearm prohibition, that this offence could be categorized as a major sexual assault.
The principles of sentencing and the impact on the victim, especially in view of the fact that she was his common-law spouse, made this sentence fit.","[3, 112, 6, 4, 5, 108, 111, 109, 8, 7, 107, 9, 106]"

MANDATORY STATUTORY PROVISIONS
Section 541 dictates what the Judge of the Preliminary Inquiry will do following presentation of all the evidence called by the prosecution.
On page 398 to 401 of the transcript, the following exchanges took place:
“THE COURT:   I was just going to exclude ah Lauchie Campbell and ah..is it Mr. Oliver...ifs Keeping.?
Yes it's Cecil James Keeping., Oliver and Keeping maybe seated.
MR. RANISETH:  Your Honour with respect to my client I would ah like...
THE COURT: Exclude her too?
THE COURT: And that is?
THE COURT:  Yes, Barbara Keeping.
Neither do I believe the words ""your opportunity to speak out and and so on"" are to the ""like effect"" of the words of Section 541(1).
The avoidance of the literal formality of the required reading of Section 541 should not be so easily accomplished.
In my opinion the learned Judge neglected the mandatory requirements of Section 541 in respect to Barbara Keeping and Cecil James Keeping and Lauchie Campbell and their committal for trial should therefore be quashed.
ROBERT MACDONALD 
JUSTICE","This is an application by way of certiorari to quash the committal order of the preliminary inquiry judge.
Quashing three of the 11 committals,
that the judge failed to follow the literal formality of s. 541(1) of the Criminal Code.
After specifically excluding the three from the reading of s. 541(1), the judge simply reminded them they had heard the reading on the previous day.
The jurisdiction of the preliminary inquiry judge was also discussed.","[212, 119, 120, 211, 121, 122, 208, 123, 124, 209, 207, 125, 126, 1, 5, 127]"
746,"TO PUBLISHERS OF THIS CASE:
PLEASE TAKE NOTE that s. 38(1) of the Young Offenders Act applies and this decision may require editing before publication.
Section 38(1) provides:
""38(1)                  Subject to this section, no person shall publish by any means any report
(a)     of an offence committed or alleged to have been committed by a young person, unless an order has been made under section 16 with respect thereto; or
(b)     of any hearing, adjudication, disposition or appeal concerning a young person who committed or is alleged to have commited an offence
In my respectful opinion, in spite of the thorough review of the facts and the finding on credibility, the two paragraphs at the end of the decision lead to the conclusion that a reasonable apprehension of bias exists.
Having found that, I need go no further as such a finding requires that a new trial be ordered.
As I find there must be a new trial, I do not propose to deal with the suggested error in ruling certain evidence inadmissible.
That will be a matter for decision by the trial judge hearing the new trial.
In conclusion, the appeal is allowed and a new trial is ordered in front of a different trial judge.
Halifax, Nova Scotia","The young offender appealed his convictions contending an apprehension of bias on the part of the Youth Court Judge who made comments about the police and non-white accused.
The Judge also wrote supplementary reasons after the appeal was filed.
Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial in front of a different trial judge,
that there was no evidence before the Youth Court Judge as to the comments made.
The court applied an objective test and concluded a reasonable apprehension of bias existed.
Supplementary reasons should not be written without a request from the Court of Appeal.","[15, 16, 101, 100, 99, 18, 17, 102, 98, 19, 97, 20]"

Lost wages (John Burton):
Loss of sale of property to one Charles Dorrington:                                                            200.000.00
The plaintiffs are also claiming $200,000.00 for general damages making a total claim of $447,358.31.
The evidence regarding the loss of sale claim is a statement of John Burton that he discussed a sale with one Charles Dorrington at a price of $200,000.00.
(See Exhibit 2, Tab 4).
There is no other evidence, no agreement of sale or other contract document and Mr. Dorrington is deceased since 1994.
Counsel for the defendants allege contributory negligence by the plaintiffs should be found and assessed alleging that their negligence with regard to receiving notices of the tax sale and their failure to meet their obligations as owners of property, amounts to contributory negligence.
Though their behaviour was, perhaps, less than that of a prudent property owner, I cannot agree that it should be held to make them liable for any of the loss claimed.
The situation here is not one to which the doctrine of contributory negligence would apply.
The plaintiffs are entitled to their costs in accordance with Tariff A, Scale 3, at an amount involved rounded out to $15,000.00.
March 27, 1997","The defendant municipality sold property owned by the plaintiffs at a tax sale.
Because of disputes over ownership between the plaintiffs and the purchaser, the latter commenced an action against the plaintiffs seeking a declaration as to the validity of the tax deed.

The plaintiffs sought to recover their legal fees from the municipality and the Attorney General together with some other items of loss and general damages.
Awarding damages to the property while the plaintiffs were out of possession and bank interest for the same period,
that there is no evidence to warrant an award for general damages.

DECISION
The plaintiff, Kathy Marie MacLean, claims against the defendant Empire Theatres Limited for injuries sustained when she fell and injured herself on premises occupied by the defendant.
I don't believe she does know where she tripped because it happened too fast.
THE LAW
The law involved in this case is occupier's liability.
That case has been adopted by our Courts for many years.
I find no negligence on the part of the defendant using the standard set out in Brown v. B. And F. Theatres Ltd, (supra).
Based on my finding I would dismiss the plaintiff's claim and award costs to the defendant.
Despite my finding against the plaintiff on liability, I would, however, deal with the plaintiff's claim for damages in case my finding on liability is overturned.
DAMAGES
The plaintiff sustained a significant laceration to her head.
The cut was five and one-half centimeters long and located in the middle of her forehead extending beyond her hairline.
The medical evidence does not detail the complaints other than the cut to her head.
The plaintiff, through counsel, submits that damages should be $10,000.00 for pain and suffering.
Based on the evidence of the plaintiff, I would award damages for pain and suffering in the amount of $6,000.00 if she had been successful on liability.","The plaintiff fell while entering a canteen operated by the defendant.
She claimed to have tripped on the concrete sidewalk located in front of the canteen.
Others testified that she tripped on the door threshold of the building.
Dismissing the claim,
that the plaintiff's evidence of where she tripped is unreliable.
Furthermore, there was no unusual danger on the premises.","[158, 140, 6, 0, 141, 7, 157, 139, 96, 97, 138, 156, 142, 137, 99, 95, 16]"

RELEASED:          November 22, 1999
COUNSEL:  Jean McKenna, solicitor for the defendants
Milton J. Veniot, Q.C., solicitor for the plaintiff
There is no dispute as to the motor vehicle accident that resulted in this action.
I have considered the totality of the evidence put forward herein, and do not find on the balance of probabilities that Bertha Langille was “employed at the date of the accident.”
I find further that the plaintiff has not shown that she worked for any six months out of the preceding 12 months and so does not fall within the deeming  provisions.
The plaintiff has not been able to satisfy  the threshold employment requirement and so cannot succeed on this claim against Guardian.
It has not been necessary to consider the evidence relative to her continued disability.
I find that she is not entitled to any benefit under Schedule “B”.
REPAYMENT
It is the defendant, Guardian’s position that the plaintiff cannot show that she was employed at the time of the accident.
Therefore, it is entitled to the repayment of the money it paid to her under Schedule “B”.
Costs in favour of the defendant.
I will accept written submission if the parties cannot agree.
                                    Chief Justice Joseph P. Kennedy","The plaintiff was injured as a result of a motor vehicle accident.
The defendant was found liable.
At issue was the claim of the plaintiff against the defendant's insurer for Section B benefits.
The defendant paid benefits for 129 weeks.
It claimed that the plaintiff misrepresented her employment status at the time of the accident, and that the benefits should be re-paid.
The plaintiff argued in response that the defendant was estopped from claiming repayment.
Ordering the benefits be re-paid,
that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation, on the basis of representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it.
It would be illogical to prevent the defendant from getting its money back when it is found that the benefits were paid on the basis of faulty information provided by the plaintiff.
This is not a situation in which estoppel lies against the defendant.","[202, 179, 180, 201, 200, 9, 178, 177, 10, 11, 181, 176, 12, 13, 175, 174]"

Aulden Pottie, Raymond Stevens and his girlfriend, Tara Dunn, were passengers in the motor vehicle owned and operated by Cathy Hawes.
They were accompanied by persons in two other motor vehicles.
The finger would have been broken anyway and the damages for it not reduced at all.
It is probable that the injuries to Mr. Pottie’s shoulders would not have happened if he was wearing a seat belt.
I would reduce damages by 20 per cent.
Conclusion
The plaintiff, Cathy Hawes, will recover her costs from the defendants.
The plaintiff, Aulden Pottie, will recover 80% of his costs from the defendants.
I will accept written submissions on the amount of costs from counsel.

Justice
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia","The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night.
Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation.
The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand.
She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back.
The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg.
He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy.
General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt).
The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it.
The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.","[6, 0, 458, 7, 459, 8, 11, 9, 457, 13, 12, 14, 10, 456, 20, 15, 447, 442, 19, 454, 446, 445, 453]"

An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended.
The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists.
The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger.
Judgment for the plaintiff;
there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger.
There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.","[258, 257, 256, 262, 267, 264, 266, 261, 897, 269, 265, 260, 896, 268, 255, 263, 2, 270, 895, 0, 893, 277, 254, 271, 3]"

[1]                    The real issue in the application before the court is whether Saskatchewan Mutual Insurance Company (“SMI”) was in a special relationship of insurer with the plaintiffs that carried a duty of good faith and fair dealing.
The plaintiffs are policy holders of the defendant SMI.
This policy is not an issue in the action commenced by the plaintiffs and is not relied on for coverage in respect of the claim.
SMI is the insurer for the defendants and is involved in this claim by virtue of a policy of insurance with the defendants.
This situation is a further example of how the plaintiffs’ initial position on the existence of a duty to the plaintiffs in the circumstances of this action is misguided.
The defendant has been successful in its application to strike the claim as it relates to SMI.
The plaintiffs have been unsuccessful in their application to amend their claim to include the agents and employees of SMI as party defendants.
Hopefully the plaintiffs can get on with what this action is really about, which is the claim remaining by the plaintiffs against the neighbouring farmers who are alleged to have allowed chemical to drift onto the plaintiffs’ field and destroy their crop.","Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility
HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it.
The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants.
SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance.
The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation.
The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs.
Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured.
The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success.
The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material.
The improper material included information on settlement discussions.","[17, 20, 21, 229, 0, 22, 230, 19, 225, 232]"

J. Rybchuk, J","Criminal Law – Recognizance
The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece.
He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012.
The Crown then applied for a third recognizance.
An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over.
A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend.
The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code.
The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults.
He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated.
While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming.
As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years.
HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","[7, 250, 0, 230, 249, 231, 248, 32, 34, 35, 229, 33, 228, 226, 232]"

APPENDIX A
VERSUS
ADMISSION OF FACTS FOR VOIR DIRE
The accused, A.M.B. (the “Accused”), through her Counsel, admits the following matters of fact  for the purpose of dispensing with proof at the voir dire herein:
That on the 19th of December, 2011, the Regina Police Service executed a Criminal Code search warrant at the residence located at 6415 Hird Crescent, Regina, Saskatchewan (the “Residence”).
That a Samsung camera was located by Cpl. Lisa Davey (Cpl. Davey”) on the kitchen counter.
These admissions are submitted and filed by consent of the Prosecutor and Defence Counsel.
Dated this    21  day of May, 2013.

Carmen Choi                                                                                    Christina Skibinsky for","Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code.
The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son.
The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband.
The parties were separated.
The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child.
After this RCMP were contacted.
On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained.
During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it.
They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach.
Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded.
The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography.
The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO.
The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above.
However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”.
When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home.
She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house.
She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle.
During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures.
He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs.
Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant.
Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included.
The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence.
The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her.
The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction.
The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources.
The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model.
The purpose of including the information was not made clear.
The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore.
The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused.
Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him.
The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?
 HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided.
The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded.
The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant.
The impact of the breach on the accused was serious.
Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well.
The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest.
The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","[0, 275, 291, 290, 269, 274, 8, 1, 7, 276, 289, 277, 278, 12, 288, 11]"

[1]               Jim Dallyn is charged with the offence of driving faster than 60 kilometres per hour when passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone.
The offence is alleged to have occurred on September 5, 2013, on Highway 55 near Peerless, Saskatchewan.  
[2]               Subsection 203(1) of The Traffic Safety Act governs the offence:
Speed limits when passing highway workers
No person shall drive a vehicle on a highway at a speed greater than 60 kilometres per hour when passing:
(a) a highway worker or flag person;
In paragraph 8 of his affidavit, he says that there were highway workers and occupied highway equipment in the speed monitored zone.
Nowhere does he say that:
1.      he observed the Dallyn vehicle apparently travelling above the speed limit when it passed highway workers or highway equipment and that he recorded the vehicle’s speed immediately after it passed the workers or equipment, or 
2.      the Dallyn vehicle actually was passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment when the speed monitoring device recorded its speed.
For these reasons, I find Jim Dallyn not guilty.
M.F. Martinez, J","Criminal Law – Strict LiabilityStatutes – Interpretation – Traffic Safety Act, Section 203(1)Traffic Safety Act – Motor Vehicle Offences – Passing Highway Workers or Equipment
The accused was charged with an offence contrary to s. 203(1) of The Traffic Safety Act, driving over 60 km/h passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone.
The accused was charged as the owner of the vehicle, not necessarily the driver.
The offence was the result of a speed monitoring camera and the Act allows the Crown to complete their case without calling any witnesses.
The accused testified that he did not speed past any highway workers or equipment.
He said that he was following a pilot vehicle when he passed the workers and equipment and only sped up after the pilot vehicle turned around when there were no more workers or equipment.
The picture of the accused’s vehicle from the speed monitoring camera did not show any highway workers or equipment.
HELD: The person who tested and deployed the speed monitoring camera provided affidavit evidence that the picture was taken within a marked construction area but it did not say that the accused was speeding as he was passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment.
Section 203(1) specifies that there is only an offence for travelling at a speed greater than 60 km/h when passing highway workers or operating equipment.

The respondent is in receipt of CPP benefits of $6,540.00 per annum.
The sum of the respondent’s annual income is adjudged to be presently $79,320.00.
          The total income earned by the petitioner is adjudged to be $56,103.00, consisting of wages of $50,603.00 and $5,500.00 derived from oil lease revenue.

Referencing the SSAG, as a guide only, the court orders the respondent to pay to the petitioner interim spousal support in the sum of $700.00 per month commencing effective November 1, 2013, and on the first day of each and every month thereafter until further order of the court.

Given the limitation period has substantially expired before the service of the initial notice of intention, once the clock began to run again it expired within the day.

[238]            The applicable rate of PST varied over the time between 1996 to 2001, but the obligation was always set by s. 5 of the PST Act.
As such, the relevant analysis here is whether there was a retail sale of tangible personal property and whether it is Husky or the contractors that used or consumed the material.
It is clear that one of the parties is responsible for paying PST when tangible personal property is used and consumed.
[241]            Subsection 3(1) of the PST Act sets out the definitions on which the s.5 charging provisions rely.
(ii)        for the purpose of providing a taxable service with the tangible personal property; or
As well, in the Burlington Resources case, BJ Services was not paid if the materials delivered to the well site were not used.
Again, these  facts are distinguishable from the case before me, where Husky paid for the cement whether it was used or not.
[437]            In the end, I find that Burlington Resources is not determinative of the case before me.

[2]     p. 1 of Third Parties’ Written Submissions","Tax Law – Contract for Services – Payment of PST The plaintiff has the onus of proving it is not liable for the payment of PST on a balance of probabilities.
Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit.
The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties.
There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay.
The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced.
In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials.
In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided.
The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky.
On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act.
Husky was the user or consumer of the cement.
The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well.
Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts.
Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property.
Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law.
Husky has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that it is entitled to a refund of the PST it paid on well cementing contracts between itself and third parties.

From his testimony it appears highly unlikely that the offending substance came from gravel used in graveling the back alley.
There were no similar issues anywhere else in town where gravel from the same source was used.
Defence led evidence of the fact that a house was demolished in the area and debris may have been removed through the back alley, suggesting that perhaps this was the cause.
The onus is not on the Defendant to establish an alternative source of the offending substance.
The onus is on the Plaintiff to prove his claim on a balance of probabilities and this involves proving that Mr. Statchuk was responsible for killing their lawn.

APPLICATION
Has identity of the accused been established beyond a reasonable doubt?
This question arises as there was no “dock identification” evidence.
Rather, the Crown relies on the fact that the officer satisfied himself of the identity of the driver by reference to a photograph maintained by a government agency.
Perhaps the suggestion from this is that the Court should have insisted on a voir dire despite the admission, but that is not particularly clear.
This would be admissible pursuant to s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act provided notice has been given in accordance with s. 30(7) of the Act.
The only other evidence of disqualification comes from the statement made by the accused to Constable Chomyn.
However, although the accused admitted knowledge of his licence disqualification, there is no evidence before the Court as to the nature of that disqualification and no basis from which the Court can conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed as opposed to a violation of The Traffic Safety Act. 
[26]            Accordingly, the Crown has failed to establish that the accused was disqualified or prohibited from driving and therefore, the accused is found not guilty.
M.L. Gray, J","The Crown found the accused not guilty.
With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address.
The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary.
Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth.
That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice.
Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present.
All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity.
Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice.
However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel.
Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence.
There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed.","[121, 8, 43, 122, 44, 0, 119, 45, 46, 48, 117, 120]"

Costs of this application.

The Claim contains paragraphs which are not limited to material facts but rather plead matters of evidence and/or are immaterial.
THE IMPUGNED PLEADINGS
            I do not propose to reiterate the well-reasoned submissions of counsel for both the applicants and the respondents, as I have set them forth in my recitation of the respective positions of the parties on the series of impugned pleadings.
I propose to set forth what my views are on each of the paragraphs in question in a summary fashion.
(a)      Paragraphs 14, 15 and 16
            In considering these paragraphs I am in agreement with the submission of the plaintiffs.
Accordingly, as this is my view of the paragraph, I direct that it is to be struck from the statement of claim.
            I am appreciative of the efforts of both Mr. Giroux and Mr. Caroline in addressing this matter orally and through their briefs.
No costs of this motion are to, in any event, be granted to Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. or against Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. Order accordingly.

The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants that included three causes of action: a claim against Xtreme Mining and Banga for wrongful dismissal; a claim for defamation brought against Banga; and for inducing breach of contract against Potash Corp.
The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial.
The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants.
Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment.
The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose.
The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation.
The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media.
HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition.
Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time.
It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial.","[45, 268, 44, 0, 325, 1, 269, 270, 322, 2, 324, 43, 271, 272, 321]"

In Northern Light Arabians v. Sapergia, 2011 SKPC 151 (CanLII), the Court held that an injunction ordering that a fence be built was “beyond the authority of this Court” (para. 39).

This is clearly a remedy this Court has no jurisdiction to grant.
[24]           In summary, the Labuick amended claim can proceed to trial which will be limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees from the Sykes’ property onto the Labuick property and whether these trees invade the Labuick air space.
Whether there are branches overhanging into Labuick’s yard is a triable issue and if Labuick is successful, monetary damages can be awarded.

This would be a misapplication of Morin to the trial process when the trial is by judge alone.
In summary, it is an error of law to subject individual pieces of evidence to the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
To err in such a manner results in an improper and piecemeal consideration of only the evidence that the Crown could prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
However, this error does not arise if the trial judge has merely not explained how each individual piece of evidence was assessed; it arises only if the trial judge subjected individual pieces of evidence to the criminal standard.
In my view, the trial judge erred and applied the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to Mr. Alves’ speed at the time of the accident.
The trial judge stated at para.
The trial judge stated:
When he addressed Mr. Alves directly, the trial judge reiterated that Mr. Alves was fortunate the evidence of his speed had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
62 of the trial judgment he stated:
      I concur.                  “Whitmore J.A.”                                               
                                     Whitmore J.A.","The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed.
The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal.
The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so.
The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony.
The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed.
The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous.
The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial.
The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial.
The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial.
Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.","[283, 280, 391, 0, 288, 275, 3, 277, 276, 390, 278, 286, 7, 8, 273]"

          The court finds further support for this conclusion by comparing the constellation of circumstances in Yates, supra, to the constellation of circumstances in the matter at hand.
In Yates there was a smell of alcohol emanating from the driver's window but there was no admission of drinking.
In the current matter, there is an admission of drinking but no smell of alcohol.
          The ASD demand was reasonably made and, therefore, there was no violation of Mr. Plantje's rights under ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter.
The Crown's appeal must be allowed and a new trial ordered.
b.            Section 24(2)
Exclusion of Evidence
          As a result of the determination on the first issue, the court need not address the issue under s. 24(2) of the Charter.
Conclusion
          The Crown's appeal from acquittal with regard to the charge under s.253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code is allowed.
The acquittal on the charge pursuant to s.253(1)(b) is set aside.
A new trial on the s. 253(1)(b) charge is ordered pursuant to s.686(4)(b)(i) of the Criminal Code.

THOLL","The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard.
The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met.
The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on.
The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning.
The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent.
The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission.
A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time.
It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent.
The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body.
An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol.
Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.","[274, 275, 1, 273, 0, 4, 276, 2, 271, 269, 272, 270, 5, 8, 3, 267, 268, 10, 7, 6, 9, 265, 262, 11, 264]"

ANALYSIS
[7]                        As indicated, this final order for child support is sought to be varied pursuant to s. 10 of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997 in which there must be a material change in circumstances to warrant a variation of the child support provisions.
The preliminary question is therefore whether a voluntary change constitutes a material change.
For a voluntary change to be a material change it must be reasonable in the circumstances.
It appears this application to vary was brought more out of frustration for the respondent’s lack of involvement than as a result of any material change that has taken place.
As a result, I am unable to find that there has been a material change in circumstances as required to vary the existing order, and the petitioner’s application in this regard is dismissed.
                While there was an application brought by each of the parties, the application to vary the child support was the significant matter before me.
The petitioner has been successful in opposing this application and accordingly is entitled to costs which I fix in the amount of $200.00 payable forthwith.
M.T. MEGAW","HELD: The court dismissed both applications.
The respondent’s voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income was insufficient grounds to vary his child support application.

The Arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction, made an unreasonable decision, or committed an otherwise reviewable error of law by misinterpreting sections of The University of Saskatchewan Act, and in particular Section 51.
THE ISSUE
Does the interpretation of s. 51 by the Arbitrator meet the applicable standard of review?
STANDARD OF REVIEW
             The parties disagree on the standard of review to be applied to the Arbitrator’s interpretation of s. 51 of the Act.
The University’s position is that the standard is one of correctness.
The Arbitrator’s decision is protected by a form of privative clause.
The combination of the foregoing points to a standard of deference.
             I find the Arbitrator’s interpretation of sections of the Act are entitled to deference and the standard of review of such interpretations is one of reasonableness.
REASONABLENESS 
             The deferential standard of reasonableness was articulated in Dunsmuir at para.
47 where the following appears:
47 Reasonableness is a deferential standard animated by the principle that underlies the development of the two previous standards of reasonableness: certain questions that come before administrative tribunals do not lend themselves to one specific, particular result.

The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness.
Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly.
Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public.
The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past.
The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout.
To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn.
The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable.","[0, 314, 347, 315, 346, 30, 1, 313, 21, 211, 19, 311, 312, 345, 210, 212, 316, 344, 317]"

III       ANALYSIS
Did the complainant consent to having sex with the accused?
[8]               Consent of the complainant is to be determined by reference to the complainant’s subjective state of mind towards the sexual touching, at the time it occurred.
While the complainant’s testimony is the only source of direct evidence as to her state of mind, credibility must still be assessed in light of all the evidence.
J.R. testified that when the complainant came into her house that night, they had a conversation about their children; the complainant seemed happy and in a good mood, and not particularly intoxicated.
The accused testified that the complainant had been drinking, but was not drunk or blacked out; she had no difficulty understanding him and was able to communicate effectively.
[24]           I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication.
[25]           Having found that the complainant’s conduct raises a reasonable doubt about her non-consent and that she was capable of consenting, I need not consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent.
IV      CONCLUSION
S.L. Metivier, J","There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility.
The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment.
The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent.
The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister.
Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication.
It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent.
The accused was found not guilty.","[94, 92, 7, 0, 35, 90, 91, 89, 34, 36, 37, 88]"

[3]                                      The plaintiff applied by notice of application for the order nisi for judicial sale, with service upon both defendants.
Neither defendant appeared in court.
The plaintiff filed a draft order nisi for judicial sale in support of its application.
It is from this draft order that certain rulings and directions are now provided.
THE APPROPRIATE SELLING OFFICER
The proposed selling officer ought not to be the plaintiff’s own counsel.
THE PAYMENT OF PURCHASE MONIES INTO COURT
                            The draft order sets out the following proposal for disbursing the purchase monies:
There may be accounting issues that the defendants may wish to address and the application to confirm the sale allows for this relief.
The proper forum to disburse funds is the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale process has proved successful.
THE CONFIRMATION OF SALE APPLICATION
                             The application to confirm the sale must be brought in a timely manner.
Form 10-45A refers to that application being made within one month of the sale.
Plaintiff’s counsel may obtain a date for the next court proceeding from the local registrar.
                                           A. R. ROTHERY","The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi.
It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price.
Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000.
If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs.
Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff.
Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application.
All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful.","[78, 22, 0, 91, 21, 1, 79, 90, 2, 77, 20, 38, 57, 23, 19, 76, 3, 58, 80]"

[1]                                      Paragraphs 21, 22 and 23 of my judgment dated December 4, 2014 shall be amended to read as follows:  
It was, accordingly, not necessary for the Crown to prove that the appellant had care and control when he was parked in order to prove the offence.
The appellant submitted that the Crown is not entitled to prove the offence in this fashion, as this argument was not raised at trial.
The Crown thereby signaled that it could prove the offence by proving that the accused drove his vehicle not less than two hours before the administration of the first Intoxilyzer test.
Further, this line of reasoning was not only referred to in the trial judge's reasons (at para. 20), but was fully disclosed at pps. 29-30 of the Crown's factum on this appeal.
In the result, the appellant cannot claim that this argument was raised for the first time on appeal, or that he was surprised or prejudiced in his ability to respond.
There is no suggestion, and no basis to conclude, that the appellant failed to lead relevant evidence as he did not know this issue would be argued.
The appeal on this ground is accordingly dismissed.","The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed.
The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle.
The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c);
the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice;
2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed;
3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard.
The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence.
The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;
 4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively.
The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results.
The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error.
The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law;
5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue.
The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice;
and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness.
The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial.
Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases.
Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong.
The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","[650, 649, 1, 652, 648, 643, 641, 647, 4, 637]"

[3]                        For the reasons that follow in this fiat, I am satisfied that the applicant has not made out a genuine issue for a trial to prove the will in solemn form.
Accordingly, the application must be dismissed.
THE EVIDENCE
[5]                        Although the court was not provided with information as to the date of their marriage, it is evident that Steven and Betty Szwagierczak were married for many years.
The evidence also suggests that this couple was very close.
There is little doubt that he was grief stricken when she eventually passed.
Ms. Walper-Bossence says that she used the exclamation punctuation to emphasize the specific instructions she had received in this regard.
                Ms. Walper-Bossence deposes that she had no hesitation about preparing Mr. Szwagierczak’s will, and had no concerns about his mental capacity.
She acknowledges that he was sad and tearful at the time he gave his instructions, but she did not equate those emotions with a lack of mental capacity.
Ms. Walper-Bossence also noticed a good deal of anger against Debra and Linda. 
ANALYSIS
Had she done so, I would almost certainly have dismissed it. 
CONCLUSION
R. W. ELSON","Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity
After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property.
The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012.
His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will.
It was based on his first will with some revisions.
The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter.
The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters.
The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused.
When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything.
The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him.
The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will.
The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable.
The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions.
When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests.
The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it.
The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","[24, 0, 245, 249, 1, 2, 23, 164, 162, 244, 163, 25, 28, 228, 27, 3, 161, 30]"

May 20, 2015
I                     Introduction
This quickly developed into an intimate relationship.
Ms. J. discovered she was pregnant in early October 2009.
Their child Z.P.J.S. [Z.] was born in June 2010.
Ms. J. is presently 37 and Mr. S. is 43 years of age.
II                     Pleadings and Proceedings
This covers any potential equalization under The Family Property Act.
[194]                             I have considered the above, but conclude the following is appropriate here.
Ms. J. has been predominantly successful in this case.
Ms. J. should have conceded this.
VIII               Conclusion
[196]                             In summary therefore:
Ms. J. shall be entitled to apply for child support, but only after one year;
The parties were found to be in a common-law relationship as set out above;
Mr. S.’s claim for spousal support is dismissed;
Mr. S.’s claim under The Family Property Act is dismissed without any distribution to either party;
Mr. S. is to remove any registrations he has placed against Ms. J.’s real property;
Ms. J. shall receive her costs.
                                                    T.J. KEENE","The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons.
The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness.
The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner.
By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother.
The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times.
To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997.
The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth.
The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent.
The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child.
The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent.
The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home.
The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs.
The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care.
The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future.
The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent.
The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner.
The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties.
The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend.
The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction.
After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses.
The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property.
The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years.
The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.
 The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home.
The value of the home was $360,000.
The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home.
The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties.
After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act.
The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment.
Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","[1236, 7, 1233, 1229, 2, 8, 12, 0, 5, 3, 1223, 1237, 1235, 13, 10, 1231, 11, 1228, 1232, 14, 16, 6, 1218, 1234, 21, 19, 17, 1219, 1211, 22]"

As a result, it does not relate to an error in his decision.
In any event, I have reviewed the relevant part of the transcript.
The trial judge did no more than attempt to keep the trial moving forward and to require Mr. Sheppard to answer the question that he had been asked at that point.
(b)               The trial judge improperly cut off Mr. Sheppard’s cross-examination of Gene Knudsen—I agree with the appeal judge that the trial judge did nothing improper in this regard.
He merely attempted to keep Mr. Sheppard on track in the presentation of his case and discouraged him from asking Mr. Knudsen the same question multiple times.
Further, it is devoid of merit.
Seen in context, the trial judge’s language was innocuous, created no unfairness and revealed no bias.

That is par for the course of appellate litigation, not irreparable harm.
There is no exceptional circumstance making it just that a stay be granted, under Fulton’s secondary test.
The litigation began in 2004, before its conversion to a class proceeding several years later.
There is no imperative of justice that, eight years onward,  would further defer the progress of pretrial disclosure and discovery.
Civil Procedure Rule 1.01 says that the “Object of these Rules” is for “the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every proceeding”.
The Rules assume that at some opportune moment - in my view, before the passage of eight years - the tale should mature from plot development to climax, and the preparation should culminate in a trial.
Conclusion
I dismiss the motion for a stay.
I quantify the costs of the motion at $1,000, to be payable in the cause of the appeal.",", motion denied.
While the province has an arguable appeal, it does not concern a summary judgment motion that would result in the claims being dismissed outright.
If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims.
The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding.
There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved.
The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file.
To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost.","[191, 0, 190, 187, 5, 186, 189, 2, 1, 3, 7, 185, 184, 179, 188, 6, 4, 9]"

J.L.G. PRITCHARD","Civil Procedure – ContemptCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 11-16Municipal Law – Zoning Bylaw – Enforcement
The applicant rural municipality was granted an order in May 2014 by a Queen’s Bench judge that directed the respondent to comply within 60 days with an order of the applicant’s development officer.
That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it.
The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it.
The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order.
After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court.
The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment.
He requested that he receive additional time.
The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order.
At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect.
Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter.
When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it.
The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour.
HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order.
The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued.
The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw.
As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","[208, 1, 2, 0, 211, 204, 3, 207, 209, 5, 4, 6, 8, 11, 202, 199, 7]"

These are findings of fact Turcotte J. could make.

[77]           Turcotte J. also found that “there was no unreasonable delay on Mandy’s part in seeking a retroactive review of Daniel’s child support obligation” (para. 48).
He made this finding while recognizing that she had to have known that Mr. Prescesky had moved.
Given his earlier finding that she had not received disclosure, this finding regarding unreasonable delay is insulated from review in this case (see Hickey).

What is an interim or final order for the purposes of appellate review remains an important issue, but that is not the issue I am addressing on this appeal.","Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal
The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645.
The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334).
An original support order was issued by consent in 2006.
It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable.
In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month.
In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000.
The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year.
One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances.
In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose.
The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him.
The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income.
The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears.
The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them.
In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009.
Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial.
The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct.
The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established.
The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order.
He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.
 HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act.
Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order.
The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income.
Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","[1, 350, 3, 0, 7, 349, 341, 342, 348, 347, 2, 344, 346, 337, 6, 8, 4, 345, 12, 343, 10, 9, 13, 5, 339, 11, 340, 14, 16, 335, 22]"

Here there is a genuine issue.
The genuine issue is whether or not it is misleading to label identical products differently.
Although a genuine issue exists, its resolution does not require a conventional trial….
                Unfortunately (for the plaintiffs) it seems they have simply misconstrued their own pleadings and seized upon what they believed (but as stated above, incorrectly) was an admission that then emerged as the singular plank in their case.
                However, dispute the deflation of this argument, the plaintiffs continued with their defence to summary judgment and with the certification hearing.
I will quickly add at this point that the plaintiffs’ submission that they should receive summary judgment in favour of their claim is clearly without merit.
The within application is clearly pre-certification and not directly tied to the certification hearing.
                Accordingly, I see no reason why the defendants (Loblaws) should not receive their costs for their successful summary judgment application and I so order.
In regards to the certification hearing, I prefer not to order any costs although that application was heard in its entirety.
I do note that the plaintiffs abandoned a major plank in their claim (negligence) after hearing the oral presentation of defence counsel.
However, despite this, I have decided not to order costs for the certification application.","HELD: The court granted summary judgment for the defendants.
It held that it could determine the defendants’ application prior to the plaintiffs’ application for certification.
The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages.
The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence.
There was no genuine issue requiring a trial.
The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them.
It was not necessary to decide the application for certification.","[405, 205, 406, 0, 404, 208, 204, 206, 207, 401, 209, 403]"

Judicial Centre:         Regina
If a judge could tell what is best at the outset, there is no need for an interim order.
Interim orders are designed to minimize conflict between parents and cause the least harm to the child and determination of the cause.
It appears from the foregoing case law, it constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody arrangements pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child.
14     However, Guenther must be read with s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act.
In particular the court notes ss. 6(3).
15     The underlying rationale of the Guenther decision and authorities upon which it relies, is quite practical.
However, it must be taken in proper chronological context.
I do not consider this matter at that stage yet.
It may be the argument of the issues contained in this judgement will move the parties to attempt to bridge these difficulties.
It may be a decision on these issues will go some distance to resolving the short-term issues.
If so, that is in the parties’ best interest.
If not, the mediation suggestion may be raised again.
M.T. MEGAW","Family Law – Custody and Access – Best Interests of ChildFamily Law – Custody and Access – Interim – VariationFamily Law – DivorceFamily Law – Evidence – AffidavitThe parties were in a high-conflict situation and brought five interim applications with various requests.
They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application.
At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready.
The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home.
The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him.
The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared.
The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school.
The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained.
The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist.
The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements. 
There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born.
The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny.
The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time.
The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm.
He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle.
The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance.
The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs.
HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school.
The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner.
The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue.
The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested.
The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause.
The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause.
The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","[176, 175, 352, 178, 351, 349, 350, 353, 179, 1, 2, 170, 0, 3, 347, 171, 169]"

She concedes the spousal support should be discontinued effective January 31, 2016. 
ANALYSIS
                By the time this matter arrived in chambers for argument, some items either had been agreed to or were not being contested as between the parties.
This agreement significantly changed the landscape as to what actually needed to be decided by the court on the application.
Accordingly, it was submitted the court should have no regard for the information on the health difficulties.
This breakdown was proposed by the counsel for the petitioner and accepted by counsel for the respondent.
Should there be an order of costs in this case?
                The respondent has been largely unsuccessful in his application to vary and expunge.
In addition, his failure to assist with the post-secondary expenses was brought to light during this application.
While he accepted his obligation to pay these amounts, it was only done after the petitioner pursued the issue in her responding materials.
                In all of the circumstances, I direct the petitioner shall receive her taxable costs of this application to be paid forthwith and in any event of the cause.
CONCLUSION
M. T. MEGAW","HELD: The application was dismissed.
The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005.
The court assumed that the imputation was correct.
The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012.
From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office.
The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them.
The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","[12, 264, 267, 0, 11, 260, 100, 262, 261, 1, 263, 259, 102, 101, 257, 105, 17]"

[5]               The early portion of his examination-in-chief was primarily focused on the technical aspects of the investigation.

There is no evidence that anyone other than the accused ever used the red computer.
In light of this, the notion that someone other than the accused was responsible is without merit.
The accused was a sophisticated and frequent user of the system.
To suggest that he would be unaware of someone, perhaps a hacker, let’s say, of downloading  material onto his computer is fanciful and defies logic.
In short, all evidence points towards the accused as being guilty of the offences he is being charged with.
Accordingly, I find him guilty as charged.

The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it.
The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage.
A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely.
The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence.

The Honourable Mr. Justice Ottenbreit
In dissent:
The Honourable Mr. Justice Caldwell
1 SCR 455), the trial judge’s misapprehension of it in this way amounts to palpable and overriding error of fact.
The reality of this incident is made clear by the video evidence.
In short, Constable Power had to react almost instantly to the threat he felt Mr. Stonechild posed to his person—there can be no question of the constable’s subjective belief in this regard.
Add to this the dimension of a real threat of HIV and Hepatitis C infection if the aggressor is allowed to carry out an assault and a push-kick response to maintain distance is all the more reasonable in the circumstances.
Pointedly, even with the luxury of months to consider this encounter, no one here has been able to articulate a single response of lesser force that would have been reasonable in the circumstances.
[98]           The defence of self-defence is made out on the proper application of the law to the facts as found by the trial judge.
Given this, an acquittal ought to be entered on the charge of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code.
I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.
Caldwell J.A.","HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge.
The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable.
The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief.
The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do.
The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal.
The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety.
He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole.
The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal.
The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred.
The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force.
The respondent had to react quickly.
The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","[612, 611, 613, 610, 1, 3, 602, 614, 10, 7, 0, 14, 8, 13, 606, 604, 609]"

Third, if the order is enforced, Mr. Lawson may be prejudiced.
This is so because Ms. Rees’s means are very limited and thus there is a real possibility she would not be able repay any “overpayment” of spousal support.
Fourth, Ms. Rees would not be unduly prejudiced by the imposition of a stay as Mr. Lawson is paying ongoing support (spousal and child) of $12,726 per month and Ms. Rees, by her own admission, has taken $25,000 from the line of credit.
Fifth, the imposition of a stay with respect to only the spousal support arrears balances the competing interests at stake in the appeal.

39 that the impact of an order such as this must take into account the impact on the solicitor.
In Vo, Justice Ball indicated at para.
15 that concluding what is just requires a balance between what is fair for the client and what is fair for the lawyer.
                Here Cowessess’ request is not fair to Brabant.
The negative impact would be out of all proportion to the evidence provided on which the request is made.
While a request on one file or a single lawsuit might well be approached differently, here Cowessess seeks to assess six years of general counsel advice on a wide spectrum of issues involving many different matters.
To justify that kind of intrusion to a sole practitioner in a lengthy, extensive and ongoing relationship with a sophisticated client, specific, clearly defined and reliable evidence is required.
In the circumstances here, including the turmoil the Band is currently embroiled in, this is not an appropriate situation in which to order the assessment requested.
It would not be fair nor in the interests of justice.

The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice.
The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files.
The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client.
The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years.
Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid.
The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances.
The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","[240, 242, 1, 2, 239, 0, 243, 5, 3, 241, 235, 7, 238, 232, 237, 234, 6, 8, 233, 231, 9, 236]"

At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order.
A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially.
The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014.
In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent.
They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends.
The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends.
The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him.
HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial.
In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012.
The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","[275, 3, 0, 278, 2, 277, 269, 5, 273, 1, 6, 7, 265, 8, 272, 274, 271, 10, 4, 9, 270, 16]"

INTRODUCTION
In the case before me, good people have done good work on behalf of good children, who absolutely deserve the work that was done.
ANALYSIS
                The Ministry seeks a permanent order with respect to these children.
Such an order removes all parental rights to the children and would come without conditions attached.
The only real alternative on the facts presented here is a long-term order.
This type of order would preserve parental rights and would also leave open the door for a variation application down the road.
It appears, for these children to gain the full benefit of the situation in which they find themselves, they must know their situation is permanent.
They must know their home is their family home and will not be changing now or in the future.
Such further contact will practically be dictated by the children as they age.
                For all of these reasons, I determine a permanent order with respect to these children is the appropriate order to make.
I have determined to make no additional recommendations to the Ministry.
I am mindful of the comments of Dr. Greenough and leave any further recommendations in the care of the Ministry.
CONCLUSION
M. T. MEGAW","HELD: The order was granted.
Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act.
As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands.
Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care.
Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","[12, 297, 0, 300, 11, 152, 294, 31, 1, 296, 13, 153, 151, 295, 293, 154, 291, 292, 155]"

INTRODUCTION
Police attended, arrested and charged him with the offence that he faced at his trial.
ANALYSIS
                The Criminal Code
                Section 267(a) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, the section with which Mr. Drysdale is charged, provides in part as follows:
267 Every one who, in committing an assault,
(a) carries, uses or threatens to use a weapon or an imitation thereof, 
Mr. Drysdale’s actions were not reasonable in the circumstances and do not constitute a lawful protection of himself from any use or threatened use of force against him by Mr. Brown.
Nor was it reasonable for Mr. Drysdale to believe that there was a threat of use of force made against him warranting the measures that Mr. Drysdale took.
                The accused testified but, as pointed out, where his evidence is at odds with that of the Crown’s witnesses, it is on peripheral matters only.
His evidence does not raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt nor does it, in the context of the whole of the evidence and law I have reviewed, leave a reasonable doubt about his guilt.

VERDICT
T. C. ZARZECZNY","Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence
The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code.
The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation.
The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife.
The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle.
The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused.
A knife was also located in the yard.
A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court.
The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers.
The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident.
He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to.
He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out.
The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them.
He said that he did not intend to stab them.
At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not.
The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle.
The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode.
The accused raised the issue of self-defence.
HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.
The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him.
The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires.
The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect.
The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused.
The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer.
The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat.
The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence.
The accused was found guilty as charged.","[10, 0, 208, 211, 207, 19, 127, 126, 206, 125, 205, 204, 11, 9, 128, 1, 129, 203, 202]"

It stated as follows:
Purpose of the Arrangement
The rationale for the Arrangement is that the Shareholders have already sustained a significant loss on their investment as a result of the oppressive acts of former management.
The Arrangement is to be carried out pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Arrangement.
The Legislation
[6]                                      The relevant provisions of the Act within Divisions XIV and XVI dealing with Fundamental Changes and Liquidation and Dissolution respectively are as follows:
That is an approach and potential application that it is open to FCC to consider.
However, the decision as to whether to propose such an approach as an alternative plan of arrangement is a decision for FCC to make.
FCC can, without the need for any order of this court, proceed with additional outreach efforts as it may see fit.
Should FCC decide to simply liquidate and dissolve in the usual manner, without additional outreach efforts, and pay the distribution entitlement of missing shareholders to the Minister of Finance, that option is also available to it. 
                            In the circumstances I dismiss the application for approval of the proposed plan of arrangement.
While the Director, on my request, did participate and oppose the application, I am of the view that the Director should, in all of the circumstances, bear its own costs of this application.
                                             B. SCHERMAN","HELD: The court held that it did not have the power to approve the proposed plan of arrangement.
The court applied the rules of statutory interpretation, specifically the presumption of coherence and overlap, to the provisions of the Act and found that the applicant was using s. 186.1 for a purpose that the legislature did not intend.
The applicant could have proceeded to dissolution under Division XVI.
In s. 210(m) the legislature intended to give the court the ability to order disposition of property of creditors and shareholders but not to deal with a shareholder’s right to distribution on dissolution.","[29, 0, 220, 30, 36, 221, 32, 222, 218, 35, 217, 1, 34, 216, 219]"

ANALYSIS
                The Small Claims Act provides as follows:
A party may appeal a judgment made pursuant to this Act to the Court of Queen’s Bench within 30 days after the date of judgment, or within any further time, not exceeding 150 days, that the Court of Queen’s Bench may allow.
An appeal is commenced by filing with the local registrar of the Court of Queen’s Bench at the judicial centre nearest to the place where the trial was held:
(a) a notice of appeal;
(b) proof of service of the notice of appeal on the opposite party or the party’s lawyer;
(c) a copy of the certificate of judgment; and
I am satisfied the transcript could not be provided within the six month period.
However, this occurred through no fault of the appellant and accordingly the right of appeal should be preserved to allow the matter to be heard on its merits.
In the result, I therefore determine that pursuant to ss. 39(9) of the Act, the transcript may now be filed and this appeal shall proceed to be argued and determined on its merits.
The setting of the appeal date is confirmed.
                There will be no order as to costs in the circumstances.
M. T. MEGAW","HELD: The application was dismissed.
The court held that pursuant to s. 39(9), it ordered that the transcript should be allowed to be filed and the appeal to proceed.
The appellant had done everything required of it pursuant to the Act.
The provisions of s. 39 did not require the appellant to follow up with the local registrar’s office to see if the transcript had been filed.
In a case such as this, s. 39(9) of the Act provides the court with the ability to exercise its discretion to remedy the problem and ensure that justice is achieved where a transcript could not be filed within the six-month period.","[12, 47, 0, 155, 46, 50, 157, 156, 153, 154, 51, 49, 52, 152, 48]"

The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay.
As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered.
The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay.
The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable.","[594, 593, 0, 9, 541, 592, 543, 599, 34, 591]"

(ii)                 her Criminal Record;
(iii)   a discharge summary from the Leipzig Serenity Retreat;

                            In this instance there is some dispute between the parties as to whether they have any beneficial interest in the house they were residing in at the date of separation (which appears to be legally owned by a third party).
They concede that this issue cannot be resolved on an interim motion.
                            The other assets listed in their property statements are mainly household goods and locked-in retirement funds, a portion of which are subject to an exemption claim.
Even if they could be accessed on an interim basis, and there is no evidence that this is the case, doing so would attract significant tax consequences.
                            This is not a situation where the net assets far exceed the amount of the distribution claimed.
In addition, ultimately the distribution may have to be by way of spousal rollover from the locked-in retirement funds as there appear to be no liquid assets available to the husband.
                            For these and other reasons, an order requiring the husband to take out a loan to pay an interim distribution is not justified on the evidence.

It may be inferred that in this case the Chambers judge concluded for all those reasons that the integrity of the judicial decision making process and the interests of justice had not been compromised.
I take her conclusion to be that there would not be a real injustice in the particular case and the SCAN application was not clearly an abuse.
I cannot say based on the applicable standard of review that the Chambers judge improperly exercised her discretion and erred in refusing to grant the stay requested.
That said, it can also not be concluded that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the Director and subsequent SCAN applications respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.

Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act.
The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested.
The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act.
However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.","[0, 229, 228, 3, 227, 226, 225, 222, 4, 2, 10, 1, 6, 221, 218, 7, 220, 5, 223, 217, 9, 214, 8, 224]"

There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation.
The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim.
The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift.
The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven;
there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent.
The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out.
The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim.
The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement.
The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s.
The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32.
The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance.
The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","[140, 137, 139, 1, 2, 138, 136, 134, 3, 4, 133, 9, 5, 132, 7, 8, 6, 128]"

[9]                 Rule 6-13 of The Queen’s Bench Rules provides:
On any application or petition, evidence may be given by affidavit, but the Court may, on the application of either party, order the attendance for cross‑examination of the person making the affidavit.

MLG was unable to explain how cross-examination would assist the Court.

ANALYSIS
1.            Is Mr. Michelin eligible for a conditional sentence order?
                                        The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code in force at the time of these offences do not allow a conditional sentence.
The offence took place on February 25, 2011.
The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code in force at that time (for the period between December 15, 2010 and April 14, 2011) read as follows:
Imposing of conditional sentence
                                        Section 752 provided this definition of ""serious personal injury offence"":
In this Part,
""serious personal injury offence"" means
                                        Section 271, at the time of these offences, provided: 
(e)         to remain within the jurisdiction of the court unless written permission to go outside the jurisdiction is obtained from the court or the probation officer; and
Mr. Michelin, here, did not seek such an exemption.
                                        The Crown also seeks an order pursuant to s. 490.012(1) requiring Mr. Michelin to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, S.C. 2004, c.10.
Mr. Michelin has not suggested that such an order would impact his privacy or liberty or would be grossly disproportionate to the public interest.
As such I make an order in respect of Mr. Michelin under s. 490.012(1) for a period of 20 years. 
          C.L. DAWSON","HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault.
The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats.
The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability.
The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years.
The sentences were to be served concurrently.","[85, 0, 84, 86, 83, 89, 82, 87, 328, 329, 93, 323, 91, 326, 327, 90, 319]"

INTRODUCTION
[1]                    The plaintiff, Canadian National Railway Company (“CN”), has applied to the court seeking orders that the defendants, Clarke Transport and Clarke Transport Inc. (“Clarke”):
Answer certain questions which they refused to answer on discovery;
CN says the undertaking calls for Mr. Swainson himself to say what he meant or did, as opposed to Mr. Thompson saying what Mr. Swainson meant or did.
             Undertaking 35 was to make inquiries of John Thompson and Dave Swainson whether either had inspected the car after loading and, if so, what they recall of the inspection.
The response given stated that, “It is believed that Dave Swainson is the person who inspected and sealed the car” and goes on to provide conclusionary statements.
CN says this is unresponsive since the undertaking called for Clarke to make inquiries of Thompson and Swainson and to advise what their personal responses to the questions were.
CONCLUSION
The balance of CN’s application is dismissed.
COSTS
             I have for the most part dismissed the application by CN for relief.
In the result I award net costs of $1,500.00 to Clarke in any event of the cause.
                                                                                                                           B. SCHERMAN","HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable.
The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue.
This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules.
The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses.
With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled.
Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits.
The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it.
It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so.
The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied.
The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege.
Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature.
The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one.
Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with.
The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","[12, 177, 185, 0, 11, 1, 59, 176, 13, 178, 184, 58, 174, 15, 14, 57, 56]"

The accused had an ability to interact and bond with the people in his life.
A conviction is entered on both counts.
            In summary, convictions were entered on 10 counts and 7 counts were dismissed.
            In closing, I wish to remind all of you that a criminal trial must deal with specific facts on specific allegations.
            This is not a broad-ranging inquiry of abuses which may have occurred in the residential school system or even strictly in the Beauval Indian Residential School during the period 1959 to 1967.
            I wish to remind you that a criminal trial is not a healing process.
[98]                 Victims can only be healed through their own efforts combined with the understanding, cooperation and assistance of their family and friends, supplemented by efforts of the entire local community.
[99]                 As stated many times herein, a criminal trial deals with specific offences and the only question is whether the facts respecting each alleged offence have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CANADA,
It is not that Richer does not know the proper procedure; he has chosen not to follow it as he finds the grievance process frustrating and time consuming.
It may very well be all those things, but it is a process that must be followed as opposed to applying to this Court for a remedy.
The grievance process must be followed by the applicants with a view to eventually bringing a judicial review application to the Federal Court if no favourable responses are obtained by them before then.
             In the event the Court had assumed jurisdiction over this habeas corpus application, the application for habeas corpus would have failed in any event.
On the materials before the Court, the applicants have not established any deprivation of liberty, and the respondent has established that any possible deprivation of liberty is lawful.
Not every constraint on an inmate amounts to a “deprivation of liberty”.  
D.     Conclusion
             For all the reasons as outlined in this decision, the application of the applicants is dismissed with costs to be taxed.
                                                                                                                         M. L. DOVELL","HELD: The Court dismissed the application.
It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction.
The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus.
These remedies were available only through the Federal Court.","[0, 63, 62, 1, 61, 2, 3, 60, 59, 4, 58, 5, 57, 56, 6, 7, 55]"

                                                 ANALYSIS
         What is the standard of review of the Board’s decision to deny reimbursement of Mr. Heilman’s medical marihuana costs?
[5]                 In the earlier decision referred to, Justice McMurtry determined that the applicable standard of review was that of reasonableness.
The parties agree that reasonableness is the appropriate standard of review for this matter as well.
[6]                 Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 (CanLII), [2008]
1 S.C.R. 190 (“Dunsmuir”) established that there are only two standards of review, that of reasonableness and that of correctness.
If the Board has authority to refuse reimbursement for such reasons, there is no improper purpose.
There is no evidence before me that the Board based its decision on the basis that medical marihuana is a controversial moral issue.
          The applicant also asserts that the Board based its decision on irrelevant considerations, in effect, a misconceived perception of the potential political ramification of paying for medical marihuana.
          Again, there is no evidence that the Board made its decision on the basis of considerations such as the potential political consequences of paying for medical marihuana.
On the face of its reasons, the Board denied reimbursement specifically because medical marihuana is potentially unsafe and unproven.
          In the end result, the application is dismissed.
                                                                                                                     P. A. WHITMORE","HELD: The application was dismissed.
With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it.
It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable.
The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective.
In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex;
and 4) that there was no evidence that the board based its decision on irrelevant considerations such as the potential political ramifications of paying for medical marijuana.","[12, 35, 165, 0, 36, 163, 164, 37, 162, 34, 166, 38, 160, 161, 39]"

In his experience, vinyl tile floors will last years and years; problems caused by water infiltration are cumulative over time and may take a long time to show up.
Pooling water in the centre of the basement floor will cause problems evident in areas other than along the walls.
While it is not correct that lack of maintenance was the sole cause of the problems with the flooring, he would attribute 25% of the damage to maintenance issues.
All structural issues must be rectified before any flooring work can be done.
The high humidity in the basement also creates a health hazard, black mold being present in the ceiling.
The tenant submits that damage to the floor has not been shown to be the result of its negligence but is caused by structural defects in the building for which the landlord is responsible.
                                                               DECISION
          There is no issue that at the time the tenant took possession, the vinyl tile floor was waxed, polished, shiny and clean, without any chipped, lifting or loose tiles.
The tenant may set off this judgment against the base monthly rent of $7,700 as specified in clause 8(b) of the lease.
                                                                                                                            G.M. KRAUS","HELD: The Court held that the cause of the damage was high humidity in the building caused by water leaking into it from the roof.
The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor.
The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years.
As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years.
The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed.
The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800.
Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836.
The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500.","[86, 85, 84, 142, 119, 118, 83, 1, 143, 0, 2, 4, 3, 82, 117]"

[1]                 The sole issue presented by this application is whether Mervin C. Phillips and the lawyers with Phillips & Co. should be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff, Helen Theresa Pearce-Ell, because of a conflict of interest.
                                                                  ISSUES
(a)        Did a solicitor-client relationship exist between Laura and Keith Holgate and Phillips & Co.?
(c)        If a solicitor-client relationship existed, did Laura and Keith Holgate waive their ability to raise this issue by reason of delay?
The C.E.D. Western, 4th, Title 16: Barristers and Solicitors, explains the significance of this distinction at p. 279:
§235        The ethical rule respecting confidentiality is distinguished from the evidentiary rule of solicitor-client privilege with respect to oral or documentary communications passing between client and lawyer.
The ethical rule is wider, and applies without regard to the nature or source of the information or whether others may share the knowledge. (footnotes omitted)
          Second, in order to waive the privilege which attaches to confidential information, “the waiver must be made clearly and the client must be fully informed.” (C.E.D. Western, supra, p. 286)
There is no evidence before this Court of an informed waiver.

Hypothetical questions seeking his opinion consequent upon his professional experience could be asked where his and C&amp;L's conduct were in issue.

A party is entitled to discovery of a document if it directly or indirectly enables him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary or may fairly lead to a form of inquiry which may have either consequence. 3)The 'damage claim documents' had been provided.

The evidence contained in the extensive record of the proceedings is relatively uncontradicted and is credible and compelling.
It establishes that the MCIB statistics in this particular case were seriously flawed as a reliable comparison of billing patterns and cardiac patient costs.
But I am not inclined to simply quash the order entirely as the evidence reasonably supports that portion of the order that deals with surcharges.

A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB).
Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence.
The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence.
The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB.
_____
HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed.
The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges.
1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven.
The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision.
The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised.
Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion.
Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues:
The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case.
It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice.
This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee.
The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation.
It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature.
The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'.
To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice.
The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance.
If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue.
There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented.
3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence.
The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data.
The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects.
He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours.
4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76.
The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.
 5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary.","[426, 6, 420, 429, 419, 421, 423, 5, 10, 8]"

The landlord applied for an order for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act.
The 41 month lease required a monthly rental of $500 for the first five months and thereafter semi-annual payments of $5,000.
The tenants had not paid any rent in 1998 nor had they maintained insurance; they installed alternating stalls in the barn in breach of their covenant not to make any alterations or additions to the premises; breached the express and implied covenants to keep the premises in good condition and tenantable repair by their failure to remove and properly dispose of baler twine, to maintain proper weed control or to remove manure buildup in the calf barn.
The tenants admitted the rental payment was due in May but claimed the landlord breached the pre-condition wherein Russell's husband promised to repair the damage caused by a 1995 hail storm.
The claims for repair was far in excess of those provided for in the lease which were the tenant's responsibility._____
HELD: 1)The landlord was entitled to a writ of possession since the tenants were in breach of the covenant to pay rent for more than two calendar months.
2)A trial of the issue was ordered to determine whether the tenants were in breach of covenants in the lease.
The matter should not be decided summarily where there are questions of fact or law.
The hail damage may allow the tenants to claim in damages against the landlord but it could not be construed as a debt due for the purposes of s27 of the Landlord and Tenant Act.
The remaining alleged breaches could not be determined summarily.

13        I agree with the trial judge that actus reus in count #1 has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, although not for the reasons stated by the trial judge.
The fact that Greer suffered a serious injury at work is evidence that the appellant did not ensure his safety and health as required.
At para.
Justice Sherstobitoff described with approval the trial judge’s analysis on that point:
These factors include also the fact that Mr. Cruse was not told to do anything related to entering a receiving pit, and the fact that Mr. Cruse was told to perform a task that did not involve entering a receiving pit.
The factors include as well the fact that there was no reason for Mr. Charlie to think that Mr. Cruse would consider entering the receiving pit.
                            Accordingly, the defence of due diligence would apply with respect to each count if the actus reus had been established with respect to it.

                                                G.M. CURRIE","HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee.
The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies.
The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner.
The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit.
The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him.
The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures.
The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown.
The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally.
The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business.
The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety.
The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task.
The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2.
The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4.
The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain.
The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved.
The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","[43, 45, 279, 44, 280, 275, 49, 42, 277, 0, 48, 276, 1, 274]"

The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights.
The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving.
The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft.
He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech.
She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol.
When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath.
He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still.
She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance.
When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five.
He arrested her and made the breath demand.
The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things.
With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested.
At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it.
A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received.
The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample.
The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer.
The officer called the number but received an after-hours message.
He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message.
She then provided her first breath sample.
The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.
 HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach.
The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired;
and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b).
The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","[340, 3, 1, 2, 338, 7, 341, 339, 336, 9, 337, 335, 4, 5, 13, 328, 8, 6, 14]"

He presented as a qualified technician who attended on the accused to administer the breath tests.
The result of the tests are contained in the Certificate of Qualified Technician (Exhibit P-1).

The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it;
and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained.
However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained.
The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately.

[3]               The defence served and filed a Charter notice alleging several breaches.
[4]               Counsel agreed that all evidence would be heard on the voir dire and all admissible evidence  on the voir dire would apply to the trial proper.
The defence did not call any evidence on the voir dire or during the trial proper.
[5]               The defence agreed that the only Charter issue being pursued was a breach of Section 8.
Ms. Smith gave no evidence with respect to the driving actions of Ms. Babich.
Constable Clements received a call from dispatch about a possible impaired driver and attended very quickly to the Simcoe Street address as she was the in the area.
There was no vehicle outside and when she knocked on the door the occupant answered.
[38]           The Crown did not really argue the impaired driving charge and I find there was little if any evidence to support the charge.
Therefore count two with respect to the impaired driving I find Ms. Babich not guilty as well.
M. Gordon","HELD: The Charter application was granted.
The accused was found not guilty.
The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights had been breached.
After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view.
The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence.
Regarding the impaired driving charge, the accused was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence.","[0, 11, 186, 185, 187, 10, 15, 8, 182, 14, 17, 184, 18, 16, 183]"

As such, I am not convinced that it is appropriate to grant an injunction in these circumstances and Dr. Graham’s request in this regard is dismissed.
CONCLUSION
          D.E. LABACH","HELD: The action was allowed.
The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000.
The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced.
It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000.
The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial.
She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff.
As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants.
The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages.","[12, 0, 1289, 1285, 11, 1, 1280, 188, 1283, 1284, 186, 1282, 1278, 189, 1274, 1270, 193, 1277]"

I.         INTRODUCTION
[1]               WBA was born on October 6, 2015.
His mother is CB, now 19 years of age, and his father is JA, now 16 years of age.
[2]               This infant was technically apprehended at birth by the Minister of Social Services, but the Minister did not proceed with the application, and CB was allowed to take the baby home with her.
[3]               The concerns expressed in the maternity alert from Rosetown were:  
    CB had diminished cognitive abilities, as she suffers from FASD, and as a result she has challenges around understanding and retaining information, despite presenting as though this is not the case;
    CB has a history of being involved in a physically abusive domestic relationship;
[46]           As I stated above, I am not satisfied that the care these young parents could as of today provide for this child would result in WBA not being in need of protection.
(a) Both parents will have liberal access to WBA, as arranged by the Minister’s employees;
(b) Both parents will participate in any anger management or parenting programming as directed by the Minister’s employees; and
(c) Both parents will co-operate in any parenting assessment done by the Minister’s employees, if such an assessment is undertaken during the course of this order.

J.A.’s mother was found to be a person of sufficient interest under s. 23 of the Act.
The court ordered that the child should be placed in the custody of J.A.’s mother as a person of sufficient interest for a period of four months pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act.
The child’s parents should have adequate access to build their relationship with him and to allow them, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to eventually care for their child.","[16, 15, 195, 18, 194, 20, 193, 192, 0, 3, 21, 17, 22, 187]"

It did not allow the equitable principles of unjust enrichment and constructive trust to operate to create a proprietary interest.

The warrant authorized obtaining the search history from this computer.
There are software tools available that would do solely that.
Those tools were not used here.
They could have obtained a further warrant.
It did not occur that this should take place.
They did have authority to look at the internet history.
                While the nature of the offence would suggest society demands a complete adjudication on the merits, the nature of the search here suggests otherwise.
It is not open season on whatever is found by the authorities.
There are limits as to what will be acceptable.
After the fact justification is not something the court will support in these circumstances.
                The police were looking for internet history.
While not explained well in the evidence, the temporary internet files are created as a result of visits on the internet.

The police had no authority to search the computer generally.
They were only authorized to look at the Internet history.
The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right.

BACKGROUND
[4]                        For the reasons that follow, I find that it is appropriate to order a Voice of the Child report be prepared regarding V. 
DISCUSSION
Variation 
[6]                        X. disagrees with R. in all respects, thus the affidavits are conflicting in nature, to put it mildly.
It is to be borne through resources provided to the program aside from the parents.
                R. and X. are prohibited from discussing the Voice of the Child report process with V. and shall not influence, coach, sway or prompt V. towards any particular views or statements for the purposes of the Voice of the Child report.
V. must be left to say what he feels is important, unimpeded by the desires of either parent.
                This application is therefore to be adjourned sine die returnable not sooner than 14 days after the Voice of the Child report has been received by all parties.
ISSUANCE OF THE JUDGMENT
I attach the copy of the judgment with notations that is appropriately issued at this time and I direct its issuance in that form.
COSTS
D.J. BROWN","Family Law – Custody and Access – VariationFamily Law – Custody and Access – Voices of the Children Report
In 2012, after a trial, it was determined that the child should be parented on a shared basis with a one-week rotation between parents.
An order was never issued and therefore, no judgment was taken out.
The applicant now applied to have a formal judgment issued, and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence.
Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report.
The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time.
The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour.
The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure.
She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy.
HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report.
It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report.
There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time.
The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old.
He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court.
The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program.
The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report.
The application was adjourned sine die returnable not sooner than 14 days after the report was received by all parties.

Another way of putting the test is that the claim has no reasonable prospect of success.
Where a reasonable prospect of success exists, the matter should be allowed to proceed to trial: see, generally, Syl Apps Secure Treatment Centre v. B.D., 2007 SCC 38 (CanLII), [2007]
3 S.C.R.83; Odhavji Estate; Hunt; Attorney General of Canada v. Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, 1980 CanLII 21 (SCC), [1980]
19 The power to strike out claims that have no reasonable prospect of success is a valuable housekeeping measure essential to effective and fair litigation.
It unclutters the proceedings, weeding out the hopeless claims and ensuring that those that have some chance of success go on to trial.
[7]                        On an application to strike, the facts set forth in the Statement of Claim are considered to be true unless manifestly incapable of proof.
It is incumbent on the plaintiff to clearly plead the facts upon which he relies in making his claim.

In my view, such an order is justified based on the considerations specified in Rule 4-24. 
VII.            CONCLUSION
                For the foregoing reasons, it is ordered as follows:
The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order dated January 9, 2014, as amended by the order dated October 30, 2014 [Order], is dismissed.
                3.      Ṣekerbank shall pay the sum of $40,000 into court within 30 days of the date of this order as security for costs, pursuant to Rule 3-34 of The Queen’s Bench Rules.
Alternatifbank A.S. shall be added as a plaintiff, and the Statement of Claim may be amended in the manner specified in the draft filed.
                Given that there has been mixed success on these related applications, there shall be no order as to costs.","Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8
The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim.
ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants.
The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs.
Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt.
ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act.
The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied.
Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff.
The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014.
The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA.
The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim.
If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000.
HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted.
The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed.
The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs.
The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice.
The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay.
The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.
 The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim.
The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order.
The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","[352, 353, 349, 346, 2, 5, 341, 1, 348, 9, 3, 345, 0, 347, 4, 8, 6, 12, 10, 351, 344]"

Instead, HAL’s proposed grounds of appeal relate to the way in which the majority weighed certain factors, and applied the legal standard.
Such proposed grounds of appeal, according to the leading authorities, are thus mixed questions, not pure questions of law.
                This also applies to HAL’s argument that the majority erred in law by failing to consider the effect of the termination clause of the contract.
In my view, the majority’s language is clear, throughout its reasons, that it considered the whole of the contract.
This must be taken as including the termination clause.
Furthermore, the issue of the termination clause was not relevant to the central issue of whether SecurTek was obligated by the IDSL or MIDSL to purchase a certain number of licences from HAL.
                Accordingly, HAL’s proposed grounds of appeal do not raise a pure issue of law.
Even if I had found that HAL and SecurTek had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, HAL’s application for leave to appeal would have to be dismissed on that basis.
CONCLUSION
                For the foregoing reasons, HAL’s application is dismissed.
SecurTek is entitled to the costs of this application.
J.D. KALMAKOFF","HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed.
The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair.
The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration.
Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","[236, 235, 232, 233, 237, 2, 1, 0, 230, 229, 228, 234, 3, 227, 231, 5, 226]"

A.        Introduction
[2]                                       The function of the Court at this time is to sentence Normand Lavoie.
That sentence must be just and fair and be consistent with previous judicial decisions in this jurisdiction, if at all possible.
Unfortunately, for the families sentencing is not a perfect science but the best the law has to offer.
N.        Conclusion
                            Mr. Lavoie, would you please stand.
                            Pursuant to s. 259(22) of the Criminal Code, you are prohibited from operating a motor vehicle on any street, road or highway or other public place for a period of five years following your release from imprisonment.
                            There shall be a ten‑year mandatory firearm prohibition order pursuant to s. 109 of the Criminal Code.
                            As these charges are secondary designated offences, there shall be an order pursuant to s. 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily substances from yourself for the purpose of DNA analysis.
                                                       M.L. Dovell","The accused was found guilty of three counts of dangerous driving causing death, contrary to s. 249(4) of the Criminal Code, and one count of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, contrary to s. 249(3) of the Code.
During his employment as professional truck driver, the accused had driven into construction zone on highway and hit another vehicle that had been stopped.
The three teenage occupants of the vehicle were killed and flag person was severely injured as result of the collision.
The accused was sure that he had not been asleep at the time of the accident but felt that he had not been paying attention.
He had not noticed any of the signs posted at 100-metre intervals after the start of the construction zone 1.6 km south of the accident.
The accused was 41 years of age.
He had obtained his A-1 driver’s licence in 2009 and had clean driving abstract.
He was married and had three children.
He had recently been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea.
He expressed remorse to the victim’s families and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.|
HELD: The accused was sentenced to three years in imprisonment on the first count and three years concurrent for the second and third counts, and one year concurrent to the other counts on the fourth count.
He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment.
The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person.
The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families.
The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone.
The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse.
He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record.
The accused was at low risk to re-offend.","[1, 2, 3, 367, 0, 8, 5, 9, 6, 4, 356, 10, 7, 355, 11, 362, 15, 16, 364, 361, 354]"

Subject to subrule (3), there is a presumption that a successful party is entitled to the costs of a family law proceeding or a step in a family law proceeding.
[419]                  While a successful party is presumptively entitled to the same in a family law proceeding, costs remain in the discretion of the court.
Success in this case has been mixed.
In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs.
D.C. CHOW","HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband.
The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father.
It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other.
The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him.
There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse.
Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy.
2) The husband had professional corporation.
His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received.
His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings.
Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability.
The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses.
It was not appropriate to impute income to her.
She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada.
Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order.
There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support.
3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon.
The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife.
Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names.
The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations.
The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home.
4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support.
The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career.
The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support.
However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines.
Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate.
The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support.
5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","[1520, 1519, 1517, 1192, 1139, 9, 1196, 1522, 1193, 1523, 1521, 3, 14, 24, 5, 8, 1144]"

The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy.
The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided.
Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent.
It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary.
The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths.
Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant.
There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation.
HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings.
The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus.
It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","[271, 270, 272, 2, 268, 267, 266, 269, 273, 1, 264, 4, 0, 5, 265]"

Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan
Citation: R v P.R., 2018 SKCA 27
Appellant 
I emphasize the Court’s recognition and denunciation of this extremely serious offence.
I reinforce that offences of this nature generally merit a custodial sentence to hold the offender accountable and to provide meaningful consequences for the criminal conduct.
Courts cannot lose sight of the fact that sentencing youth offenders pursuant to the YCJA is a contextualized process and mandates a unique lens in which to assess the fitness of a sentence.
Therefore, I conclude the objectives and principles of the YCJA are best fulfilled by a sentence of 12 months of probation.
I would invite counsel to file written submissions as to the appropriate conditions within the two weeks from the date of this judgment.
In the result, the conviction appeal is dismissed.
Leave to appeal the sentence is granted and the 18-month custody and supervision order is varied to a probationary term of 12 months. 
Richards C.J.S.
Schwann J.A. ","HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed.
The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation.
The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced.
The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one.
She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence.
The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony; 
2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference.
He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA.
The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016.
Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice.
To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society.
The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation.","[360, 358, 1, 366, 361, 0, 2, 355, 354, 3, 4, 359, 357, 364]"

[97]           In conclusion, I am satisfied the trial judge was operating under a correct understanding of the law.
He took a measured approach with regard to the need for a Vetrovec warning in the circumstances and he carefully solicited input from both Crown and defence counsel.
He was cognizant that highlighting corroborative evidence in the jury charge could be potentially prejudicial to the accused.
The trial judge’s decision as to the Vectrovec warning is discretionary in nature and entitled to appellate deference.
It only warrants appellate intervention if the trial judge misdirected himself, or if his decision was so clearly wrong so as to amount to an injustice.
Taken as a whole, I am satisfied that the trial judge properly instructed himself and that there was a clear foundation for how he exercised his discretion.

Caldwell J.A. ","Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury
The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury.
He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim.
The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well.
During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence.
The defence counsel then withdrew his application.
The victim had been a friend of the appellant.
According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard.
The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash.
S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other.
She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life.
The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun.
As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun.
The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field.
Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered.
The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013.
She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident.
At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was.
When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant.
S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident.
The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons.
The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery.
The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck.
The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns.
S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times.
She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems.
The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend.
Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times.
On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later.
The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident.
In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning.
It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel.
The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury.
The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury.
The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","[534, 1, 540, 538, 3, 531, 533, 7, 539, 527, 535, 0, 537, 532, 10, 13, 536, 6, 530, 4, 2, 8, 12, 9, 11, 528, 5]"

ISSUES
Was There any Agreement Respecting the Sale and Purchase of Land?
The Burden of Proof
[8]                        As the plaintiff, Mr. Ziola must prove on a balance of probabilities that a contract existed between him and Mr. Petrie and that the formalities of the Statute of Frauds have been satisfied.
The Essential Elements of Contract Formation
[9]                        Both parties agree that the requirement of writing under the Statute of Frauds is an additional requirement to the usual essential elements of a valid contract.
Thirdly, did the parties make their agreement conditional upon, and subject to, execution of a formal document.
                Missing from Justice Wilkinson’s list in this action is a consensus ad idem manifest to a reasonable observer.
As stated earlier in this judgment, even if the requirement of writing was established, an otherwise unenforceable contract cannot be made enforceable only because it is in writing rather than oral.
Conclusion
                Mr. Ziola has not established on a balance of probabilities that he and Mr. Petrie were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale respecting the Subject Quarters.
His action is dismissed.

The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow.
The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation.
Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present.
The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action.
The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed.
The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter).
In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters).
The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program.
He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced.
After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders.
They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals.
The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters.
The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000.
At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000.
The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”.
He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters.
The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters.
He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers.
The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters.
The defendant told him to “hold off”.
The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters.
The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters.
Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid.
The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.
 HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed.
He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters.
The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract.
In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties.
The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding.
Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things;
and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","[13, 0, 268, 270, 37, 36, 269, 41, 266, 38, 264, 267, 40, 263, 39]"

[51]           In that regard, I conclude Mr. Hayter’s poor conduct of his own defence favours intervention in this matter.
Throughout the trial, it appears Mr. Hayter had a difficult time hearing or understanding what was going on.

It contains examples of Mr. Hayter making mistakes in carriage of his defence.
Unlike the accused in R v Rak, I cannot safely characterise his self-advocacy as adroit or capable.
I cannot say he handled his cross-examinations effectively or that he showed a clear ability to understand the documentary evidence.
As such, I conclude the denial of the mid-trial adjournment “could have played a significant role in the legal validity of the verdict or rendered the trial unfair, in reality or in appearance” (R v Khan at para 66).

It logically follows that the protection of s. 2 of the LCRA pertains to all costs which are part of the outstanding mortgage amount.
In this case, the pro rata calculation of the non‑purchase money mortgage is 8% of the total outstanding mortgage amount.
RBC is entitled to judgment against Partridge for 8% of the solicitor‑client costs, condominium fees and property management charges.
                            It is hereby ordered that RBC is granted judgment against Partridge in an amount calculated as:
(a)      the sum of $9,901.23 with interest from November 1, 2017, to the date of judgment at the rate of 2.79% per annum, representing the deficiency of principal and interest owed under the mortgage;
(b)      8% of solicitor‑client costs assessed at $4,500.00 and 8% of disbursements and applicable taxes;
(c)      8% of the condominium fees of $2,528.90 paid by RBC; and
(d)      8% of the property management charges of $1,461.92 paid by RBC.

Rothery","Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The plaintiff bank applied by notice of application for a deficiency judgment against the defendant pertaining to the non-purchase money portion of the outstanding indebtedness to the plaintiff pursuant to her mortgage and to some other costs related to the mortgage.
The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases.
The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale.
The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata.
As at November 1, 2017, the principal and interest owing on the non-purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,250.
The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment.
It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage.
The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro rata calculation for the nonpurchase portion of the mortgage, that is, 8 percent of the total costs incurred.

                            Thus, non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act, RSC 1985, c I‑5, may well be an arguable defence in this case.
Whether there has actually been non-compliance is a matter for the trial judge to decide.
                            In short, I find that the delay has not caused Sollows irreparable harm, and Key has demonstrated an arguable defence to Sollows’ claim.
This is an appropriate situation to exercise the judicial discretion provided by Rule 10-13 and set aside Sollows’ default judgment.
Key is granted leave to serve and file its Statement of Defence, in the form of the draft filed July 19, 2018.
                            Counsel for Key seeks costs of this application in any event of the cause, on the basis that the default judgment was set aside ex debito justitiae.
While costs are often granted in such a case, upon considering the entire set of circumstances that led to this application, Sollows should not have costs awarded against it for what was actually a result of electoral turmoil within Key’s own governance.
                            The application is granted.

It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action.

839,"Editor's Note: Addendum released August 6, 1997.
Text of addendum appended to original judgment.
On August 25, 1992, Cheryl was delivered of her baby by caesarian section, following what has been described as an uneventful and even excellent pregnancy.
Following initial examination and diagnosis, given the seriousness of the problem, Dr. Urbanski called in Dr. Colin Eric Clark (""Dr. Clark"") and Dr. A. Zaidan (""Dr. Zaidan"") to assist him.
The evidence does not support the suggestion that in this case, a D & C would have cured the hemorrhage, originating as it did from the lower cervix.
As he stated the laparoscopy is the definitive test, not the ultrasound.          Contrary to the allegations of Cheryl, Dr. Urbanski stated that he did not suture the cervix shut.
In that, his testimony is supported by that of Dr. Clark.
The plaintiff has failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her.
The plaintiff has failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum hemorrhage experienced by her on September 29, 1992 and subsequently, was retained products of conception.
Beard J. stated at p. 32, para. 24.
The quote following the paragraph remains the same.          In addition, the following paragraph is added after the quote on p. 4:          The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the issue of the admissibility of the nurse's notes ((1995), 1994 CanLII 16696 (MB CA), 97 Man. R. (2d) 185).                                                        J.","A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis.
She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy.
HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs.
1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her.
The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics.
2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part.
The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix.
Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted.
The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage.
ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4:

The Board is interpreting s. 37 for the purposes of labour law alone.
We cannot say that the lesser test set by it is patently unreasonable in context.
       We are of the view that this is the first issue which should have been addressed by the chamber judge.
The review of the evidence, given this answer, should have been conducted on the definition put forward by the Board, not on the more restrictive definition of the chamber judge.
       In summary we are of the view that the Board's findings of fact were unimpeachable, that its construction of s. 37 was not patently unreasonable, and that its conclusion ought not therefore to have been interfered with.
       We make it clear that in the circumstances, the other issues addressed in the judgment of the chamber judge and sought to be raised in this appeal need not be determined by this Court at this time and we expressly do not comment on them.
       In the end result, the appeal is allowed with costs on double Column V except, of course, to the Labour Relations Board which has not asked for costs.","Appeal from an order aside, as premature, an order of the Labour Relations Board directing that a vote be held to determine which of two unions should represent the employees of the Health Centre.

HELD: It is within the purview of the Board to interpret s.37 and on an application to quash, the first question to be asked by the reviewing court is whether the interpretation is patently unreasonable.
To jump immediately to an analysis of the facts premised on a different interpretation does not serve.
The interpretation of the board of s.37 was not patently unreasonable.
It does not apply to other areas of the law, such as financing, conveyance of property or insurance, where a more precise and predictable delineation may be appropriate.

841,"All other claims are barred under s. 3(j) within six years after the cause of action arose unless they are saved by the common law doctrine of discoverability.
         In [P.G.], supra, Ball J. reviewed the decisions relied on by the plaintiff and the Crown in support of their respective arguments as to whether or not the doctrine of discoverability applies to the claims advanced by the plaintiffs.
         Ball J. came to the conclusion that all of the limitation periods in The Limitation of Actions Act were subject to discoverability.
Discoverability is a common law rule of interpretation applied by courts in construing statutory limitation provisions.
         In dealing with the limitation and laches arguments advanced by the Crown, Haines J. made the following comments:
This action was commenced long past the proscription dates that would apply to the claims arising from the allegations of negligence, assault and battery.
To the extent any such claims may be saved by the discoverability rule, there will have to be an independent inquiry conducted of each member of the class to determine if they took action within a reasonable time once  they were aware of the harm and its likely cause.
                                                          CONCLUSION
         The application is therefore dismissed.
Crown counsel advised that the Crown is not seeking an order for costs.","Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act.
The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment.
They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances.
The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues.
It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion.
It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years.
Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues.
A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis.
Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision.
The Crown did not seek costs.","[497, 470, 356, 496, 359, 467, 358, 468, 465, 361]"

[2]            Mr. Brick registered a caveat against the mineral title of the subject land on November 3, 1972.
ISC said that, absent the consent of the respondents, it was not prepared to take any action.
Mr. Brick and 618820 then brought this application seeking a declaration that the caveat was wrongfully removed by the Registrar, an order that the caveat be reinstated retroactively and costs.
                                                 ANALYSIS
Should the caveat be reinstated retroactively by order of the Court?
[27]           It would simply not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief.

This is without prejudice to Mr. Dorosh to bring an application to vary with respect to the same relief if supported by the appropriate financial disclosure and documentation.
There are no costs awarded.
[7]            What remains to be determined upon this application are the matters of custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support.
Child Support and Arrears
[20]           In his application Mr. Dorosh states his request on the basis that the parties share custody of Letitia, that is, that Letitia is residing with her father at least 40% of the time.
In Mr. Dorosh’s supporting affidavit he fails to provide the Court with any evidence that Letitia is indeed residing with him or under his direct supervision and control.
There is the mere statement that there is a “50-50 living arrangement from the beginning of the proceedings.”
Nor does Mr. Dorosh provide any evidence nor explanation at to why he has failed to pay child support which creates the present arrears.
The after tax effect should equate to the former level of real support.
[39]           Ms. Antonowitsch is entitled to her taxable costs against Mr. Dorosh.","FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support.
HELD: 1)
On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody.
The child is now 15 years old.
The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting.
The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests.
The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.
 2) The access was varied in January 2004.
Nothing has changed to warrant a variation.
3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time.
There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears.
The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date.
In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund.
If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4)
The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working.
The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control.
The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use.
The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review.
The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","[67, 0, 120, 302, 301, 66, 1, 2, 124, 122, 65, 125, 123]"

                                                                                                                            PETITIONER

A parent is not permitted to try and gain an advantage by virtue of removing a child from that jurisdiction.
In my view, the conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate.
This Court’s role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.
49)              This is not a situation where the Saskatchewan Court has any concern that the judicial system in the state of habitual residence will not operate fairly.
I have no hesitation in extending to the Connecticut Superior Court full faith and credit that they will address the issue of custody of Joshua with the best interests of the child as its primary focus.
Order
50)              Given the time of year, the child’s tender years, and Ms. Yamchuk’s limited resources, I will allow for a modest period of time for the return to be accomplished.
51)              Therefore, I direct the respondent, Renae Yamchuk, previously known as Renae Jones, to return the child, Joshua Jones, born April 10, 2003, to the State of Connecticut, United States of America.
Such return is to be accomplished by January 8, 2006.
                                                                                                    R. S. Smith   ","FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003.
They are married and the family home is in Connecticut.
The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan.
The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut.
HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.
 1) The child was born in Canada.
He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003.
In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit.
It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child.
In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner.
Reconciliation was attempted.
The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned.
The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada.
For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence.
At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles.
The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy.
Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut.
The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home.
2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut.
He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody.
The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody.
The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate.
Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut.
This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.","[3, 1, 4, 0, 245, 246, 240, 239, 244, 6, 237, 242, 2, 243, 7, 235, 241]"

On January 20, 2007, plaintiffs’ counsel filed an amended statement of claim which added the Government of Saskatchewan (herein “Saskatchewan”) as a second defendant.
Saskatchewan then applied for an order disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim.
                                       THE PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIM
Paragraph 133 states:
In the event that the Defendants attempt to rely upon the Public Officers Protection Act (now repealed) then the Plaintiffs plead s. 2(1)(b) of that Act and ask this Honourable Court to extend the time for commencing this action on a nunc pro tunc basis.
Statutory Limitation Periods
[15]           Accepting the allegations in the plaintiffs’ pleadings as true for the purposes of this motion, The Limitations Act contains a number of provisions which are prima facie relevant.
[28]           If the plaintiffs wish to apply on proper notice and with supporting evidence for orders determining that their claims are not statute barred, or that their claims should be allowed to proceed, they may do so.
If they do not, they may spend considerable time and money attempting to litigate statute barred claims.
(See Popowich  v Saskatchewan 2001 SKQB 148 (CanLII); [2001]
                                              CONCLUSION
This application is based on the proposition that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applies to the plaintiffs’ amended claim.
In either case, the applications must satisfy the applicable legislation and the Rules of Court.
                                                                                                         D.P. Ball","FIAT: The plaintiffs are former students of a school at Ile a La Crosse, Saskatchewan.
They commenced this proposed class action against the Attorney General of Canada (the Government) in December 2005.
In January 2007 the plaintiffs' counsel filed an amended statement of claim which added the Government of Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan) as a second defendant.
Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim.
The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents.
HELD: 1) This application is based on the proposition that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applies to the plaintiffs' amended claim.
However, s. 20 does not apply because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant.
Section 19 of The Limitations Act applies to the original and the amended claims.
The application is dismissed.
2) Accepting the pleadings as true, a number of the plaintiffs' claims are prima facie statute-barred.
The plaintiff may choose to apply for orders determining that no time limitation period applies or allowing the claims to be brought.
Alternatively, the defendants may apply for orders determining that some or all of the claims are statute-barred.
In either case, the applications must satisfy the applicable legislation and the Rules of Court.","[0, 16, 144, 135, 78, 17, 134, 1, 15, 136, 77, 132, 43, 131, 143, 44]"

            Gail Rousseau is a joint owner of the property and should have been included as a plaintiff at the time the original action was commenced.
The fact she was not appears to have arisen from inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice made at the time.
Her joinder as a party in this fact situation is contemplated by the Rules (Rule 38(1)) and normally would not be contested.
The material filed indicates the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendments was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued, and arises out of the same occurrence.
1 W.W.R. 361 (Alta. Q.B.) at 373 et seq.).
Allowing the amendments with respect to Gail Rousseau also makes it appropriate to join Kory (Rousseau) Dutton as a party.
            The amendments to the claim joining Gail Rousseau and Kory (Rousseau) Dutton as parties to the action, and the amendments set out in paras. 10, 11 and 12 of the amended statement of claim are allowed.
            The costs of this application are costs in the cause.
            Order accordingly.","FIAT. It was held in an earlier fiat in June that the addition of the two proposed plaintiffs asserted new causes of action and amendments to the statement of claim could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act.
The defendant resisted the joinder of the new plaintiffs and amendments on the basis of undue delay and actual prejudice.
The statement of claim alleged nuisance, and in the alternative, negligence against the City with respect to the design, construction and maintenance of the sewer system causing his basement to flood.
The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time.
Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied.
The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes.
HELD: The amendments were allowed.
1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage.
The facts were uncertain.
It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced.
If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period.
2)Inexcusable delay was not established.
3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice.
If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction.
No evidence had been lost.
The basement was available for inspection.
It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants.
4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments.
The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice.
It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff.
It appeared that the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendment was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued and arose out of the same occurrence.

                                  FOR ACCESS TO AN EXHIBIT FILED WITH 
                                                 THE PROVINCIAL COURT

However, the court must be concerned that no harm befalls innocent parties.
This CD-ROM will invariably hold conversations made by innocent parties.
[8]                    Had the trial proceeded, the journalists would have heard the contents of the CD-ROM in open court and would have been able to report on what they heard.
In granting access to the exhibit, the court should be mindful of possible harm to others.
Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General  and playing the original CD-ROM balances those interests.
[9]                    I therefore declare that the applicant is granted access to the CD-ROM entered as an exhibit in the Jones sentencing.
The respondent is ordered to make available to the applicant, during regular business hours, the said exhibit and the requisite recording devices to utilize the CD-ROM.
The applicant is entitled to make its own notes on what it hears and sees.
             Counsel are entitled to return the matter to me for further directions.","FIAT. Saskatoon's daily newspaper applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing in the matter of R. v. Glen Ivor Jones on May 14, 2002.
The journalists had no prior opportunity to hear its contents because Jones entered a guilty plea.
The application was not opposed.
The applicant sought an order for mandamus or a declaration.
HELD: The presumption is in favour of public access to court records and the burden to contrary proof lies with the person who would deny access.
This right is tempered by other factors (see R. v. SJS).
Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General and playing the CD ROM and making their own notes balances the interests of innocent parties whose conversations were recorded.","[50, 0, 1, 49, 2, 3, 48, 47, 46, 5, 45, 4, 6, 43, 44, 7, 42]"

Does count 1 of the indictment offend the “single transaction rule”?
            In light of all of these considerations, I have concluded that there has not been unreasonable delay in bringing this matter to trial.
This application to quash the proceedings is dismissed.
            The application to quash count #1 on the basis that it charges more than one transaction contrary to s. 581 of the Code is dismissed.
            The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made by Klebuc J. in the Schafer trial is allowed in part as follows:
            The Crown’s proceeding in relation to the particular charged in subpara.
(j) of count #1 regarding the alleged representation to investors that 30 percent of their investment would be invested in GICs is stayed on the ground that to allow the Crown to now proceed against this accused with that allegation would constitute abuse of process.
            I note that the Crown has already advised the Court that it will not be proceeding with either subpara. (c) or (d) of count #1.
            The application for stay of proceeding on the ground of delay is dismissed.","FIAT. The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial.
He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith.
HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed.
The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests.
The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time.
2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended.
The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs.
To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process.
The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d).
2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay.
There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.","[348, 346, 344, 349, 340, 343, 341, 1, 7, 347, 0, 11]"

The applicant also sought in the alternative a variation in the access she has to Jacob at this point in time.
The respondent resisted the applicant‘s request for overnight access on the basis that in his opinion the applicant‘s emotional health makes it difficult for her to cope with Jacob over extended periods of time.
On this application the applicant has filed a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health is stable at this point in time and supporting her view that she can care for the child over extended periods of time.
On the basis of this evidence, I am satisfied Jacob will not be at risk if the applicant is granted overnight access, and it is ordered the applicant have access to Jacob as follows:
Every second weekend from after kindergarten on Fridays to 7:00 p.m.  Sunday night commencing Friday, March 12, 1999.
Every Tuesday from 1:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.
Every Thursday from 1:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. in the weeks the applicant does not have access that weekend.
Order accordingly.","FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage,and in the alternative a variation in access.
The father counter applied for interim custody.
The parties agreed in 1997 that the father should have interim custody.
The mother argued that she was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization for unipolar/clinical depression.
The father had been employed as a long distance trucker but now worked days in the city.
HELD: The applications for custody were dismissed.
Overnight access was granted to the mother.
1)The application ignored the consistent law which states the courts should not vary interim custody arrangements whether legal or de facto in the absence of evidence that the child(ren) are in some way at risk, or other compelling reason.
It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child.
The non-primary care parent should proceed to final order which in this provicne means obtaining a pre-trial date for a pre-trial conference and proceed to trial if custody is not resolved at that stage.
2)The court was satisfied on the basis of a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health was stable that the child was not at risk if the mother were granted overnight access.","[0, 71, 1, 2, 3, 70, 67, 4, 68, 69, 66, 5, 6, 65, 7, 62]"

She asks that they be removed as solicitors of record in this action.
The same information as contained in the documents, although perhaps in some other form, was available to the plaintiffs from other sources.
                                                             DISCUSSION
[4]                  There can be no doubt that if a solicitor-client relationship existed between Lois Hudson and Celine-Rose J. Polischuk when she received the confidential documents from Neil Hudson she owed a duty to Lois Hudson.
Unless otherwise satisfied the court would, in those circumstances, infer that all lawyers working with Ms. Polischuk shared her confidences.
Her affidavit to the effect that she did not discuss with or reveal to other members of the firm the contents of the documents is not sufficient to satisfy the public requirement that there be no appearance of breach of confidentiality.
Whatever duty was owed by her was to Neil Hudson.
The fact that Neil Hudson now supports his wife in her defence of the action brought by the plaintiffs does not, in my opinion, change the situation that existed in 1995.
To extend the confidentiality of solicitor-client relationships to the circumstances of this case would, in my view, lead to unreasonable results.
            Since no solicitor-client relationship and no other duty was owed by Ms. Polischuk to Lois Hudson, none existed relating to the law firm which she is a member of.
            The application is dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs.","FIAT. The applicant sought a declaration that the plaintiffs' solicitors had breached confidentiality and were in a conflict of interest and asked that they be removed as solicitors of record in this action.
The applicant's husband had given her personal letters, records and documents to his solicitor in 1995.
These documents were relevant to a defamation action brought by her children or their spouses.
The applicant argued that a fiduciary relationship was created when the documents were accepted which was close enough to a solicitor-client retainer to give rise to a need for confidentiality and that the public's confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined if any member of that law firm acted for the plaintiffs.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs.
No solicitor-client relationship was created between the husband's lawyer and the applicant when the documents were received.
There was no breach of confidentiality or conflict of interest as contemplated by Chapters IV and V of the Code of Professional Conduct.
No fiduciary duty was owed to the applicant when the solicitor accepted the documents from the applicant's husband.
The husband was not acting as agent for his wife nor was it accepted that he delivered the documents for safe keeping.
The husband's solicitor had forwarded the documents to the applicant's lawyer.
The fact that the husband now supported his wife in the defence of her action did not change the situation that existed in 1995.","[0, 53, 10, 21, 52, 22, 51, 23, 1, 50, 17, 49, 24]"

(The wife suffers from MS and is unable to work).
Despite this arrangement the wife has claimed annual expenses of $2,450 for house repairs, maintenance and yard care and $2,600 for house cleaning, the very duties her new partner was to perform.
He is employed, but his income is not stated.
He makes no apparent financial contribution to the household.
The benefits inherent in a shared living arrangement are not adequately or reasonably accounted for in the wife’s presentation.
She has requested a 50% increase in support, because the husband’s income had increased 50%.
By the same logic, one might argue her expenses should be halved due to the shared cost of living, if those shared costs were reasonably accounted for.
These can hardly be endorsed as sound approaches to the determination of spousal support.
            In all the circumstances, an increase is warranted, but not to the extent claimed by the wife.
Spousal support will be varied to $3,500 per month effective May 1, 2002 and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter until further order.
            The wife will have costs fixed in the amount of $1,000.","FIAT. The issue in this application to vary spousal support was whether there had been a material change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support since their 1999 interspousal contract.
The wife requested a 50% increase based on the husband's income increase of 50%.
She suffered from MS and was unable to work.
HELD: Spousal support was varied to $3,500 monthly.
The only material change in the wife's means and needs is that fact she is residing with a new partner who resides in her home in exchange for yard work and housework.

Denby Elizabeth Royal, presently 10 years of age, is a child of the common law relationship of the parties.
After Denby's parents separated they entered into a Custody and Maintenance Agreement on June 22, 1989.
On page 4 of the Agreement the parties agreed as follows:          5.
David is to provide Jodi-Lin with at          least thirty days notice of which days he will be          exercising his rights of access.
The days must be           approved by Jodi-Lin and Denby. 4.        The weekly telephone access shall continue each          Sunday evening and such other times during the week          that do not interfere with Denby's activities.
5.        Access shall once again be reviewed in the fall of          1998 at the request of either party upon providing          five days' notice.
Copy of this Fiat to be sent to David Wolbaum at: 3015 Assiniboine Avenue, Regina, Saskatchewan.

The mother moved with the daughter to British Columbia in 1997.
The parties did not agree upon ongoing access.
HELD: The father's generous and far reaching requests were not reasonable at this time given his lengthy non-contact.
It was important that he be reintroduced to his 10 year old daughter in a gradual and consistent fashion.
He was granted access intitially for three and four hours in both provinces, then two days at the father's parent's home including overnight access and two days in the summer in British Columbia.
Weekly telephone access was to continue each Sunday evening.

The parties separated in the summer of 1994.
There is uncertainty as to what the two children are going to do about future education.
As a result I am of the view that in these circumstances and bearing in mind that this is an interim application it would be premature to apply the amount of maintenance the guidelines suggest.          On the other hand I am of the opinion that the petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the $1500.00 maintenance he consistently paid up to December 1995 to $1,000.00 as noted above without at least consulting with the applicant.
Had these payments continued the applicant would have recovered $6,000.00 at this point in time instead of the $3,000.00 she says she got up to April 26, a shortfall of $3,000.00.          Accordingly I direct that the petitioner pay spousal maintenance to the applicant commencing June 1, 1996 as follows: (a)$1,500.00 on the 1st day of each month; and (b)$200.00 on the 1st day of each month towards the shortfall resulting from the reduction in payent from $1,500.00 to $1,000.00  in 1996 until the said shortfall has been paid in full.          The applicant shall have costs of this application to be taxed in the usual way.                      _______________________________________ J.","FIAT. The parties were divorced in 1995 and all issues including spousal maintenance were left in abeyance.
The petitioner had agreed to pay $3,000 per month which included child support but the support was reduced to $1,000 and was irregular and late.
The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment.
The petitioner's income exceeded $80,000 annually but he had been suspended with pay and the status of his employment was uncertain.
HELD: 1)It was premature to fix the amount of spousal maintenance as asked for by the applicant.
There were too many unknowns including the future of the petitioner's future job and income and how much the applicant would require should she go to university in the fall and what the children would do about future education.
2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the maintenance.
3)The petitioner was directed to pay $1,500 plus $200.00 per month until the shortfall was paid in full.
 4)The applicant was awarded costs of the application.","[1, 20, 0, 2, 18, 19]"

In addition, Donald seeks an order amending the previous orders of Barclay J. on August 19, 1999 and Scheibel J. on December 22, 1999 to the extent necessary to give the relief requested.
                                           HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS
 [2]                The parties who are brothers, have been involved in a dispute over the division of farming assets since July 30, 1999.

 [11]               Donald is now back before the Court seeking another disposition with respect to the above monies.
 [13]               Donald's application is dismissed.
Kenneth is awarded costs of $750.00 which are payable forthwith.","FIAT. The plaintiff sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 344 and 388 directing the manner in which monies paid into court pursuant to garnishee summonses and other monies should be distributed between the parties.
He requested two 1999 orders be amended to the extent necessary to give the relief requested.
The brothers had been involved in a dispute over the division of farming assets since July 1999.
A third party commenced legal action in QB No.3510/99 against the brothers and garnisheed revenues from the Pregnant Mare Urine operation for approximately 1 year.
The brother's application for an injunction to permit him to take over the operation was dismissed in the January 12, 2001 fiat.
His application to set aside the garnishee summonses was granted and all sums paid into court and interest were to be returned subject to provisions in fiat QB No.2259/99.
The plaintiff alleged the breach of conditions in the previous orders entitled him to bring this application.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs of $750 payable forthwith.
The plaintiff was essentially asking the court to sit on appeal.
The orders were clear.","[0, 58, 64, 14, 1, 12, 2, 13, 59, 63, 11, 3, 15, 57, 56, 55, 16]"

The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties.
The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties.
The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs.
With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division.
The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens.
The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported.
Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened.
3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue.
The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted.
The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production.
If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys.
A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing.
The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act.
The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times.
On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a).
5)The second and third tests were not met.
The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value.
It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do.
If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent.
There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan.
The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.","[848, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 847, 6, 844, 840, 1, 16, 843, 10, 842, 845, 17, 8, 7, 19, 836, 841, 13, 846, 837, 826, 832, 18, 28, 22]"

We are unsure if it qualifies as fruits of the investigation but out of abundance of caution it is being disclosed.
The excerpt reads as follows:
3.The day after Colleen Galenzoski testified in chief at the Preliminary proceeding regarding these matters, she contacted the writer to determine if she had given any written documentation to myself at the time of her complaints.
The following sentence in that same paragraph indicates that there was discussion between the two relating to questions asked by defence counsel and states an opinion of the officer resulting from the same, but there is no further recording of what Ms. Galenzoski may have said or what if anything, Sgt. Reid may have said in response.
In my view the contents of this report are marginally relevant and as there is no legal reason why they should not be disclosed, I, therefore, order their production.

The Court of Appeal had ordered the Crown to produce an itemized inventory of the information in its possession to enable the Queen's Bench to review the information the Crown should disclose to the defence.
This fiat concerned several documents.
The Crown had already disclosed the contents of each of these documents and the only matter remaining in issue was the name of the lawyer who released the information.
This arose as a result of the action of a Regina lawyer who had improperly revealed information from two of his divorce clients with respect to the charges against LaPorte et al.
The Crown quite properly disclosed these statements which had been conveyed to the investigating officer.

I agree that the positions put forth by both parties at trial did not result in either party getting exactly what they argued they should.
However, nonetheless the fact remains that an offer to settle was tendered which was not accepted and the trial proceeded.
Again all of this would have been avoided had the offer been accepted.
That is the intent in my opinion of Rule 184B and I shall implement the Rule.
[6]            In addition I wish to use my discretion offered to myself under Rule 545 to award costs as I see fit.
[7]            The combination of Rule 184B and Rule 545 lead myself to the following conclusion.
I order that the petitioner shall have party to party costs under Column 3 up to September 14, 2010.
From September 14, 2010 the petitioner shall be awarded double party to party costs under Column 3.
In addition the petitioner shall receive his costs for this application fixed at $500.00.
Since these matters have now been concluded all costs of course are payable forthwith.

The petitioner served the respondent with a formal offer of settlement on September 14, 2010.

A week after the trial was concluded and while the decision was reserved, the offer was revoked.
The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B.

The fact the offer was revoked does not alter the concept in Rule 184B and the resulting sanction.

The Facts
Her memory was not assisted by hearing the tape of the 911 call, although she did recognize the voice of [D.P.].
The Law
The Crown has made an application to have the initial statements made by the complainant admitted into evidence, for the truth of their contents, as an exception to the hearsay rule.
The onus on the party seeking to tender the statement is on a balance of probabilities.
With respect to the test of necessity, a number of cases have held that this test is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source.
Further these statements were made contemporaneously and spontaneously to a friend without any apparent guile.
The court on appeal also pointed to the accused’s subsequent jealous and possessive behaviour as a further indicator of reliability.
The above cases are instructive as to the type of evidence that might be considered supportive of trustworthiness.
Conclusion
The following circumstances are  evidence supportive of the trustworthiness of the statements made by [A.G.] on September 26, 2006:
(i)         she arrived unexpectedly at her neighbour’s apartment, around 11:30 at night;
Given the above circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, the statements made by Ms. [A.G.] are found to be reliable on a balance of probabilities and are, therefore, admissible.
                      M.L. Gray","The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.
The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents.
HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.
 1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity.
A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source.
2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence.
Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage.
Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application.
The test of necessity has been met.
 3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping.
Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met.
The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.","[99, 112, 98, 100, 51, 97, 52, 1, 2, 111, 96, 50, 3, 54, 101, 14, 55]"

            In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.
            Excepting for the police officers’ notebooks as indicated previously, the format provided, in my opinion, is, in fact, beneficial to the defence over being faced with 30,000 paper documents.
Indeed, it would appear that the preferable method is electronic disclosure to allow defence a meaningful ability to digest, review and call up the relevant documents in a timely fashion.
In the circumstances of this case, is it appropriate for the Court to embark upon a Laporte inquiry and make the appropriate order, if any, regarding further disclosure, or should that issue be left to the trial judge?
If the answer to No. 2 is yes, what is the appropriate order to make on the materials filed?
Defence counsel and Crown agreed that Issues No. 2 and 3 are to be adjourned.
The adjournment of these issues was conceded by defence and Crown to have no impact on the ability of the preliminary hearing to proceed.
                                                             R.C. Mills","The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances.
The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'.
The motion has two components.
The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'.
The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided. 
The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1)
There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence.
In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos.
The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer.
The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested.
The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2)
The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld.
The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available.
What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit.
This information is often crucial for the defence.
3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks.
It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order.
In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.
 4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","[116, 117, 1, 115, 0, 113, 111, 2, 3, 4, 112, 5, 110, 108]"

[1]               The central issue is identity.
[2]               The accused wrote a letter to a fellow inmate within one month of the trial.
The text of the letter is as follows:
DOTY here... [two paragraphs of personal irrelevant information deleted]
And yet he did not identify the accused who was in the prisoner's docket at the preliminary inquiry and at trial (having been remanded in custody).
The accused did not have a mustache at trial, but he did not have a mustache in the photo ID line-up either.
However, this evidence does not stand alone and is buttressed and supported by the adverse inference which I have drawn from the contents of the letter of the accused made within a month of his trial.
The defence urges that the letter may be construed in that light.
I am satisfied that the sole reason for the intended fabrication was to deceive the court; there is no other express or inferred explanation in evidence.
         Accordingly, I find the accused guilty as charged in the Indictment.","The accused is on trial for armed robbery and the central issue is identity.
The Court admitted a letter into evidence in which the accused attempts to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi for him.
HELD: Accused found guilty.
The accused was correctly identified.
The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by.
The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry.
The letter is direct evidence of where the accused was not at the time of the robbery and is corroboration for the identification evidence of the Crown witness.","[213, 0, 1, 3, 2, 210, 209, 4, 7, 205, 6, 8, 5, 9, 10, 11, 14, 203, 202]"

When the complainant had gone to slam the door, the accused had pushed it open.
She had heard the complainant screaming.
The accused had also made some nature of comment that he would stab or hit the complainant’s father, because he had called her, the accused’s mother, a bitch.
As well, there were no other witnesses in the bedroom, except the two of them, at the material time.
As such, perhaps it is possible that the complainant had initiated the physical aggression by hitting the accused on the shoulder in frustration at how matters had unfolded to which he reacted with a blow.
None of that scenario supports the Crown being able to prove that the complainant had not consented to the application of force which had allegedly occurred, and the accused must receive the benefit of the doubt in that regard.
[25]           As such, applying the principles in McKenzie, supra, the Court does not know who to believe, and he is not guilty of the offence of common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.
P.S. Kolenick, J","The accused was charged with committing a common assault against his step-sister being the complainant.
The question was whether the Crown's evidence was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant and whether the Crown was able to prove non-consent beyond a reasonable doubt.

T. Wellsch for Crown
K. Wasylyshen for Accused
          The accused is charged that:
          On the evidence before me, I cannot conclude that the accused's respiratory problems made it impossible for him to provide a sample.
          Furthermore, the accused did provide an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about one hour before.
It was only when he was asked to blow into the mouthpiece of the Intoxilyzer each time that these supposed anxiety attacks caused him difficulty in blowing.
I do not believe his evidence on this point.
          He suggests further that he blew long and hard on the last attempt indicating that he had sufficient air to do so.
Yet, nothing registered on the intoxilyzer.
I find that the intoxilyzer did not register because he was not blowing properly into the mouthpiece.
          Accordingly, I find the accused guilty as charged.
DATED this 23rd day of December A. D. 2002 at the City of Yorkton in the Province of Saskatchewan.
E. S. Bobowski, PCJ","The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code.
He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing.
HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples.
The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed.
The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer.
Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times.
It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel.
2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks.
The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece.
He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior.
The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted.
It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample.
The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused.
Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition.
He should not drink and drive.","[261, 263, 0, 1, 260, 2, 259, 262, 4, 6, 7, 5, 258, 256, 3, 257, 255, 8, 11, 10, 251, 9]"

2.            That the learned trial judge erred in law by excluding evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.
Upon a review of the facts and circumstances and the law, I reject both grounds of appeal.
                                                             THE FACTS
[3]                 On October 22, 2010, the accused travelled from his hometown of Carlyle, Saskatchewan, to Alida, Saskatchewan.
Shortly after, the accused was transported to his home in Carlyle.
                                                             ANALYSIS
          At the center of this appeal are these two sections, both of which are found in the Charter:
      Everyone has the right on arrest or detention
(b)        to retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right;
We also take comfort in the fact that patterns emerge with respect to particular types of evidence.
These patterns serve as guides to judges faced with s. 24(2) applications in future cases.
In this way, a measure of certainty is achieved.
Where the trial judge has considered the proper factors, appellate courts should accord considerable deference to his or her ultimate determination.
                                                          CONCLUSION
                                                                                                                               W. F. Gerein","The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.
After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges.
The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.
The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety.
There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop.
The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device.
The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer.
At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood.
A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings.
A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them.
The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused.
The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook.
The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one.
The accused did not recall this waiver.
The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty.
The accused's readings were .11 and .04.
The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results.
HELD: The appeal was not successful.
Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness.
There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b).
The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice.
The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure.
The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned.
The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective.
The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached.
The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","[21, 0, 1, 210, 20, 213, 209, 137, 2, 208, 72, 136, 22, 207, 19, 138, 139, 23, 206]"

MR. FEDERUIK:                  It’s right on the front, right by his dog house.
(f) Sub-section (e) of s. 135.2 is simply a requirement that you comply with the Regulations and The Animal Disease and Protection Act with respect to detection and control of rabies, but I’m going to include that.
(g) I’m going to include clause (g) of 135.2(5) and require that where the dog is moved to a different municipality you shall notify the Clerk of that municipality.
And I believe that covers all of the conditions that the Court considers are necessary.
A good number of those Mr. Federuik has already complied with, and unless you have any other conditions or any submissions with respect to those, Mr. Saretzky, those will be the conditions.
MR. SARETZKY:                  I think those are satisfactory, Your Honour.
END OF PROCEEDING  ON TAPE RECORDING","The accused was charged with owning a dog that without provocation attacked a person contrary to the Urban Municipality Act s.135.3(3).
There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001.
At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions.
The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced.
HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions.
The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post.
There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled.
The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty.
2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt.
On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation.
3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3).
It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands.
The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed.
logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog.
One would not expect dog to be attached to logging chain if there were no concerns.","[105, 6, 106, 5, 7, 103, 9, 104, 8, 10, 101, 11, 100, 12, 13, 98, 14, 97, 2, 15, 1]"

The accused, Craig Lawrence Kendall Weenie, is charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code.
The Crown’s position is that in these circumstances the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public.
Pursuant to s. 52(5) the person taken into custody pursuant to s. 52(2) shall be released from custody when, in the opinion of a custodian, the person has recovered sufficient capacity that, if released, the person is unlikely to cause injury to himself or herself or be a danger or disturbance to others.
The outcome of all cases depends upon their unique facts.
Thus in R. v. Roberts[1], I found, on the facts of that case, that there were insufficient indicia of impairment to warrant the arrest of Mr. Roberts.
Roberts was walking by himself in a hotel parking lot.
There was no such person in this case.
In my view the arrest was, on these facts, lawful.
The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act.
Rex ex Rel Atkinson v. Montague (1949), 1949 CanLII 400 (ON SC), 97 C.C.C. 29 (Ont. Ct.), and see        definition of “public place”, paragraph a, Alcohol and Gaming Regulations Act, 1997 c.A-18.011","The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code.
The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention.
The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public.
HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act.
There was a complaint to police concerning the accused.
He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment.
He smelled of alcohol.
He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police.
Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol.
He was causing a disturbance to others.
Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place.
No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused.
The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication.
The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go.
In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest.
There was no such person in this case.
The arrest was, on these facts, lawful.","[0, 8, 63, 62, 36, 61, 66, 1, 37, 12, 10, 7, 38, 35]"

INTRODUCTION
[2]            A sentencing hearing was subsequently held December 19, 2011 after which the court reserved its sentencing judgment now delivered.
ANALYSIS
The Sentencing Provisions of the Criminal Code
[18]           The Criminal Code of Canada, and in particular s. 718 of the Code, sets out the fundamental purposes of sentencing.
Failure to do so caused a far longer period of pre-trial detention than was appropriate and this length exacerbates the negative circumstances this accused experienced while on remand.
[33]           In the result, and for these reasons, I conclude that the circumstances justify the maximum credit allowed pursuant to s.719(3.1) of the Code.
DECISION
Sentencing Cases
[34]           In R. v. Aube (supra), Smith, J.A. observed at para.
19 This Court has repeatedly said that the range of sentencing for trafficking in cocaine is 18 months to four years ...
The court concludes that it is in the interest of justice that such an order be made.
In respect of the s.462.37(3) order, the amount involved is $16,325.98 which was transferred to Mr. Mullins’ legal counsel at his request to pay his legal fees.
These funds were part of the proceeds of crime found to be in his possession when he was arrested and of which he is being found guilty.

ZARZECZNY","The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code.
At issue was the accused's sentence.
The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis.
As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence.
As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit.
The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","[9, 124, 0, 150, 149, 125, 69, 15, 148, 68, 122, 126, 127, 120, 147, 10, 71]"

[1]               On January 26, 2011, Brian Ben was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a peace officer with a weapon, contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code.
[2]               The Crown has applied, pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code, for an order remanding Mr. Ben for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have Mr. Ben declared a dangerous offender.
Defence counsel submits the order should not be made as the  predicate offence is not a serious personal injury offence and it is not within the realm of possibility that Mr. Ben could be found to be a dangerous offender.
Is the Predicate Offence a “Serious Personal Injury Offence”?
[3]               Section s. 752.1(1) of Code states as follows:
[4]               In order for the assessment order to be made, the Court must be satisfied that the offence is a “serious personal injury offence”, which is defined in section 752 of the Code, the relevant portion of which reads as follows:
[51]           For all these reasons, I find that it is not beyond the realm of possibility that Mr. Ben could be found to be a dangerous offender.
I order that an assessment be conducted, as contemplated by s. 752.1 of the Code, for use as evidence in an application under s. 753 or s. 753.1.
                                                                               L. D. Dyck, J","The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code.
The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender.
The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender.
The accused was 50 years old.
He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions.
Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers.
He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order.
The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion.
The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer.
The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect.
The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm.
The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family.
HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752.
The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage.
The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage.
Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established.
The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future.
The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour.
Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.
 It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender.
The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","[10, 8, 12, 202, 14, 13, 0, 204, 11, 203, 16]"

2000 SCC 47 (CanLII), [2000]","The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence.
HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed.
There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed.
1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission.
2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us.
All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay.
Any evidence sought to be adduced under the discretion of what is now s. 683 of the Code must be admissible evidence.
With respect to the evidence of Ms. Brinkman, she does not swear that Ms. Bodkin was selling methamphetamine at the relevant time.
3) With respect to due diligence, it must be noted that the appellant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who represents him before this court.
The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward.
If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems.
4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered.","[154, 153, 152, 0, 3, 1, 2, 151, 149, 150, 4, 5, 6, 147, 7, 146, 145, 148, 9, 10, 144, 8, 142, 143, 12, 11, 141, 14, 13, 140]"

It is submitted that the board cannot both confirm and modify the order appealed from; it must do one or the other.
   A reading of the decision shows that the board confirmed the demolition order, but it suspended enforcement of the order for six months to allow Markwart to remedy the underlying problems.
Section 329(3) of The Cities Act may be interpreted to allow for what the board did.
There is no merit to the contention that the board lacked jurisdiction to decide as it did.
However, even disadvantaged persons are entitled to live in rental units that comply with all safety standards.
In summary, this appeal must be dismissed on all grounds.
The board’s order is hereby confirmed.
Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of six months from the date of this court’s decision.
Therefore Markwart is granted a period of six months from July 24, 2009 to bring forth his written proposal as outlined in the board’s decision.

HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds.
The board's order is confirmed.
Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order.
The applicant is granted a 6 month period to remedy the problems identified.
1) The board complied with the directions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure had been made to the appellant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board.

No error of law has been committed.
2) The appellant had all the information considered by the board disclosed to him.

             While the appellant gave evidence before the hearing officer that September was a difficult time to rent the premise in question, the fact is he did not try, because he had decided it would be better going forward to have a furnished premise for rent.
This decision was made not with respect to the possibilities of renting an unfurnished premises as of September 19, 2012, but was a macro decision based on his business going forward.
None of this macro decision can be attributed to the respondent.
The fact that he chose to convert the premise to a furnished one does not alter the foregoing reasoning.
In the absence of any evidence the hearing officer was not in a position to guess whether the premises would have been leased within six weeks or not, and if so whether it would have been leased at the same rent.
             The appeal is allowed with respect to the fixed term issue, and dismissed with respect to the claim for loss.
             Judgment accordingly.
                                                                                                                               R.D. LAING   ","The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer.
The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012.
On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy.
The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice.
The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting.
He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1.
Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy.
The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act.
HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy.
The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term.
The appeal was allowed on this issue.
The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant.
The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss.","[76, 75, 0, 1, 74, 2, 4, 73, 3, 72, 70, 6, 5, 69, 7, 68]"

As well, such policies may well have changed since 1992.          Therefore, for all of the reasons expressed in my judgment of October 15, 1993, as well as those set forth herein, the application is dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause.                                                             J.","The applicant sought to have the law firm barred from acting for the plaintiff because a member of that firm had been active in representing the defendant prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change in government.
This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors.
The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause.
1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff.
This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.
 2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern.
4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme.
It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists.
Also such policies may well have changed since 1992.","[14, 0]"

Robert Peters appeared on his own behalf
He also explained that the quick resolution of Peters’ back problems and the length of time after the accident he was symptom free militated against disc herniation at the time of the accident.
He stated that there can be multiple causes of disc herniation which have nothing to do with trauma.
And pain in the same area after a lengthy symptom free period of time, post accident, could be related to numerous causes other than the accident.
Dr. Flotre's opinion was supported by Dr. Stewart, the orthopaedic surgeon who treated Peters for the herniation, who also opined that the herniation was not caused by the accident.
In his medical report he stated:
He [Peters] is trying to relate this all to his previous accident but I have told him that the disc herniation coincided with the marked exacerbation and right leg pain in late October 1995.
      A review of all of the evidence leads me to conclude that Peters has not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities.
His appeal is dismissed.","The applicant sustained a lower back injury in an automobile accident in February 1995 which resolved within ten days to two weeks.
In June 1995 he began to experience pain in his back which slowly worsened until he was hospitalized in October 1995.
He was diagnosed with a large central and right sided disc herniation.
SGI denied his claim for income replacement benefits as a non-earner under s.117(1) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.
In issue was whether the accident caused the disc herniation.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The plaintiff had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities.
Two family physicians supported his contention but the medical director of rehabilitation services for SGI and the orthopaedic surgeon who treated the applicant were both of the opinion the herniation was not caused by the accident.","[0, 52, 51, 1, 50, 49, 2, 3, 48, 4, 47, 5, 46, 6, 45, 7]"

capacity as executrix of the Estate of Charles John Carlson,
[7]            While Mr. Carlson may have given instructions for a will in 1998 and then changed his mind, there is nothing out of the ordinary about the circumstances surrounding this will.
Evidence now before the court by one of the witnesses to the will is “We sat at the dining room table and Charles looked over the will carefully and signed his name then my wife Doreen Lloyd and I signed as witnesses, one after the other.”

I am not to send the issue for trial unless evidence is brought forth which, if accepted, would tend to negative knowledge and approval or testamentary capacity.

November 13, 1996                                                                          Registrar in Bankruptcy
My only concern relates to whether Mrs. Kolody is a “party” within the meaning of the rule.
She is not a party to the proceeding in the true sense of the word as it involves her husband and S.E.D.C.O.  However, I am of the opinion that since the examination of Mrs. Kolody is not concluded, there may be further applications to the court which could affect the issue of costs as it relates to Mrs. Kolody.
          It’s clear from these reasons that I am prepared to have the taxation proceed as soon as the examination of Mrs. Kolody is concluded.
          In the interests of expediting the taxation at that time, I can advise the parties that I am of the opinion that Column 4 of the tariff is the appropriate column for the costs to be taxed under.
In addition, I am also of the opinion that Mrs. Kolody is entitled to $50.00 per day, for three days, which represents a day to travel to and from Regina, as well as the day to attend the actual examination.
Registrar in Bankruptcy","The bankrupt's wife was examined by SEDCO, pursuant to s. 163 of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.
Following the abortive examination, she was awarded taxable costs.
Prior to the taxation proceeding, SECDO raised an issue with respect to s. 566(o) of the Queen's Bench Rules, arguing that the costs referred to were awarded in interlocutory proceedings an should not be taxed until the final determination of the action.
HELD: The Court held that since the examination was ongoing, there could be further applications to the Court that would affect the issue of costs.
The taxation was ordered to occur after the examination was concluded.","[0, 4, 34, 10, 11, 8, 9, 33, 12, 32, 13, 31, 14, 30, 29]"

Further it submits that the Chief of Police was entitled to amend the ""Notice of Formal Discipline Proceedings"" and in the event that such amendment required leave of the hearing officer, he would be entitled to grant such leave.
Lastly, the respondent submits that the hearing officer erred in holding that s. 54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the member who is the subject of the investigation.
                                                 APPROPRIATE REMEDY
         The respondent submits the Court ought not to entertain the application as there is an adequate remedy, by way of appeal, provided for by the Act.
In particular, the respondent argues the Court should decline to hear judicial review applications of interim decisions in discipline hearings.
I am in substantial agreement with the decision of McIntyre J., which has been upheld by the Court of Appeal, and I do not find there to be significant differences in the circumstances before me.
         I find there is an adequate alternative remedy which should be pursued and find there to be no “special circumstances” upon which I would exercise my discretion to determine the merits of the application.
In the exercise of my discretion, the application is dismissed.","The constable sought a writ of prohibition to prevent the respondent hearing officer from proceeding with the hearing into his conduct pursuant to discipline charges brought against him by the Chief of Police on the grounds there were contraventions of the Act, the Municipal Police Discipline Regulations and the rules of natural justice and the duty of fairness which resulted in the hearing officer having exceeded or lost jurisdiction to proceed with the hearing.
He sought a declaration that a member of the police service must be informed of any investigation of his conduct prior to the commencement of the investigation as required by s.54 of the Police Act.; the Act does not permit the amendment in Form A discipline notice since it is a statutory form.
The relief sought regarding disclosure had been abandoned by the applicant.
The applicant argued that the fundamental questions to be addressed revolved around issues of statutory interpretation that must be resolved on a standard of correctness and the alternative remedies were not adequate.
The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
There is an adequate alternative remedy which should be pursued.
There were no 'special circumstances' upon which the court should exercise its discretion to determine the merits of the application.","[149, 105, 34, 0, 148, 104, 106, 147, 1, 33]"

If this seems unfair it may be that as stated in National Trailer, supra, ""the legislature was prepared to accept the possibility of some unfairness as a price for certainty"".
         In summary then I hold that ownership does not depend upon registration.
There are many unregistered vehicles.
However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership.
         The applicant has also argued that at a time when the registration of the Credit Union had lapsed, she transferred ownership from her husband's name to her name.
Such a transfer would only serve the purpose of defeating the Credit Union's claim if it were undertaken for value and without notice, which was not the case here.
         I therefore hold that the claim of the Credit Union is enforceable as against the conflicting claim of Ms. Clayton.
In the special circumstances of this matter I decline to order costs of either motion.","The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan.
A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001.
After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer.
His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate.
She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession.
At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it.
HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable.
Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance.
The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act.
That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle.
Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry.
Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away.
Ownership does not depend upon registration.
However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership.
A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice.
No costs were awarded on either motion.","[50, 0, 49, 1, 48, 2, 3, 47, 4, 45, 44, 5, 6, 46, 43]"

The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.
By equating this situation to the facts in Prosper, the trial judge has failed to address the real issue, and in turn, has reached a wrong conclusion.
[22]            On all the evidence before the trial judge, the Crown has proved that when the respondent changed his mind and decided not to obtain legal advice, the respondent gave an unequivocal waiver.
That being so, no breach of s. 10(b) of the Charter exists, and the certificate of analyses is admissible at trial.
[23]            The Crown succeeds on its appeal.
However, it would be incorrect to simply enter a conviction on appeal.
As advised by counsel for the respondent, if the certificate of analyses is rendered admissible there may be other evidence tendered on behalf of the respondent to 
challenge the accuracy of the certificate.
Therefore, it is ordered this matter be remitted back to the learned trail judge for continuation of the case, according to law.
                                                                                              A. R. Rothery","The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent.
The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample.
The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer.
HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable.
Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists.
Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice.
2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice.
Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal.
3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated.
The exchange lasted about minutes.
The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","[159, 161, 160, 1, 158, 2, 0, 157, 5, 156, 3, 4, 154, 155, 6, 153, 8, 151]"

Cameron, Caldwell and Herauf JJ.A.
With the greatest of respect, the matter need not, and should not, have been taken up in the context of this case, at least not to the extent and to the effect the judge of the Court of Queen’s Bench thought appropriate.
In our respectful judgment this went quite beyond what the case called for.    
We should add that Mr. Varga was assumed throughout to have been responsible, along with Chisum Log Home and Lumber Ltd, for the operation of the Weyakwin facility.
Hence, he was convicted alongside the company.
Nothing was made of his liability, as distinct form that of the company, either in this Court or in the courts below, so nothing we have said is to be taken as having any bearing on whether he, too, needed a license.
For these reasons, then, we have decided to allow the appeal, set aside the decision in the Court of Queen’s Bench, and restore the decision of the trial judge.
It follows that the convictions must stand.
As for the fines and surcharges, there is nothing in the case to suggest we might interfere with the decision of the trial judge, so they too must stand.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal a Queen's Bench decision that set aside the convictions of the respondents, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. and its sole director, Varga, for operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s. 18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act.
The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga.
The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands.
The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages.
In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act.
HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal.
Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1.
As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents.","[0, 55, 54, 1, 53, 2, 3, 52, 4, 51, 49, 50, 5, 6, 7, 48]"

ALBERT TREVOR PETERS
Nicholas J. Stooshinoff                                                                     for the offender
JUDGMENT                                                                                             POPESCUL C.J.Q.B.
I.         Introduction
[1]                  Albert Trevor Peters (the “offender”) pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common‑law partner contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code.
The offender is a 52‑year‑old man with a significant criminal record.
[3]                  There is no doubt that the offender meets the dangerous offender criteria set forth in the relevant Criminal Code provisions in force at the time.
The appropriate determinate sentence for the charge of aggravated assault in these circumstances is seven years in prison.
Accordingly, the offender is prohibited from possessing any firearm, crossbow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition and explosive substances for life.
            The predicate offence of aggravated assault, for which the offender was convicted, is a primary designated offence within the meaning of s. 487.04 of the Criminal Code.
Accordingly, such an order in Form 5.03 shall issue.
Accordingly, the victim surcharge is waived pursuant to s. 737(5) of the Criminal Code. 
            Section 760 of the Criminal Code provides:
            Accordingly, I order that my reasons for sentencing, together with all exhibits, assessments, required transcripts and documents be forwarded to the Correctional Service of Canada.
                                                    M.D. Popescul","The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code.
The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed.
The accused is 52 years old and in poor health.
He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders.
The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence.
Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community.
The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed?
HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse.
2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women.
3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c).
The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system.
The appropriate sentence should be 7 years.
As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis.
The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","[535, 530, 1, 525, 538, 7, 532, 534, 8, 2, 4, 0, 537, 16, 529, 13, 5, 3, 10, 11]"

Robert G. Richards, for the respondent.
On appeal from:              Q.B.G. No. 290 of 1997 J.C.R.
Oral Reasons By:            The Honourable Mr. Justice Cameron
That in my respectful view is a perfectly rational interpretation to put on the words in Article 16 in the context of Articles 28 and 26 as well as in the context of the whole agreement.
I return briefly to the issue of the rationality of choosing the phrase ""pursuant to"" to mean ""subject to"" even though it is reasonable to choose ""for the purposes of.""
In my respectful view the answer to both questions is an unequivocal ""no"".
In the end, the choice is more a policy decision than a decision driven by law.
In my respectful view such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.
It is for these reasons that I would allow the appeal and restore the arbitrators' majority award.
In the result the appeal is dismissed with costs on the usual scale.","The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions.
She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable.
Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear.
2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'.
Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review.
DISSENT:
The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky.
The Chambers judge did not follow that approach.
Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears.
The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear.
The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation.
Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.","[114, 113, 115, 0, 2, 1, 112, 110, 107, 8, 5, 6, 7, 3, 105, 4, 11]"

 [1]                The defendants bring this application to compel responses to a large number of questions that were objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officers on behalf of Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (""SPMC"").
They also seek an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings.
                                                             BACKGROUND
 [9]                I shall deal with each individual objection in the order as set forth in the defendants' notice of motion except where the particular question has been withdrawn from the application by the defendants.
                                           EXAMINATION OF PAUL NEPPER
 [62]               There were 36 objections taken to questions asked of Mr. Nepper.
That being so I can understand plaintiffs' counsel's suggestion that the question is too complicated.
 [69]               Defence counsel should be able to break the question down so to enable the plaintiffs to provide the desired answers.
                                                       THE UNDERTAKINGS
 [70]               The examinations for discovery of SPMC's proper officers has not been completed.
The defendants have failed to satisfy me that any such exceptional circumstances exist in this case
 [74]               I leave the matter of costs to be dealt with by the trial judge.","The defendants brought an application to compel responses to a large number of questions objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officer for SPMC, and sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings.
The objections were categorized as the questions sought to elicit the plaintiff's manner of investigation or expert opinions; it should have been asked of another witness better suited to answer or third parties as the questions relate to issues between the defendant and the third parties; it was irrelevant or improper.
HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action.
2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire.
3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage.
4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged.
The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal.
5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation.
Questions can be asked of the city.
6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege.
7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague.
The plaintiff's claim was in excess of $7 million.
A proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions and answers given or not given (Hill v. Arcola School Division).
The defendants are not entitled to expert opinion.
8)Whether SPMC's insurer's investigation team participated related to manner of investigation and was therefore privileged.
9)The defendant will be able to examine the city in the third party claim with respect to documents from the fire department.
10)All discussions at mediation proceedings are strictly confidential.
The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged.
11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.
 12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position.
They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date.
Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it.
There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question.
The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement.
19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.
 20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them.
21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed.
It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer.
The same question can be put if the first did not answer it.
The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each.
The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings.
Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was.
Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings.
As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings.
It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with.
There were no exceptional circumstances.
 24)Costs were left to the trial judge.","[0, 335, 1, 27, 324, 25, 2, 323, 24, 26, 3, 325, 49, 322, 28, 334, 295, 296]"

72)              The other option is to return the children to Art and Laura.
On balance, I am compelled to agree with MSS that Art and Laura are not able to provide the boys with an acceptable opportunity or grounding from which they can meet their uncertain and challenging future.
I conclude the best interests of the boys lies in a permanent placement with MSS.
73)              Accordingly, I make the following orders:
Further, there will be an order under s. 37(2) placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister.
The conditions respecting such access shall be as determined by MSS to be in the best interests of David and Michael or as ordered by the Court.

HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister.
As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.
 1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys.
However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context.
There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister.
It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.
 Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them.
When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura.
2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people.
With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level.
Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted.
The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","[6, 4, 382, 375, 376, 381, 7, 2, 1, 8, 5, 0, 9, 10, 11, 374, 378, 372, 380]"

Agreement could not be reached and that dispute later proceeded to trial over two days.
The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past.
Central to this was the determination of the respondent’s income.
BACKGROUND FACTS
Yet there was no variation of the order dated June 29, 2004.
It is fair and reasonable that an appropriate retroactive variation now be effected.
DETERMINATION OF INCOME
[6]            The first task is to determine the income of the respondent.
It presents some difficulty as he is a farmer.
[7]            I begin with the capital cost allowance.
[15]           At that time the income which would have been known was that for the year 2004.
However, that income was distorted by reason of the optional inventory adjustment.
By joining it with the 2005 income the distortion is eliminated.
Today I have the benefit of hindsight and if I am effecting a retroactive variation, I should take advantage of that hindsight.
Accordingly, no child support was payable as of June, 2006 and that continues to the present.
OTHER MATTERS
In the future it may be otherwise.
SUMMARY
                                  Total
CONCLUSION
                                                                                                    W.F. Gerein","The outstanding issue is child support, past and future.
The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past.
Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income.
HELD: 1)
The respondent is a farmer.
His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made.
The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment.
However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose.
It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income.
In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support.
The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%.
An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added.
The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528.
As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005.
2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe.
This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused.
The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally.
It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now.
3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support.
The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable.
3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access.
She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.
 4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","[0, 20, 221, 1, 230, 231, 238, 37, 21, 19, 38, 108, 220, 2, 205, 109, 39, 36, 107, 18, 106, 40, 128, 42]"

[10]  Even if the privilege was somehow to be removed from this letter, it is not relevant.
It does not outline any facts.
It is argumentative, and merely puts forward the position of one party.
At best it is an editorialized prayer for the relief that one of the parties thinks the Court should grant....

Conclusion
12)                  Only rarely should the Court be advised of settlement negotiations and such will be even more rare in chambers applications.
Yes, the matter of costs is at issue in interim applications but arguments for enhanced costs will seldom override the policy of promoting settlement.
Costs can be pursued with vigour after trial if either of the parties is of such a mind.
13)                  The petitioner shall have costs of $500 in respect of the notice of objection, payable within 15 days.

The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner.
The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal.
HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it.
The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it.
The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.","[85, 0, 84, 2, 83, 1, 81, 82, 5, 4, 80, 3, 6, 77, 7, 8, 76, 9, 74, 75, 10, 11, 79]"
889,"The respondent, Calvin Trauter (""Calvin"") counter-petitions for similar relief, including a divorce, joint custody of their children and an equal division of matrimonial property.                               I.          The parties married on September 24, 1983, after having cohabited for about one year.
They separated on October 18, 1994.
They have two children, Dillon, 10, and Levi, 6.          When they married, Brenda was employed in an office at Weyburn, Saskatchewan, and on her father's farm.
Brenda sold her home and applied the proceeds of $49,381.93 toward the purchase of their home there.
There are situations, however, where lump sum support is appropriate.
After February 28, 1999, Brenda is given leave to return to this Court so that child support may again be considered.          The Matrimonial Property Act provides that the welfare of children should displace the other considerations enumerated in the Act.
It is apparent that the children will benefit by living in the matrimonial home for the foreseeable future.          I order that Brenda may maintain possession of the home until Levi's eighteenth birthday, or until she shall vacate the property.
During her occupancy, she shall adequately maintain the home and promptly pay taxes.
When her possession ceases, failing an agreement, the home shall be sold and the proceeds divided in accordance with the foregoing reasons.          I decline to order costs with respect to Brenda's pre-trial motion which I heard by telephone a few days before the trial.","The petitioner sought a divorce, custody, spousal and child support and an unequal division of matrimonial property.
The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property.
HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order.
Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children.
Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job.
It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support.
2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence.
She suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown.
3)The car owned by the petitioner when she married was exempt property.
The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value.
The list prepared by the respondent was used to divide household goods, tools and equipment.
4)The respondent was to assume one-half of the bank loan and it was agreed that the pension funds should be shared equally.
5)It would be unfair and inequitable to the custodial parent to order an equal division of the matrimonial property.
The petitioner was granted possession of the matrimonial home until the younger child's 18th birthday or until she vacated the property.
6)The respondent cannot avoid his responsibility of providing an adequate level of support by turning his back on well-paid employment.
Spousal and child support were deducted from his share of the matrimonial home.
The petitioner was given leave to return to Court after February 28, 1999 for reconsideration of child support.","[125, 2, 124, 1, 3, 6, 123, 120, 126]"

278A  At the close of the plaintiff’s case the defendant may, without being called upon to elect whether he will call evidence, move for dismissal of the action.
The first threshold issue to be considered and answered by the jury will be whether or not any of the defendants breached their professional duty of care to the plaintiff.
This necessarily involves consideration by the jury of the professional judgment exercised by the defendants in choosing to contact and/or call witnesses available to the plaintiff to testify for her and the legal admissibility of their evidence at the trial.
[36]           These matters are reviewed simply to establish that it was clearly known to the plaintiff that the calling of a legal expert to provide opinion evidence was important to her case.
This Court and Mr. McIntyre for the defendants have attempted to assist and accommodate Ms. Palmer-Johnson in her efforts to do so by granting adjournments and giving some direction in communications to her.
The plaintiff, Ms. Palmer-Johnson, was given every opportunity, if not encouragement, to call required experts.
                                              CONCLUSION
The defendants will be entitled to one set of costs only against the plaintiff, the same to be taxed pursuant to column 4 unless any other provisions of the rules with respect to offers of settlement are applicable.","The plaintiff brought a professional negligence claim against her former solicitors with respect to their handling of three charges against her for practising medicine without a licence and one charge for providing medical treatment, while not registered under the Medical Professions Act.

It is implicit in Crooks' letter of September 18 that Tudex would forgo any claim for payments made to Fossil to the time of termination.
That is so because the payment of the retainer for the month of September was enclosed by Crooks with the letter.
Similarly, a case for an award of damages apart from the claim for $56,500 has not been made out.
A final matter.
Fossil amended its statement of claim to provide for a claim of damages relating to common shares of Tudex.
The allegation is that contemporaneously with the contract of June 2, 1981, it was agreed Fossil would purchase the shares and payment for same deducted from the monthly instalments of $6,250 under the primary agreement.
That agreement having failed, Fossil's claim as regards the shares falls with it.
The main issue was whether Fossil's allegation of breach of contract is well founded.
I have determined that it is not.
I would dismiss Fossil's claim with costs.
I would also dismiss the counterclaim of Tudex but, in the circumstances, without costs.

The Defendant supplied the equipment that they agreed to provide and in their view, and which I accept, installed it correctly.
The Plaintiff signed the agreement with Irwin indicating that they were satisfied with that equipment and have had two and a half years with the equipment to inspect it or have someone else look at it to establish if anything was wrong with it.
One would assume that if a business owner continues to make payments on equipment, that he is content with that equipment.
[31]           I must conclude from the evidence I have heard that there is no evidence of fraud or any concealment of facts that would allow the Plaintiff’s claim to succeed.
There is further no evidence of unjust enrichment.

The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale.
The defendant was a developer.
He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act.
The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price.
HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply.
The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA.
There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision.
The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants.
The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price.
Normal bidding rules shall apply.
The plaintiff was entitled to costs.","[72, 92, 0, 155, 1, 71, 156, 2, 94, 154, 93, 95, 69]"

John D. (Jack) Hillson               for the plaintiff
There is also evidence that she categorized some of the payments from E & M as “commission”.
There is evidence that E & M and/or Kelly benefitted the plaintiff and/or her husband by repurchasing equipment that the husband had lost to the trustee in bankruptcy and gifting it back to the husband.
            The foregoing evidence weighs against the finding that this transaction was a loan to the defendant Kelly Eiswerth.
The only discussion she appears to have had was with her husband Ken, after which she wrote a cheque to E & M.
            On the basis of the materials filed and the evidence in the cross-examination held, I find that the plaintiff has not proven that the monies advanced were a loan to Kelly Eiswerth and/or the numbered company 627089 Saskatchewan Ltd. carrying on business as E & M. The claim on Issue No. 1 fails. 
            As that claim fails, Issue No. 2 becomes moot.

The claim is based on the allegation that the plaintiff loaned the defendant Kelly $69,000.
The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month.
HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed.
The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan.
However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made.
In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly.
The only discussion she seems to have had was with her husband after which she wrote a cheque to the defendant.","[72, 73, 0, 1, 71, 2, 4, 3, 66, 69, 70, 5, 6, 7, 65, 8, 9, 64]"

The Court declines to allow this portion of the defendant’s counterclaim.
[49]           I find the plaintiffs Gerald Evin and Beverly Evin are entitled to judgment against the defendant for damages in the amount of $3,822.00 for the necessary repairs and $100.00 for cleaning.
[50]           I find the defendant Marvin Harder is entitled to judgment against the plaintiffs in the amount of $580.00 for Mr. Harder’s unpaid work.
[51]           In the circumstances, the counterclaim of the defendant is set off against the claim of the plaintiffs.
The plaintiffs are entitled to judgment against the defendant in the amount of $3,342.00.
[52]           The plaintiffs claim their costs incidental to the Court action, including the cost of issuing the claim, service, postage, photographs, witness fees, mileage and parking to attend Court.
Many of these costs are not typically awarded in Small Claims Court.
Because the plaintiffs were substantially successful in their claim, the Court will allow the cost of issuing their claim in the amount of $41.00, and their reasonable cost for service in the amount of $50.00.
D.C. Scott, J","The plaintiffs hired the defendant to perform renovations to their home.
The plaintiffs terminated the contract believing the defendant's workmanship was poor and that he caused some damage to their home and created a mess.
The plaintiffs sued the defendant alleging damages.
The defendant counterclaimed the cost of the work completed but for which he was not paid and compensation for the lost use of his tools.
HELD: The Court granted judgment for damages in the amount of $3,822 for necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning expenses and granted the counter-claim in the amount of $580 for unpaid work performed by the defendant and then applied setoff.

Disposition:        Appeal allowed
By:                  The Honourable Mr. Justice Richards
In her reasons for decision in this case, the Youth Court judge quoted at some length from K.P.A. #1 by way of an introduction to her analysis.
I appreciate that in K.P.A. #1 the Youth Court judge was attempting to shed some light on what was then a relatively new piece of legislation.
The risks involved in offering unnecessary opinions are compounded in circumstances where those opinions are put forward without the benefit of submissions from counsel.
Conclusion
The appeal is allowed.
The respondent’s sentence did not run in the time period between the issuance of the warrant on October 8, 2004 and his apprehension on November 4, 2004.
The Crown does not seek to have this matter returned to Youth Court for reconsideration and, as a result, there will be no order in that regard.

                                        LANE J.A.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order.
The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later.
His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act.
The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired.
She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order.
The Crown appeals the decision.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act.
On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended.
2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large.
Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision.
The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted.
Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b).
Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern.
There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision.
That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102.
This means two things.
First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person.
Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3)
The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","[0, 249, 255, 3, 254, 253, 1, 6, 247, 252, 2, 4, 251, 5, 7, 248, 244, 9, 8, 250, 241, 11, 10, 246, 13, 242]"

From this, it is clear that her finding was for procedural purposes only and was not intended to be definitive.
She left it open to the  Superintendent to proceed with his applications when the McMaster action was finished and that her decision respecting his powers was open to review upon further evidence being adduced.
Indeed, it could be said that her findings in respect of s. 8 were obiter dictum as not being strictly necessary to the decision, and made only because that was the way the matter was put to her by a previous decision of the court and the agreement of the parties.
For these reasons, I find it inappropriate to grant leave to appeal.

898,"Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan on December 1, 1993.

In violation of    Section 26(a) of the Saskatchewan    Fisheries Regulations made pursuant to the    Fisheries Act R.S.C., C.F-14, S.1. 2.
In violation of    Section 26(e) of the Saskatchewan    Fisheries Regulations made pursuant to the    Fisheries Act R.S.C., C.F-14, S.1. 3.

If an infringement were found, the   onus would shift to the Crown which would   have to demonstrate that the regulation is   justifiable.
The position of the Crown was that any such evidence must first be introduced at trial where its admissibility can be challenged, and not on appeal.
Argument on this matter was reserved.          In disposing of this appeal, it was not necessary to refer to any of the articles and reports.
As a result, it is not considered appropriate to rule in a ""bulk"" manner on the use, if any, that may be made of such articles and reports on appeal.
The motion is dismissed without commenting on the validity of the point raised.          The appeal is dismissed.            The respondents are entitled to their taxable costs.                                                          J.","The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets.
The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman.
The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue.
The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food.
The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence.
The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence.
Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge.
The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status.
HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed.
The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial.
The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing.
2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone).
The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in.
3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed.
The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet).
4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food.
5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement.
Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable.
The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary.
6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument.
7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","[324, 326, 325, 4, 323, 6, 1, 8, 2, 316]"

Disclosure of the information and materials applied for might, if committed, assist the applicant in his attempt to persuade the Minister not to surrender him.
That argument has not been advanced, nor is it expedient at this stage.
An appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed.
I see no merit in that argument.
The fundamental issue is the extent of Griffiths’ right to disclosure of documents and information.
If he is not entitled under s. 7 of the Charter to what he has requested then concurrent common law rights cannot serve to expand his entitlement.

Tyler McCuaig for the R.M. of Chaplin No. 164
The Grant Agreement is cited in the first paragraph of the R.M. mortgage and the mortgage is clearly intended to be pursuant to the terms of that agreement.
The Grant Agreement, in turn, clearly sets out the parties’ intention that the mortgage be subject to the prior security interest of the respondent.
The appellant candidly admitted that this was its understanding and its expectation at the time the documents were executed.
Thus, the appellant could not, simply by registering the mortgage, create an interest greater than that to which it was entitled by its agreement with Mainline.
For these reasons, we concur in the trial judge’s conclusion that the fee simple mortgage of the respondent has priority over the fee simple mortgage of the appellant.
The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs to the respondent.

The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC.
The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act.
HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant.
The appeal is dismissed with costs.
 1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2)
Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered.
In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties.
This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000.
In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000.
The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent.
Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC.
The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","[0, 179, 178, 2, 3, 177, 176, 172, 1, 173, 171, 175, 4, 7, 170, 5, 6, 169, 168, 174, 8]"

DIVISION OF FAMILY PROPERTY
Background 
A lasting relationship was not formed at that time.
The date they moved in together is uncertain from the evidence.
However, I find that they would have been living together by August 1, 1999.
[8]                  The parties’ first child was born March 18, 2000.
Total adjusted value of family property attributed 
Equalization payment
The amount of family property attributed to Louise is $18,141.92.
Section 26 of The Family Property Act provides for effecting a distribution pursuant to Part IV of the Act.
Upon payment of those monies to Louise, the charge created by this judgment is to be removed from the said land.
Additionally, and by way of equalization:
(a)      Louise is to receive one half of Cory’s pension for the period from August 1, 1999, to July 19, 2005, and that entitlement is now to be transferred to her at source; and
(b)      Leave is granted to either party to apply with respect to Cory’s severance package if one comes into being.

Ms. Fehr’s affidavit was served upon counsel for the plaintiffs and with the Court in June 2012.
Counsel for the plaintiffs has filed a brief of law opposing the Court accepting that affidavit primarily on the basis that it was filed on the eve of trial.
             For the sake of trial efficiency the Court is going to make an interim order subject to further argument by counsel for the plaintiffs on September 5, 2012, if they wish to do so, that the Court accept Ms. Fehr’s affidavit.
Accordingly, she should make herself available for the purpose of cross‑examination, if the defendant corporation still wants to file her affidavit in support of its case.
If not, the Court will disregard the contents of her affidavit.
             The Part 40 simplified trial shall continue on September 5, 2012, in compliance with the provisions of Part 40 of the Rules.
             If any further direction is required of the Court prior to the continuation of the simplified trial on September 5, 2012, arrangements are to be made with the Local Registrar.

DOVELL   ","Under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules (QBR), the plaintiffs commenced an action in 2009 against the defendant for the return of their deposit and the recovery of their costs for plans with respect to a residential construction contract.
The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012.
The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew.
Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved.
This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial?
HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act.
With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action.
As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it.

THE CHILDREN’S AID SOCIETY OF CAPE BRETON-VICTORIA
It is not in the best interests of the children to be returned to the Respondents’ care, either together or separately.
The case has been made out against the Respondents on evidence excluding the opinion evidence.
In the final analysis, and hindsight is a wonderful thing, the expert opinion in this particular case  with this history, was not necessary - at least not necessary to decide if future remedial measures may work.
I find there is no extended family capable of caring for these children as meant by Section 42(3) of the Children and Family Services Act, with the exception of S.M..
The evidence is clear, however, that the extra dedication that is needed to their own children is a long-term commitment, conceivably until they leave home.
These are good and caring people and parents, but it appears a third child would be taking on more than they could handle.

11 Doherty, M.P., The Portable Guide to Evidence, Thomson Canada Limited, 2001, at pg. 54","The Agency applied for the permanent care of four young children, aged 2 to 5 years.
The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents.
The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing.
Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children.
The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents.
The biological father had custody of her at the present time.
The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children.
Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned.
Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province.
Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met.
The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them.
Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional.
Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future.","[874, 819, 791, 873, 820, 814, 0, 872, 815, 2, 790]"

Docket: CA 281587
Registry: Halifax
Appellant
Counsel for the respondents takes issue with several of the factual assertions contained in the appellant’s affidavit, mainly surrounding the birth mother’s alleged past attempts to contact the child and denial of her requests for access.
The appellant, who continues to reside in British Columbia, was not available for cross-examination on her affidavit.
I would admit fresh evidence limited to the portions of the appellant’s affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing (paras.
6, 7 and 8) and the affidavit of Charlene Moore.
Clearly the due diligence requirement is not applicable here.
I am satisfied that the evidence of the appellant’s attempts to be represented at the hearing is reasonably capable of belief; the steps she took to engage counsel were reasonable in the circumstances and that she acted with dispatch.
I am further satisfied that the judge presiding at the adoption application, having ordered notice to the birth parents, would have heard the appellant’s submissions had she been present or represented.
DISPOSITION
[22]         Section 83 of the Act permits an appeal of an adoption order:
I would allow the appeal, set aside the adoption order and remit the adoption application to a judge of the Family Division.
Concurred in:","The appellant appealed the adoption order regarding her natural child.
Although at one time the child had been in the permanent care of the Agency, that order was terminated and replaced by a private guardianship order which had placed the child with the now-adoptive parents.
Although neither of the birth parents, who resided in British Columbia, had attended the adoption hearing, the birth mother now sought access to the child and requested that the court receive fresh evidence as to her unsuccessful efforts to obtain counsel to represent her at the adoption hearing.
Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence.
The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so.
Allowing the appeal would be in the child's best interests as she had resided with the adoptive parents for the past three years and would continue to do so pending the further hearing.","[85, 0, 104, 1, 86, 83, 84, 2, 87, 82, 81, 103, 3, 4, 80, 79]"

THE APPLICATION:
She is the mother of the child, C., born [in 1993], and asks the court, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 37.11(2), to set aside its decision granting permanent care and custody to Family and Children’s Services by order dated November 12, 2002.
THE FACTS:
The admissible paragraphs provide an outline of the Minister’s understanding of what resulted in an order for permanent care and custody.
Arguments of Counsel:
Reference is made in the decision of Squitti v. Squitti [1997]
On behalf of the Agency:
Counsel on behalf of the agency (Family and Children’s Services) argues that the decision and principle set out by Justice Haliburton in Cameron v. Gabriel S.A.R. 01552 July 20, 1999.
A party who has failed to appear on an application through accident, mistake, insufficient notice or other just cause may, within ten days from the time when the order granted on the application comes to his attention, apply on notice to set aside or vary the order and the court may do so on such terms as it thinks just.
There is no provision in the Family Court Rules to set aside an order of the court and in that event reference is made to the Civil Procedure Rules.
for the Province of Nova Scotia.","The mother of a child applied to have the court set aside its decision granting permanent care and custody of the child to the Agency.
When the applicant did not appear at the original hearing, her counsel withdrew as solicitor of record.
She now argued that she had made a mistake in the hearing date.
Application allowed; previous order set aside and matter set down for disposition review hearing.
In order to protect the best interests of the child, the court must take jurisdiction and set aside the previous order to allow the applicant another disposition review hearing.","[14, 110, 1, 104, 121, 96, 103, 38, 15, 92, 18, 109, 17]"

Citation: Brogan v. RBC Dominion Securities Inc., 2009 NSSC 351
Plaintiffs
Defendant
That said there can be no doubt that there ensued substantial, fairly regular and meaningful exchanges of information and documentation among the parties and their counsel in recent years.
All parties have filed their pleadings.
The facts of this case are not as strong as those in Clarke: discoveries have not been conducted, the plaintiffs themselves are more likely to blame for the delay and their loss is purely economic, while the plaintiff in Clarke was seriously injured.
At the same time, RBC itself caused not inconsiderable periods of delay, and repeatedly conducted itself in such a way as to give the plaintiffs the impression that it intended to proceed.
RBC attributes its own delay to the collection and preparation of documents; the three-year delay attributed to the plaintiffs in responding to the Demand for Particulars concerned the preparation of similar documentation.
Moreover, the Demand for Particulars requested details of conversations with Mr. O'Neill that could have been explored through the discovery process.
On balance, in view of the drastic nature of the dismissal remedy and the divided responsibility for the cumulative delay, I believe that the balance weighs in favour of preserving the proceeding.
Conclusion
The parties shall bear their own costs.","The action, originally filed in 2000, concerned allegations of breach of - fiduciary duty, trust, industry regulations/standards, contract; and claims of negligence and malpractice.
These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant.
The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years.
The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars.
There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest).
The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim.
Application dismissed.
While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years).
While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant.
There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay.
After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here.
On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice.
There is a significant documentary record of the transactions.
The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner.
The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time.
While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice.
Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","[440, 435, 436, 433, 0, 432, 4, 6, 431, 434, 426, 1, 424]"

In assessing pecuniary damages, the court accepted the defendant's expert evidence which led to the conclusion the plaintiffs businesses were marginally profitable.

The court approved a 5% capitalization rate as being appropriate where there was an eight year term to age 65.
The plaintiff settled his future Section B benefits just before trial.
The court rejected the defence argument that they were entitled to a credit for present value of those benefits which represented a figure over seven times the settlement figure.

In this way the public will learn what facts were accepted as proven by the court.
[37]           The open court principles were crafted at a time when the internet was not a public source of information nor of manipulation.
Initially these principles were developed in criminal cases where scrutiny to ensure the state was not abusing it’s powers of arrest and imprisonment was paramount.
This case involves the court as a provider of a dispute resolution process.
The state has passed laws that create a framework for that dispute resolution but the potential for state abuse of the parties is limited if nonexistent.
The public interest in the process, and in the performance of the judges, remains to be served by the opportunity for the public to attend the hearings and read or listen to decisions rendered.
The media can attend and publish what it wishes about that hearing and those decisions.
I  grant the applications requested.
This divorce file shall be sealed in its entirety.","Rule 85.04 – Order for confidentiality
The parties moved under Rule 59.60 to have the court seal their file after media asked to view it.
They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.
 , the file will be sealed.
While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does.
The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies.
A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs.
Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough.
Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents).
Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern.
The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place).
There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff.
The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered.

The report also deals with Identification and Terms of Reference, Process and Documents reviewed, and Background Issues Regarding Suicide and, like the findings as to the treatment, diagnosis or assessment and care of the three deceased, these are not matters of peer review.
If this information is less than what they believe they are entitled to receive, they will no doubt wish to review this circumstance with persons and advisers of their own choosing.","Following three patient suicides at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital, the hospital, in response to concerns and questions from family members, retained two psychiatrists to review the cases, the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the cases, patient records and hospital policies and practices.
At the end of the review they were to provide a written report to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer.
The hospital staff participating in the investigation and review were advised that their information would be treated as part of a 'peer review' and therefore confidential.

She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship.
The Chambers judge dismissed the application.
He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter.

STATED CASE 
The Prothonotary
Summary report of findings of John G. Khattar, an Adjudicator of the Small Claims Court of Nova Scotia.
The matter first came before Small Claims Court with an affidavit to request an Order for Substituted Service, dated April 2, 2010.
The matter was to return to court on May 18, 2010.
Service having been properly effected on the Respondent, the Court is not prepared to interfere with this finding of the Small Claims Adjudicator . 
In the result, the Appellant must  accept the consequences of his decision , to ignore the notice .
While I find little merit to his argument he knew nothing of the hearing date, the finding of fact that service had been effected does not result in a failure of natural justice as the court had the jurisdiction and authority to grant such an order.
It therefore follows, that the court was entitled to issue default  judgement against him.
I find therefore that the Appellant’s appeal is without merit.
Accordingly the Appeal dismissed with costs . ","The small claims adjudicator granted an order for substituted service after the respondent had trouble serving the appellant with notice of her claim.
As per the order, she personally served the appellant's mother and notified the appellant of the hearing date by text message.
He didn't appear and default judgement was granted against the appellant in the amount of $11,031.35.
The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice.
He denied being in contact with his mother.
He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries.
New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal.
Appeal dismissed.
The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny.
Here the respondent's claim was valid.
The adjudicator had the jurisdiction/authority to make an order for substituted service and the respondent followed it.
At the very least, the appellant was notified of the hearing dates by text message(s).
While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set.
He failed to prove he had a reasonable excuse for defaulting, chose to ignore the notice, and was mistaken only as to what would be the outcome if he failed to appear.","[24, 101, 0, 99, 25, 100, 27, 1, 97, 26, 98, 96, 28, 30]"

In the cases of Weber and O’Leary, supra, the court has reaffirmed this view.
I think it is of fundamental importance in Weber that the limits of court jurisdiction can only be understood in light of the breadth of arbitral jurisdiction.
Weber was not a case in which it was suggested that neither the arbitrator nor the court would have jurisdiction to determine the rights of the parties.
[34]           Similarly, the only issue addressed in these reasons is whether this court action should not proceed because an arbitrator has not, in the first instance, determined the issue of arbitrability.
Broader issues as to the substantive rights of the plaintiffs, if any, have not been addressed.
As a consequence, I would, as Justice Cromwell did, stay the present proceeding, pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable to the parties and the disputes in question.
Also, so as to avoid the possibility of this action being suspended indefinitely, I would add the proviso that if no application is made to lift the stay within two years of the date of these reasons, then this action will stand dismissed.","The plaintiffs were Sergeants in the Town of Bedford Police Department.
Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank.
The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement.
After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights.
The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter.
Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed.
Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court.
It is irrelevant if the plaintiffs have now lost their rights to initiate the arbitration process.","[170, 0, 205, 7, 171, 204, 203, 202, 153]"

)        November 9, 1999
This is an appeal by the Director of Assessment from a decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board.
An appeal to this Court lies on any question relating to the Board’s jurisdiction or upon any question of law; s.30(1) of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board Act, 1992, c.11.
The Regional Assessment Appeal Court made a decision respecting property in Port Morien in the respondent Cape Breton Regional Municipality.
The respondent Paul Warren appealed the decision by filing a notice of appeal with the Board on October 13,1998.
He did not serve notice on the clerk of the Municipality, but the clerk of the Board forwarded the notice to the Municipality.
When such waiver occurs, the failure to comply with the provisions for service do not constitute a bar to the Board’s hearing the appeal.
We think that reasoning applies to the case before us.
It is not therefore necessary to consider the other points raised in argument.
The appeal is dismissed with costs to each of the respondents, Warren and the Municipality, in the amount of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) plus disbursements to be paid by the appellant.
Concurred in:","The appellant appealed a preliminary decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board which held that it had jurisdiction to hear an assessment appeal where, although the appellant failed to comply with the service requirement of s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act, the party not properly served waived the requirement.
Dismissing the appeal with costs,
that where the party that was not properly served expressly waived its right to notice as required by statute, the Board had jurisdiction to hear the appeal.","[2, 0, 20, 49, 21, 48, 22, 47, 23, 46, 45, 18, 24]"

ROSCOE, J.A.: (orally, in Chambers)
This is an application for bail pending appeal pursuant to s. 679(3) of the Criminal Code.
The hearing of the appeal from conviction is scheduled for March 20, 1996.
B.C.J. No. 654 - seem to place a higher onus on the appellant at this point in the legal process than is the case after sentencing.
For example in Smale, Associate Chief Justice MacKinnon said at p. 128:
That jurisdiction should only, it appears to us, be exercised in unusual and limited circumstances but it does exist.
In R. v. Morris, Morden J.A. said it is a rare case where bail is granted pending sentence and in R. v. Osolin, MacFarlane J.A. said the jurisdiction should be granted in unusual and limited circumstances.
It appears that in those cases the Appeal Court judges relied heavily on the trial judge's assessment of whether it was in the public interest to keep the convicted person in custody pending sentencing.
I will hear counsel respecting the terms of the release order.

The accused is charged with one count of committing sexual assaults contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code.
The accused is the step-father of LdW.
LdW turned 14 years old [in 1995].
The allegation is that between January 1992 and August 1995 the accused had sexual intercourse with  LdW on numerous occasions.
These would be some of my reasons for concluding that the blood sample taken from the accused was obtained reasonably and lawfully pursuant to a duly authorized and lawfully executed warrant.
Further, it has been put to a proper purpose.
There was no violation of the accused’s s. 7 or s. 8 Charter Rights.

I believe she wants to be employed.
I do not accept for a minute that she is lazy.
She is ill.
She is afflicted with a terrible illness and Mr. Puddifant must be patient.
In conclusion, I find that she requires ongoing support.
Since the granting of the original order, Mr. Puddifant has left the military in the interests of his family.
Their son, Tyler, has spent much less time with his mother than was anticipated by the court at the time.
[15]         Ms. Fraser is now in receipt of income from her share of the pension, which was just over $58,000.00 upon division.
Thus I conclude that there has been a change in circumstances as required by the Divorce Act before a variation can be considered.
This application was heard in June 2005.
Should there be a change in the parties’ circumstances before then, an application to vary may be warranted, but in any event, the spousal support will end in August 2008.","The husband applied to vary a corollary relief judgment in order to either terminate spousal support or decrease it with a fixed date for termination.
The parties were married for twelve years and had been divorced for seven years.
The husband had been paying $600 per month in spousal support since the divorce and had recently retired from the military; his current income was now primarily derived from his pension.
The wife had serious long-term mental illness and was unable to manage employment.
The parties' teenage son was now solely in the husband's care.
Spousal support reduced to $300 per month payable for a further three years at which point it will terminate.
Notwithstanding the wife's disability, the husband's obligation to her should not extend beyond the length of their marriage; although the wife might not be able to become totally self-sufficient, there was no evidence that she was unable to contribute anything at all towards her own support.","[0, 80, 1, 157, 2, 79, 3, 78, 4, 76, 161, 5, 77, 6, 74, 75, 73, 72, 7, 8]"

There appears also to have been some witness fees provided to some of the witnesses, although full details were not provided.
At first blush, it appears that the disbursements expended on this case are high, if not actually excessive.
I have some difficulty understanding why it was thought necessary to subpoena the Defendant Renouf.
Some of the other minor witnesses were only marginally helpful.

Torts §66","The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property.
The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend.
As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut.
He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees.
The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field.
At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages.
The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money.
1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages.
That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose.
2. Burrows is not liable.
He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable.
It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do.
Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise.
The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm.
3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help).
While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed.
Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements).
While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial.","[214, 14, 213, 212, 15, 16, 13, 17, 18, 209, 208, 207, 19, 211, 206, 204, 22, 205, 21, 23]"

Relief granted;
to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties.

I also note that the knapsack contained, in addition to the drugs and money, a wallet containing the defendant’s identity papers, and other personal items.
It is also obvious that he had control of the bag and its contents until he left the motor vehicle.
I find that the defendant was in possession of the marijuana and cocaine found in his knapsack.
For the purpose of trafficking
The uncontroverted expert evidence of Cst. Robinson is that the amounts of both marijuana and cocaine and all of the circumstances here establish that the possession was for the purpose of trafficking and I so find.
Possession of property obtained by crime
Hence I find that the defendant had them in his possession knowing that they were obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment.
Conclusion
The defendant is guilty of all three charges before the court.","The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking.
When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer.
While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it.
The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash.
In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers.
They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle.
The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted.
The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle.
When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left.
The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial.
The defendant was found guilty on all charges.
The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession.
The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there.
The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","[79, 0, 1, 77, 78, 2, 4, 3, 75, 74, 5, 72, 73, 6, 71, 7, 69, 8, 9]"

Although it is unfortunate that the Burke exhibit of one crack stone was destroyed, I accept that Exhibit #6 is helpful as an analysis report.
[64]         Constable Lane also testified as to the immediacy of the need of the buyer and the usual practice of going directly to a place to smoke crack cocaine undetected from view as soon as the purchase is made.
[65]         Mr. Burke’s conduct was consistent with that pattern, complete the purchase and make a quick retreat.
And I should say that I have considered the weight of Constable Marriott’s evidence in light of the Hernandez case.

In its totality, I find his evidence to be credible.
In the result, I find that the Crown has proved its case.
Mr. Carvery is guilty of the offences with which he is charged.
Justice M. Heather Robertson","The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking.
He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction.
After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building.
Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand.
The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged.
A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket.
Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level.
The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall.
Accused found guilty on both counts;
the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction.
The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation.
Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.","[5, 0, 161, 19, 160, 18, 20, 159, 21, 157, 158, 156, 24, 155, 23, 22, 25, 154, 152]"

The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details.
He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father.
Accused found guilty of all counts.
Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances.
Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor.
The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","[450, 444, 1, 452, 8, 443, 442, 0, 441, 2, 6, 439, 4, 3, 11, 7, 9, 447]"

It is unnecessary in the present case to consider those circumstances which would warrant a variation in support under an agreement.
The Family Court had thoroughly reviewed the circumstances of the parties on two occasions and refused to grant relief.
In my view the circumstances in this case did not warrant a variation.
A change in one year in the respondent's financial circumstances was not sufficient to vary the agreement entered into between the parties.
The learned trial judge erred in failing to apply the principles in Pellech.
I would allow the appeal without costs and set aside the judgment and order of Hall, L.J.S.C.
Looking at the husband and wife relationship in a traditional marriage, a wife, who is dependent on her husband's income during the marriage has the benefit of his good times and suffers when his income falls.
In my opinion this principle espoused in Pelech, Richardson and Caron should be confined to similar cases.
Each case must be decided on its own facts.
NOVA SCOTIA COURT OF APPEAL
JOSEPHINE JUNE MOOY 
CORNELIUS GERARDUS MOOY
REASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY: JONES, J.A.","This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards.
The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children.
Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home.
The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties.
The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal.
The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final.
Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order,
that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected.
There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision.
The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases.
To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties.
Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period.
The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period.
Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","[107, 0, 1, 106, 273, 105, 104, 209, 3, 2, 272, 207, 102, 103, 210, 271, 4, 270]"

S.C.J. No 18, both of which were decided after its release.
In summary, I see no grounds for appellate intervention in his decision regarding ownership of the joint account.
As to the probate court judge’s failure to rule on the appellant’s allegations during the hearing of breach of trust and conflict of interest against the adminstratrix, this was not before the probate court.
The matter had been remitted by this court for determination only of the ownership of the joint account.
By not addressing this matter, the probate court judge did not err.
I would dismiss the appeal, and order the appellant to pay costs of $500 to Ms. Gregoire.
The estate has not yet paid the costs of $500 to each of the parties as ordered by the probate court judge.
If she wishes, the administratrix may apply the $500 the appellant was to receive there against the costs he is here ordered to pay Ms. Gregoire.
Concurred in:","At the time of the deceased's death, she held a bank account jointly with her daughter.
Although the signature card signed when the account was opened could not be found for the hearing, the probate court relied on the evidence of the bank representative (who testified that she had the card when she closed the account and she was 100% sure that the account was a joint account and who was able to present to the court the form of the applicable account agreement) in determining that the monies in the joint account belonged to the daughter.
 It was also found, on a strong balance of probabilities, that the deceased intended to make an inter vivos gift to her daughter and, alternatively, that the evidence rebutted any presumption of resulting trust in favour of the deceased or her estate.
Another of the deceased's children appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
the probate court judge did not misapprehend the evidence, lack an evidentiary basis for his findings, rely upon incorrect legal principles or fail to apply or misapply the law.","[0, 1, 103, 102, 101, 99, 98, 2, 100, 3, 97, 5, 4, 96, 8, 6, 7, 94, 95]"

In his reasons he carefully reviewed the testimony offered by the witnesses who had just appeared before him.
While Justice Bryson did not specifically refer to the principles set out in R. v. W.(D.), 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991]
R. v. Mah, 2002 NSCA 99 (CanLII).
[11]           In the end, Justice Bryson accepted Mr. LeBlanc’s evidence as to what had occurred, accepted Ms. Deviller’s evidence as to who strangled the victim, and rejected the appellant’s testimony and denials of responsibility.
Read as a whole, we are satisfied that the judge properly assessed all of the evidence, recognizing throughout that the ultimate issue was not credibility but reasonable doubt.
We see no error in his conclusion that the appellant’s culpability for the robbery and the assault had been established beyond a reasonable doubt.
[12]           For all of these reasons we would dismiss the appeal.
Concurred in:","The defendant, who was in a very small apartment with two other individuals, got up from the couch and proceeded through a doorway behind the complainant, purportedly to use the bathroom.
A few minutes later, the complainant found something wrapped around his neck and he was choked until he passed out.
When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him.
She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back.
The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat.
Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door.
Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay.
When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked.
She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest.
Appeal dismissed;
 it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility.
Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence.
The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony.","[0, 18, 86, 19, 20, 85, 84, 21, 1, 17, 22, 83, 23, 24, 81, 16, 25, 2, 82, 26, 78, 79]"

This is a matter of major concern in the construction industry in Nova Scotia.
If the case is to be re‑considered, then it is proper for the Appeal Division to do that.
In the first instance I have to deal with the question of whether or not certiorari lies in this case, with respect to the actions of the Deputy Minister.
I then refer to the decision of the Appeal Division in Boyd and Garland where Chipman, J.A. stated, in part:
""I accept he view of Richard, J. that the provisions of Part II establish a scheme where, in the construction industry, there is an exception to the general rule that there are only two methods by which a union can obtain bargaining rights for the employees, i.e. (a) certification and (b) voluntary recognition.""

RELIEF SOUGHT:
That the appellant be granted a stay of proceedings.
Does a declaration of a mistrial on a summary conviction charge constitute an ""order' pursuant to Section 813(a)(i) of the Criminal Code, from which the accused can Appeal?
During the course of the trial, the Trial Judge declared a mistrial 'and set a new date for trial to September 27, 1994.
(ii) against a sentence passed upon a defendant.
Defence counsel contends a declaration of a mistrial is equivalent to an order of the court bringing an end to the trial in this case and, therefore, he has the right of appeal against that order.
An order under Section 813(a) of the Code must be a final order in the sense it brings to an end that particular proceeding.
In R v. B & B Stone Ltd. (No.2), 34 C.C.C. 2(d) 464, Amup, J. A. stated, at page 471:
""I would respectively agree that an ""order or determination"" must be ""final"" in the sense that it brings to an end that particular proceeding, before an appeal will lie.
No Appeal, therefore, exists to the appellant.
The Appeal is dismissed and the case remitted to the Provincial Court for a new trial on the information still before the court.
I order no costs against the appellant.","The appellant appealed a decision of the trial judge declaring a mistrial in his summary offence trial and setting a new date for trial because the Crown had not disclosed a police record.
 He argued the judge erred by not ordering a stay of proceedings and/or a dismissal at the beginning of the trial, and by failing to find the non-disclosure violated his rights under s. 11(d) of the Charter.
He sought a stay of proceedings in this action.

Aggravating Factors
          Pursuant to s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code, these circumstances shall be considered to be aggravating by any sentencing court.
          In considering this issue, I note the comments of Madam Justice Hunter in R v Akapew, 2009 SKCA 137 (CanLII) at paras 21-22,  343 Sask R 155 in relation to parties to offences:
This factor was emphasized by the trial judge when she considered each of the sentencing principles of proportionality, parity and totality of sentence.
There is nothing in the language of s. 21 that provides that the degree of culpability is different for any of the four ways a person may be a party to an offence.
          Section 348.1 is applicable to all three accused even though their level of participation in the crime differs.
2.            He shall appear before the court when required to do so by the court.

The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him.
The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years.
The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth.
The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation.
A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge.

There is inadequate evidence before the Court to appreciate the consequences on the form, length and structure of the resulting proceedings to knowledgeably make such a determination.
As for the Applicant’s request to have the trials heard in sequence, I decline to consider that matter.
That request was raised for the first time by the Applicants in their reply oral submissions.
Their written submissions had specifically indicated they were not seeking sequential trials.
It is unreasonable in my view, to “switch gears” at such a late stage, without giving the Respondents any type of reasonable opportunity to meaningfully address the request.
As an observation, Rule 37.04 may have the most applicability to the present instance.
It was, however, not relied upon by the Applicant.
Perhaps, should the common issues and factual matters be better articulated, the 
Court could, in future consider the appropriateness of a remedy thereunder.
The motion is accordingly dismissed.

The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions.
The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation.
The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation.
The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions.
The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court.
The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants.

ANALYSIS
There was some debate between counsel as to whom was entering Ms. Bigsky’s apartment, and actually conducting the search.
In my view, this issue is somewhat relevant to some factual findings to be made by the Court, but not of large legal significance.
Ms. Buchanan is an officer appointed by The Child and Family Services Act, and as such has certain powers under that Act.
She requested and obtained the assistance of Moose Jaw City Police.
Corporal Mickleborough assisted.
THE ACCUSED ACTIONS IN KICKING AT AND STRIKING JENNIFER BUCHANAN CONSTITUTED AN ASSAULT.
WERE THESE ACTIONS JUSTIFIED ON THE BASIS OF DEFENCE OF PROPERTY OR DEFENCE OF A THIRD PERSON?
Given my decision on the Charter issues, I need not decide this issue.
However, I note that in the Krzychowiec decision, referred to by Mr. Wiebe, the Honourable Judge Gibson acquitted the accused on the basis that his use of force was a justified defence of property and person.
He noted that the actual force utilized by the accused was minimal.
For these same reasons, I would conclude that Ms. Bigsky used minimal force and the use of that minimal force was justified.
CONCLUSION
D. Kovatch J","HELD: The accused was found not guilty.
The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached.
Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home.
The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search.
The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit.
The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home.
There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house.
The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights.
The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children.
The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights.
The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence.","[8, 332, 326, 0, 325, 179, 324, 177, 321, 178, 322, 180, 323, 320, 182, 181]"

I           INTRODUCTION
[2]               This case arose during the early morning hours of that day.
Cst. David Cobbledick, of the Kamsack RCMP, had a motorist pulled over at 2:50 a.m. in the village of Togo.
Just as he was completing that stop, he heard a truck, which turned out to be one driven by Mr. Lehman, on an adjacent street.
He engaged his emergency lights, and came up behind his truck.
Mr. Lehman spun his tires and fish-tailed, and in the officer’s words sped up rapidly and “took off”.
The motive for evasion, assuming the absence of a reasonable excuse, is of no moment.
[35]           There is no doubt on the evidence that Mr. Lehman attempted to get away from the police officer when he turned on his emergency lights, because he was afraid of the legal consequences that could befall him at that point.
VI.      CONCLUSION
[37]           For the reasons I have stated, Mr. Lehman is found not guilty on the impaired driving charge (count 1), guilty on the over .08 charge (count 2) and guilty on the flight from police charge (count 3).

2007 ABCA 110 (CanLII) at para 10.","Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08
The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)).
As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours.
When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off.
The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house.
The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD.
He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17.
The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired.
He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him.
He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples.
The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal.
The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving.
The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes.
The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45.
An alcohol expert and the accused testified.
The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to.
The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer.
The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007.
HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence.
The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis.
The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections.
The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption.
Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions.
The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances.
The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping.
There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face.
The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.","[8, 0, 12, 148, 10, 144, 146, 13, 145, 141, 14, 17, 143, 16, 140]"

                      Brent D. Barilla, Q.C.                                                           for the petitioner
[1]                                      The petitioner’s application seeks orders granting her exclusive possession of the family home, primary residence of the children and supervised access only for the respondent father.
k.         Each of the parties shall ensure that the family home is clean, orderly and maintained to a level consistent with what has historically been the practice;
                            I award the respondent costs of $2,000 in any event of the cause to be payable by the petitioner within 30 days.
These costs are awarded because it is my conclusions that:
a.         The without notice application was inappropriately and unnecessarily brought and when all of the evidence is considered I have concluded that the August 18, 2016 order should not have been granted;
The petitioner has not succeeded in her application for exclusive possession or supervised access only;
c.         The respondent has succeeded in his application that there be shared parenting and to set aside the exclusive possession order;
d.         Counsel for the petitioner failed, due to a misunderstanding as to the adjourned date, to attend on September 1 and thus counsel for the respondent was in attendance on both September 1 and 2.
                                             B. SCHERMAN","HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made.
The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography.
The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner.
The petitioner did not dispute that evidence.
The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions.
The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction.
The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent.
With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated.
The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD.
The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent.
It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis.
A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children.
The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting.
The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.","[297, 296, 3, 2, 299, 0, 298, 294, 5, 290, 1, 8, 295, 6, 7, 13, 293]"

To better organize this judgment, it has been divided into the following subsections:
                            This ground of appeal is assessed on the standard of correctness.
There appears to be no contest that the appeal from the Board to the Tribunal is a de novo appeal, not an appeal based purely on the record.
This was actually acknowledged by the Tribunal in its decision (paras.
4 and 5) although, as discussed in more detail below, the Tribunal may have misapprehended the nature of the task actually before it. 
                            The appellant submits that the Tribunal erred in not conducting its analysis as it ought to have; that is, as a de novo hearing.
There was no independent analysis of the evidence conducted, nor is same readily apparent from the reasons for the Tribunal’s decision.
It is argued that this is explicit in the Tribunal decision.
[202]                             The respondent argues that the matter could be referred back for adjudication.
[205]                             The appellant invited the court to also quash the pending discipline proceedings.
It strikes me that this is beyond the strict jurisdiction of this court’s powers on this type of appeal.
However, if the operative referral mechanism to discipline was the Board’s decision, and that has been overturned, it may well be that the discipline matter is at an end.","HELD: The appeal was granted on the basis of the first two grounds as well as others.
The court quashed the tribunal’s decision and reinstated the appellant’s hospital privileges.
The court reviewed the transcript of the tribunal’s hearing and its written decision.
With regard to the first two issues, it found that the tribunal had erred in law in the following ways: 1) by failing to conduct a de novo hearing as required.
It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision.
It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent.
It merely accepted the evidence of the SMO’s experts.","[365, 1216, 1217, 15, 361, 0, 363, 366, 372, 370, 1210, 1218, 368]"

ANALYSIS
          What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant?
                The accused filed an application for Charter relief in the form of the exclusion of evidence pursuant to ss. 24(2) as a result of a breach of the s. 8 rights of the accused.
The date for the conduct of the voir dire was established by agreement of counsel at a pre-trial conference.
There was no dispute taken by the Crown to the procedure employed by the accused in this regard.
On the voir dire, it is for the trial judge to determine whether the conditions precedent to the admissibility of the proposed evidence have been met.
A computer search pursuant to a warrant must be related to the legitimate targets respecting which the police have established reasonable and probable grounds, as articulated in the warrant.
                Here the ITO sought only the “search history”.
                As a result of the forgoing, evidence of the search history was validly obtained pursuant to the execution of the search warrant.
Any other evidence obtained was not pursuant to the search warrant and is accordingly a violation of the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights.
M.T. MEGAW","The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography.
The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant.
She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence.
The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO).
The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility.
The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography.
The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”.
The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment.
The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower.
The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos.
The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs.
The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused.
The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant.
The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone.
The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).
The application proceeded by voir dire.
The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire.
The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device.
| HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained.
Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights.
The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search.
The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established.
Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement.
The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities.
Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant.
The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record; 
2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means.
This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search.
It was not admitted;
3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context.
There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant;
4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety.
However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence;
5) The ITO provided sufficient description.
It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO.
Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and 
6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence.
The ITO sought only the search history.","[12, 0, 327, 91, 326, 94, 92, 90, 323, 93, 324, 328, 97]"

IN THE MATTER OF A HEARING UNDER
If that were the criterion for a protection order, not many children would remain with their natural parents.
I am also satisfied that this failure is likely to cause C.T. physical and/or emotional harm.
                The next question pertains to the appropriate order to be made once a child is found to be in need of protection under s. 11.
Section 37 sets out the tools available for the court to promote the well-being of a child found to be in need of protection under s. 11.
With emphasis on the specific provision raised by the Ministry, s. 37 reads as follows 
Subject to subsection (2), if the court determines that a child is in need of protection, the court shall make an order that the child:
(a) remain with, be returned to or be placed in the custody of his or her parent;
(b) be placed in the custody of a person having a sufficient interest in the child; or
                In the result, there will be an order placing C.T. in the custody of the persons of sufficient interest, Mr. and Ms. R., on an indefinite basis.
R.W. ELSON","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order committing a two-year-old child to the care of his maternal grandparents for an indefinite period of time.
The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest.
The child had lived with them since birth.
The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born.
The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences.
The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges.
The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents.
Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order.
Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child.
Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child.
Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate.
| HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order.
That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father.
The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions.
On their own, such statements were insufficient.
There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change.
These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.","[219, 218, 220, 221, 216, 217, 309, 0, 215, 3, 2, 310, 5, 211]"

Introduction
They were not mistaken about the requirements of the law.
[106]                              Rather the mistakes they made were twofold:
This mistake, arguably legal, was coupled with a mistake about a set of facts.
They held a mistaken belief that the information contained in the letter provided to them by Oscar was accurate.
Such a mixed mistake exculpates because the belief demonstrates a mental state inconsistent with that required for guilt.
          The Possession of Property Obtained by Commission of an Indictable Offence
[108]                              I am not satisfied on the evidence that the $6,210 in cash found in their house was obtained by the commission of an indictable offence.
I am not in a position to disbelieve the accused’s evidence as to the origin of these funds.
Thus the circumstantial evidence surrounding these funds is not such as to be inconsistent with any reasonable alternative but guilt of the accused.
Conclusion
[109]                              I find the accused not guilty on all counts.
                                              B. SCHERMAN","HELD: The accused were each acquitted of all charges.
The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation.
The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him.
Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G.
The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer.","[563, 2, 1, 564, 562, 5, 9, 8, 550, 0, 555, 4, 7, 561, 556, 553, 560, 3, 551, 6, 548, 10, 11, 547]"

a.)       Restrict the accused’s Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food in the Jans Bay (Canoe Lake) geographical area as defined by the Saskatchewan regulation;
c.)       Infringe upon the accused’s Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food, as protected, recognized and affirmed by section 25 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The particulars of the challenge are as follows:
- That the accused is a status Treaty Indian, with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights to fish for sustenance;
It seems to be uncontroverted evidence that the accused was fishing for food.
[72]           In conclusion, the accused has failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him:
The challenged regulations are within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights;
2)       Alternatively the regulations are within the proviso of Treaty No. 10 and constitutional legislative enactments for “regulations to be made” by government; 
3)       Alternatively, if the regulations are not within the implied or express limitations of the right, evidence does not establish a prima facie infringement of the right;
4)       Alternatively, if there was a breach, said breach meets the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.
[73]           The Court finds the accused guilty as charged.
D.A. Lavoie, J","/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry.
The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food.
He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike.
The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish.
The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round.
The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence.
Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights.
The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing.
The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning.
He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing.
The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n
HELD: The accused was found guilty.
The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","[409, 407, 408, 50, 47, 404, 49, 406, 0, 405, 51, 53, 403]"

As a result, the trial of this matter was reconvened before myself, for a determination on the issue of the plaintiff’s claim for unpaid holiday pay.
                                                               ANALYSIS
         The onus and burden in a wrongful dismissal case rests with the plaintiff.
It is, of course, for a wronged plaintiff to prove his damages, and there is therefore a burden upon him to establish on a balance of probabilities what his loss is.
The parameters of loss are governed by legal principle.
The plaintiff must prove his entitlement to holiday pay in lieu of time off for the period of his employment and for the notice period damages awarded by the jury.
Unless the plaintiff demonstrates an actual loss occasioned by the loss of vacation entitlement, or evidence that he was entitled to take pay in lieu of the vacation, there should be no compensation for same and the plaintiff’s claim in that regard is not allowed.
The plaintiff here took his holidays each year and would likely have continued to do so had he continued in the employment of the defendant through the notice period.
The plaintiff is not entitled to any damages for holiday pay on the notice period.
         For the reasons stated, the plaintiff’s claim for holiday pay is dismissed with costs.","A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice.
The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs.
The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay.
HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.
 1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays.
The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA.
Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement.
Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date.
Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose.
4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax.
As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.
 5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year.
The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.
 6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus.
The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor.
The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent.
Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period.
The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose.
It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA.
Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime.
Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime.
The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","[381, 380, 379, 143, 22, 0, 145, 148, 146, 142, 378]"

HOUSTON Counsel: Michael A. Segu for Her Majesty The Queen William H. Roe, Q.C. for Simon M. Houston SENTENCE LAING C.J.Q.B. April 22, 2008 [1]
In the time in question Mr. Houston was active on a pedophile website dedicated to man-girl relationships.
The Crown evidence is that he had 1,200 postings on the website in this period, which included 11 stories that are the subject of the charge, and described sexual activity between adults and either infants or preteen girls.
In one posting on the website on June 18, 2005 he wrote:
That you not reside where such computer equipment or communication device is available.
That you attend sex offender treatment programming as directed to do so by the supervisor.
It is strongly recommended in the evidence that Mr. Houston would benefit from one-on-one individual counselling by a professional person appropriately trained in sex offender treatment.
Every effort should be made to facilitate such a program.
That you not communicate with any female person under the age of 18 years unless that person is in the company of an adult who is present during the communication.
The foregoing is the sentence imposed on you, Mr. Houston.                      C. J.Q.B. R.D. LAING","Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works.
The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls.
HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry.
The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem.
The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society.
For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles.
The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images.
The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world.
Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same.
2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it.
A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence.
Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","[126, 125, 2, 124, 122, 123, 3, 121, 5, 0]"

    It might be added that the quotation from Zimmerman relied on by the trial judge, and quoted above, itself says that a settlement should not be enforced by the court if it is ""obviously incomplete"".
    One final comment as to Zimmerman.
While these Rules may apply to some settlement agreements made during pre-trial conferences, they would not apply in most cases where agreement is reached by negotiation, rather than by formal written offers and acceptances in compliance with the Rules.
In the cases of negotiated settlements, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs.
    The appeal is therefore allowed.
There will be no order as to costs.

The wife appealed.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
 1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988]
1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings.
The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences.
2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded.
Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.
 3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear.
Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","[0, 85, 2, 84, 1, 83, 3, 82, 81, 4, 5, 6, 7, 78, 80, 79, 8, 9, 77, 11, 76, 10, 12, 74, 73]"

(Respondent/Applicant) APPELLANT
- and - 
(Applicant/Respondent) RESPONDENT
(We recognize that violations of collective agreements may also, on occasion, constitute unfair labour practices over which the Labour Relations Board has jurisdiction, but that does not change the principle.)
The power claimed for the Labour Relations Board to make interim orders in respect of proceedings before arbitration boards is inconsistent with that exclusivity even if used only to aid arbitration boards by supplying a power that the arbitration board itself may not have.
Nor is there anything in s. 25 or the other sections of the Act dealing with resolution of disputes by arbitration to indicate an intention to grant supervisory or other powers to the Labour Relations Board in  respect of the arbitration process.
Nor does s. 42 aid the appellant.
Whatever the scope of s. 42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the Labour Relations Board to act in respect of such matters.
The appeal is dismissed with costs in the usual way.","An appeal from an order which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board (LRB) pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the LRB and even though it had no power to make a final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board.
At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.
 1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question.
The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable.
2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.
 3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB.
The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","[52, 0, 1, 51, 50, 2, 49, 3, 4, 48, 47, 5, 7]"
947,"[4]      THE FACTS [5]
On  April 14, 1997 Sawkiw was in a motor  vehicle accident  and suffered soft tissue injuries to his  cervical spine.
His  vehicle was struck from behind by an  uninsured driver.
Sawkiw  is a farmer and pursuant  to  the  Act,  he received  a partial income replacement benefit from  SGI  on the  basis that he was not able to perform some but not  all of his farm duties.
In  all  of the circumstances,  the  court  is prepared  to  permit  him that review.
SGI  will  therefore arrange  for Sawkiw to forthwith be assessed by Wascana.
In this  regard, it is to be noted that under the terms of this judgment, Sawkiw's final income replacement benefit will  be an  income replacement benefit other than one made  pursuant to section 139 or 140.
[22]      COSTS [23]
Sawkiw  shall  be entitled to his  solicitor  and client  costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received.
He shall also be entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion  which  costs are set at $600.00  being  the  maximum amount   payable   under   The  Personal   Injury   Benefits Regulations.                                        J.L.G PRITCHARD, J.","An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits.
The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver.
He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties.
HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g).
SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances.
SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time.
It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting.
It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations.
He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit.
2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta.
However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work.
Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment.
3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith.
If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a).
Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received.
He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","[2, 129, 130, 3, 131, 126, 4, 5, 128, 125]"
948,"In the alternative the applicant seeks an order preventing the respondent from removing their daughter from the Province of Saskatchewan.
The application arises out of the respondent's declared intention to move to Kelowna, British Columbia.          The parties separated in October, 1994.
The daughter, Letitia, age 7, has been in the care of her mother (the respondent) since that time.
Under the terms of the consent judgment of May 2, 1995, the respondent has custody of Letitia.
The applicant has reasonable access at all reasonable times upon reasonable notice, including every second weekend and every Wednesday evening.          The respondent says, and the applicant did not take issue with the fact that she had always been the primary care giver.
However, in the circumstances of this case the factor does not outweigh other considerations.          The applicant's request for interim relief is denied.
The issue is whether there should be a variation of the custody provisions of the consent judgment.
A pre-trial conference should be scheduled upon the filing  of a joint request of the parties.
If the respondent proceeds with her move to Kelowna, a revision of the access provisions will be appropriate.
If the parties are unable to agree, an application may be made to the Court.
Costs are left to the trial judge.                                                      J.","An application to vary the terms of a 1995 consent judgment such that the applicant would have sole custody.
Alternatively he sought an order preventing the mother from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan.
The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion.
The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994.
The father had exercised regular and frequent access.
She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties.
Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home.
HELD: 1)Relocation was neither foreseen nor reasonably contemplated by the judge making the original order.
The threshold criteria was thus satisfied.
2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence.
The child had a close relationship with both parents.
The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed.
3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied.
If the mother proceeded with her move a revision of the access provision would be appropriate. 4)The child's best interest is the proper test to be applied (Cote) having regard to the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon.
5)The applicant became aware in early June of the mother's intention to move to British Columbia and did not object.
The timing of the application, a few weeks prior to the proposed move, raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application.

The further deductions to obtain the non-earner’s IRB is in keeping with his earning reality.
And, as I stated in the previous Montgrand  judgment, the legislation attempts to find the non-earner’s earning reality.
16)           Counsel for Montgrand also appealed SGI’s calculation of interest on monies owed to Montgrand on the basis of pre-judgment interest.
Counsel now concedes that SGI was correct in applying Regulation 102 which states, “Interest payable pursuant to Part VIII of the Act is to be calculated in accordance with The Pre-judgment Interest Act.”
17)           Counsel for Montgrand seeks solicitor and client costs for this proceeding.
It is agreed between counsel that Mr. Abrametz’s fee on a solicitor and client basis have been paid up to the conclusion of the appeal.
18)           Section 198 of the Act and Regulation 101 contemplate the payment of a claimant’s solicitor and client costs if the claimant is successful on appeal.
Because Montgrand has not been successful in this proceeding, he is not entitled to any more costs from SGI.

The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75.
The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act.
HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB.
It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners.
It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners.
All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident.

The Honourable Mr. Justice Cameron 
As might have been expected, nothing turned on the fact the notice did not arrive a day or two earlier, for the administrator and the board were still able to act upon it in accordance with the requirements of the statute.
This was especially so in the circumstances, for the assessment had not only been completed well in advance of May 31st but had been published several days beforehand, leaving ample time for the performance of these duties.
In conclusion, we are of the opinion that Wascana Energy exercised its right of appeal properly, or at least effectively, requiring the board of revision to entertain the appeal.
And so the appeal from the decision of the Committee will be allowed, with costs as usual, and there will be an order directing the board of revision to hear and determine the company's assessment appeal.

The Appeals Committee refused to direct the board of revision to hear the appeal on the basis the company failed to give notice within the period prescribed by s303(1) and concluded that the board did not have the power to extend the time.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The board of revision was directed to hear and determine the assessment appeal.
1)The Committee did not err in deciding the prescribed time period for an appeal could not be extended.
 2)The less formal expression 'to give notice to' as used in the Act is a less exacting term than 'to serve notice upon'.
Wascana Energy exercised its right of appeal properly, or at least effectively, requiring the board of revision to entertain the appeal.","[0, 130, 2, 128, 3, 1, 126, 124, 123, 6, 125, 8, 7, 4, 5, 120, 121]"

ANALYSIS OF ISSUES
5)               a) whether plaintiffs’ counsel, Merchant Law Group, (MLG) should be granted leave pursuit to Rule 317 to cross examine Sarah Moore on her affidavit sworn June 24, 2009;
6)               It is important to review how the Moore affidavit came to be.
Red Seal earlier sought to conduct examination of seven persons alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members in the proceeding against it (the Roussys and boyfriends ).
Red Seal alleges that these seven people had all ready entered into full and final settlements with it and are not therefore entitled to be part of the action against Red Seal.
7)               Mr. Justice Ottenbreit was the designated Justice of this action at that time.
Ottenbreit  J. delivered a judgment on the above issue on June 16, 2009.
Accordingly I am going to presume that counsel would have been able to proceed earlier.
70)              Therefore taking into consideration that this matter has been adjourned and  would have been done by now; it seems reasonable that there has to be a deadline to file amendments, briefs, or any other material.","Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated.
HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.
 1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant.
This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals.
The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue.
This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on.
The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do.
There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit.
In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed.
There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.
 2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients.
The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members.
However, that case is not similar to this case.
In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements.
Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's.
The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.'
As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act.
Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","[52, 49, 51, 0, 53, 55, 210, 48, 50, 54, 56, 208]"

What are the appropriate s. 7 Guideline expenses for Stephanie and how should these expenses be shared by Mr. Pilat and Ms. Lilley?
Should the child support variation in this matter be retroactive? and
Should costs of this application be granted to either Mr. Pilat or Ms. Lilley?
[4]               Before answering the above questions it is necessary to set out the history of this variation application and the factual context in which the questions above will be determined.
                                              HISTORY OF APPLICATION
In any event, the matter was brought back before me with the request that I now make a determination in this matter, based on all of the evidence filed.
         As set out previously, Mr. Pilat argues that his child support obligation for Stephanie should be based on a gross annual income in the sum of $21,000.00.
I am willing to grant her some costs as it is clear that the discovery motion which I heard in this matter would not have been necessary had Mr. Pilat provided appropriate financial disclosure.
Costs are awarded to Ms. Lilley in the sum of $750.00 payable forthwith.
                                                                ORDERS
(4)               Ms. Lilley shall have costs in this matter which are hereby set in the sum of $750.00 payable by Mr. Pilat forthwith.","FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter.
He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated.
HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest.
In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination.
Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment.
He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000.
The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year.
It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances.
The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable.
2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter.
3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income.
4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted.
The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.
 In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.
 5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith.
The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful.
Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax.
It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order.
The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure.
Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","[0, 128, 23, 1, 22, 123, 2, 21, 42, 3, 24, 122, 20, 121, 85]"

(e)        An Order that any maintenance for Keegan Strueby be paid directly to Keegan.
THE LAW
Step 3:  If the answer to Step 2 is “yes”, what level of support is “appropriate”?
ANALYSIS
Step 1 - Do the children remain children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act?
            Although initially the parties were at odds concerning all three children, by the time of their latest submissions, some consensus had been reached regarding two of the children.
Therefore, the arrears as of December 17, 2007 are $10,587.
            Mr. Strueby has also sought an order for an orderly payment of the arrears.
Based upon the financial information that he has provided, I set the amount that Mr. Strueby should pay towards the arrears at $200 per month until such time as Mr. Strueby is no longer paying child support for Keegan when the amount payable towards the arrears should increase to $500 per month.
CONCLUSION
There shall be a declaration that Jill, born December 16, 1981, is no longer a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act.
As success has been divided in respect to this application, there will be no order as to costs.
                                                                                                                N.G. GABRIELSON","FIAT: The parties have three children, Jill born December 1981, Luke born May 1986 and Keegan born November 1989.
The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own.
The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university.
The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order.
HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008.
The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university.
2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion.
Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","[111, 121, 12, 1, 81, 112, 110, 109, 120, 82, 11, 2, 20, 36, 108, 83, 79]"

HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS
[2]               The defendants entered into a mortgage with the plaintiff on April 14, 2005 for land described as:  Lot 4, Block 17, Plan No. 85SC07177, Extension 0, Burstall, SK.
The mortgage was renewed for 2 year period with a maturity date of March 14, 2008.
[4]               On March 20, 2008, the plaintiff applied ex parte for an appointment for a hearing of an application pursuant to the Act for leave to commence an action.

957,"The defendant ""SaskPower"" seeks an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 requiring the plaintiffs to post security for its costs in this action, on the ground:          . . . that Wind Power Inc. is a non-          resident plaintiff with little or no          assets in the province of Saskatchewan and          Dove Industries, Inc., while a corporation          in the province of Saskatchewan, was          incorporated specifically for a wind power          demonstration project which did not          proceed (and which is related to the          subject matter of this action) and          accordingly has little or no assets in the          province.
[2]      Rule 547 reads in part:          547(1)
The question arises whether this Court has jurisdiction to direct security in the present circumstances and, if so, whether it should do so.
See Perentes et al. v. Cordogianes Estate et al. (1985), 1984 CanLII 2232 (SK QB), 36 Sask. R. 159 (Q.B.).
Again, the time to have brought the application was at least soon after September, 1996.
The fact that it was not made until now would have left the plaintiffs with the distinct possibility that, ultimately, the court was not going to be asked by SaskPower to have them furnish security.
In my judgment, there are ""appropriate circumstances"", per Grotsky J. in Thole v. McKenna, supra, to deny the defendant an order that the plaintiffs post security for costs at this stage of the action.
In the exercise of my discretion, I would dismiss SaskPower's motion.
The plaintiff shall have one set of costs of the application in any event of the cause.","FIAT. SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan.
HELD: The motion was dismissed.
 1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply.
Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan.
Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application.
The action was commenced in April 1996.
Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order.
To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.
 3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","[92, 91, 2, 90, 89, 4, 87, 88, 1]"

BACKGROUND FACTS [2]
The accused`s first appearance on the charge was January 20, 1997.
At that time he was remanded to January 24 by consent at his request, and then further remanded by consent to January 27, 1997 for a show cause hearing.
No evidence was offered by the accused of stress or damage to his reputation, and in fact arguably the evidence he did give suggested his reputation was not affected at all by the charge he was facing.
The prejudice he described of individual stress and family stress over the eventual outcome of the charge is the expected and normal prejudice faced by every person charged with an offence.
The absence of any special prejudice again causes me to describe the prejudice to his security interest as minor.
CONCLUSION [19]
Taking the foregoing factors into account I conclude the delay in the circumstances outlined above was not unreasonable.
Further, and in any event, the minor prejudice suffered by the accused beyond the expected and normal is not sufficient to outweigh society`s interest in bringing those charged with criminal offences to trial.

HELD: The application was dismissed.
The delay was not unreasonable.
 1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay.
Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest.
The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay.
His right to security of person and to liberty were not affected.
3)Seven months delay was due to scheduling delays resulting from defence's application to remove prosecution counsel who had previously represented the accused.
The Crown acted in good faith in opposing the application and had a meritorious position.
4)All other proceedings were within the systemic guidelines.
5)Prejudice to his liberty was minor as he was on bail since shortly after his arrest.
He was able to make full answer and defence.
He was employed throughout since his release.
His inability to enter long term contracts or travel out of province would have existed for 21-1/2 months of the 25 month delay in any event. 6)Individual and family stress is to be expected.

959,"The Crown seeks to use her prior statement, not only for the purposes of impeaching her credibility at trial, but also as substantive evidence that may be left with the jury at the end of the trial.
In particular, the oath was not administered prior to the taking of the statement, and there was no warning provided at that time, of the perjury consequences of not telling the truth.
She had been under surveillance, and the arrest was planned.
She was given the standard police cautions and her rights with respect to legal counsel upon her arrest.
(3)She stated that most of the time she received the cocaine at 1901 - 22nd Street West from Thong Nguyen.
(4)She indicated she would travel to pick up the cocaine by taxi.
(5)She stated she would deliver the cocaine to 1111 - 23rd Street West.
Independent surveillance evidence confirms this.
The foregoing independent evidence does not corroborate every aspect of Annette Cook's statement, but does so sufficiently, in enough different particulars, that I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that her statement, but for the demonstrably false portion, meets the threshold of reliability.          It follows that Annette Cook's prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents.
It will be for the jury to decide after receiving appropriate instructions with respect to the evidence of an accomplice, and the evidence of a person who has provided inconsistent testimony, what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept.                                                             J.","FIAT.

The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B.
HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents.
It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept.
1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established.
When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established.
The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability.
When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable.
2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","[1, 3, 138, 141, 136, 7, 6, 139, 134, 140]"

One way that contradictory evidence can be decided in the absence of cross-examination, is where for the purposes of the application the Court accepts the defendant’s evidence wherever it conflicts with that of the plaintiff and still concludes the plaintiff is entitled to judgment.
The analogy is the law related to the striking of a pleading for disclosing no reasonable cause of action or defence (Rule 173(a)) where the Court must assume any allegation of fact to be true.
If the Court can assume the defendant’s evidence is true and still grant summary judgment, there is no genuine need for a trial.
Such is the case in this matter.
THE PERIOD OF REASONABLE NOTICE
            As noted above, the plaintiff did receive six weeks’ notice of his termination or pay in lieu thereof (it is not altogether clear whether he worked at all during this period).
The defendant did not seriously argue, despite its pleading to this effect, that six weeks’ notice is adequate for a person terminated from a junior managerial position after a period of six and one-half years of employment.
Taking all factors into account, I consider this is an appropriate notice period to which the plaintiff was entitled.
            The plaintiff’s damages are to be calculated in the manner set out in the foregoing.
            The plaintiff is entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause.
The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager.
When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff.
It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination.
There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay.
The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court.
HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment.
Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b).
The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so.
If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact.
The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons.
The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer.
The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function.
'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace.
The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'.
The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings.
3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.
 4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","[151, 30, 0, 29, 1, 134, 135, 150, 28, 2, 136, 149, 27]"

CAMERON J.A.
      Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent’s first drug offence and she had no record of violence.
      With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order.
The error lay in the judge’s failure to have regard for the offender’s record as a whole—she has 53 prior convictions—and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs (2001), 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON CA), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.).
In light of the nature of the respondent’s current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made.
Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent.

On Appeal From:   QB 1418/95 Judicial Centre of Saskatoon
Having given the issue this consideration I conclude that it is only the first alternative that could support the contention that Royal’s policy provides coverage  and I cannot accept that it represents a strong enough argument to provide a basis  for the order sought by Guardian.
I am not prepared to accept that this policy should be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.
Before concluding, I add that I am largely in agreement with the view of this matter taken by the chamber judge.
Having done that, it seems useful to add my views as expressed in this judgment.
In the result, the appeal is dismissed with costs on double column V.
WAKELING J.A.
I concur                       . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
JACKSON J.A.","Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg.
Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage.
Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident.
Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles.
It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate.
HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy.
Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend.
Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify.
When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in.
The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'.
To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy.
The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision.
He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit.
CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.
 1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.
To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to.
There were inconsistencies in terminology.
The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","[359, 6, 1, 356, 7, 3, 363, 358, 9, 362, 361, 12, 15, 8, 13, 10, 355, 2, 5, 11, 4, 354]"

ORAL JUDGMENT                                                                                               POPESCUL J.
(a) to prevent the commission of an offence
(i) for which, if it were committed, the person who committed it might be arrested without warrant, and
            In this case, Demeria obviously came to the aid of an individual who was being stabbed repeatedly.
Consequently, I find that Demeria was clothed in legal justification when he entered the fray.
In response, Knife turned his attention to Demeria and assaulted him.
I find, as well, that Knife is not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because Knife provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to enable him to defend himself.
            As a result, I find that all of the elements of the common assault offence have also been made out by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt.
Conclusion
            In the final analysis, I find that the Crown has made out all of the elements of both counts beyond a reasonable doubt and, therefore, find Frederick Junior Knife guilty of both Count 1 and Count 2 as specified in the indictment.
                                                    M.D. Popescul","In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary.
The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon.
second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant.
The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured.
The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant.
None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused.
The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day.
The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code.
HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts.
1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances.
Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate.
Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option.
The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them.
2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge.
Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant.
The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","[377, 371, 380, 373, 374, 375, 378, 1, 2, 368, 4, 8, 5, 7, 367, 0, 379]"

                                        PARTNERSHIP FARM EQUIPMENT
 [29]               The respondent and Colin operate the farm in a partnership with the equipment being owned equally by them except for the part which is estate equipment.
There are a couple of major differences.
The first relates to the TR97 combine with header.
Mr. White values it at $109,000.00 which Mr. Hodgins values it at $84,000.00 (including the second header).
Again in this respect I prefer the appraisal of Mr. Hodgins.
In all other respects I accept the appraisal of Mr. White.
Description
These assets are found on Exhibit P-6.
No evidence was given with respect to the value of the pots and pans, children's toys or the bedroom suite ordered transferred by Kyle J. to the petitioner.
The judgment shall be a charge on the respondent's personal land.
 [44]               There are no costs awarded to either party and each must pay his or her own costs.
 [45]               In the event the respondent fails to pay the amount of the loan secured by the van now in the possession of the petitioner, the petitioner may apply for judgment against the respondent for the amount remaining unpaid.","Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties.
Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined.
HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.
 2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old.
The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year.
The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes.
Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines.
The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon.
The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children.
One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children.
4)Spousal support was not ordered.
The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future.
Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same.
5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal.
Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000.
There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops.
6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs.
The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land.
The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","[139, 0, 32, 299, 142, 298, 1, 143, 140, 292, 31, 2, 147, 296, 148, 144, 151, 300]"

On Appeal From:                  QB 4525/91 J.C. Regina
We are not persuaded by these arguments.
Foster's case was decided on its own facts, and on the facts in this case we are satisfied that the trial judge erred.
Bearing in mind Mr. Larsen's duty to STC to mitigate his loss, and having regard for all of the circumstances surrounding this matter, the trial judge ought to have found that Mr. Larsen had in fact managed to mitigate his loss.
There is simply no sound reason for holding otherwise.
That leaves only the extent of the mitigation.
And so we have decided to reduce his damages by some $16,000 to $17,000.
Let us say $16,500.
It follows, then, that the appeal will be allowed to the extent of reducing this head of damages from $165,000 to $148,500.
Otherwise the judgment at trial will stand.
There will be no order for costs on the appeal.","On appeal from 106 SaskR 277.

He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years.
On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high.

The  claim of the Michaluks is for $58,720.34.
This sum  represents  amounts outstanding on a failed  agreement and  lease  of the Michaluk's property in Manitoba  to  the bankrupt.
The  claims of these two creditors represent the vast majority   of  claims  of  unsecured  creditors   in   this bankruptcy.
The  bankrupt's position is that the bulk of the debt was  incurred  as  a result of the failure  of  his  former business, Red Bull Enterprises Ltd.  He contends  that  the failure  was  caused  by  a  protracted  dispute  with  the Department of Highways over the right of Red Bull to occupy land  owned by Highways.
The causes  of  bankruptcy  as set out in  the  Section  170(1) report  are ""Failure of business.
The  conclusion was  that  the  evidence  would not  support  a  successful prosecution.
In  conclusion there will be a conditional  order  of discharge requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750.00 from  any source to the trustee.
The bankrupt may pay this amount by monthly instalments of $100.00 per month commencing May  1, 1998  and  continuing on the 1st of each  succeeding  month until  paid in full.

Registrar in Bankruptcy","Revenue Canada, which was owed $166,359.72 for goods and services tax for 1991-92 and $14,223.30 for 1991 unpaid personal income tax, and the Michaluks, who were owed $58,720.34 for a failed agreement and lease on their property in Manitoba, objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt.
The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder.
The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter.
HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month.
Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.
 1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin.
The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable.
The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings.
The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings.
2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved.
It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action.
The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution.","[85, 84, 83, 82, 81, 4, 3, 2, 80, 1, 79, 8, 78, 5]"

             Having reviewed all of the pleadings and particularly the third party claim I accept that the applicant has made out a prima facie claim against the proposed third party.
There is no prejudice to the plaintiff, for whom no one appeared on this application, as the court has been advised that the plaintiff has settled with its insurer who is requesting settlement from the defendant’s insured.
I am satisfied there is a causal connection which exists between the cause of action pleaded in the statement of claim and the cause of action plead in the third party notice.
I am also aware that s. 308 of The Cities Act may be an absolute defence to the City.
However as stated by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in MacPherson Engineering Inc., supra, the application is purely one of procedure and no substantive rights between the parties can be determined on it.

The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage caused to a construction site under a bridge in Saskatoon.
The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit.
The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of.
HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted.
The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party.
There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer.
There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice.
It is immaterial at this stage that the City may have an absolute defence.","[74, 73, 0, 1, 72, 2, 71, 69, 70, 3, 5, 4, 68, 67]"

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN
APPELLANT
- and - 
CORY MICHAEL HERZBERG
RESPONDENT
Every individual charged with a criminal offence is guaranteed the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.
Although it is the responsibility of the presiding judge to ensure a fair hearing, there is no law which guarantees that inadvertent, inadmissible evidence will not be introduced.
If an error of that nature should occur, the error should be ignored, or, if it is deemed too significant to be ignored, a mistrial should be declared, permitting a new hearing which will contain no record of the inadvertent error.
If that is the proper procedure, it necessarily follows that the accused's rights, as guaranteed by the Charter are not violated when the inadvertent error occurs.
In this case, when the matter was raised with the trial judge, she said that she had not read the record, that she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings, and that the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible.
In these circumstances she was correct to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recuse herself.
The appeal is allowed, the order for prohibition is quashed, and the matter is remitted to the Provincial Court for trial.","The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure.
In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit.
The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her.
The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial.
There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused.
The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point.
The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible.
She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself.","[1, 67, 2, 66, 64, 4, 3, 63, 62, 5, 61, 6, 7, 65]"

SUMMARY
(i)  Date of swearing the Information to latest trial date - two years, seven months.
ANALYSIS
(a) Length of delay;
(b) Waiver of time period;
(c) Reasons for the delay, including:
The Crown further argues that stress and frustration are irrelevant and are part of the usual effects of being subject to a criminal charge.
The accused argues that she was reluctant to make further applications to amend her release conditions given the amendments she had already obtained to improve her job opportunities.
I find that in this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice and that the delay in bringing this matter to court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused’s ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial.
While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, I find that these could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release.
Given the finding of actual prejudice, the question remains as to whether the prejudice to the accused was such as to outweigh the prejudice to society that would result if the accused was not to face trial for this charge.
The just and appropriate remedy under section 24 of the Charter is to grant a stay of proceedings.","The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time.
HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.
 1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months.
The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable.
This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused.
6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court.
The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused.
3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial.
While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release.
4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached.
No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","[98, 92, 2, 1, 42, 90, 41, 44, 4, 88, 45, 87, 31, 8, 46, 89]"

April 11, 2005
I. INTRODUCTION
This offence is in effect careless driving, as distinguished from dangerous driving under the Criminal Code.
[2]             At trial, the Crown called three witnesses: Rebecca Banga, Justin Banga and Lance Kuchar.
Viewed objectively, and before considering any explanation from and on behalf of Mr. Tynadall, I am satisfied that this driving was careless.
The second part of the Sault Ste. Marie test is whether Mr. Tyndall has shown, on a balance of probabilities, that he exercised due diligence, or took reasonable care, on this date.
Based on his evidence, and the findings of fact I have made, I am so satisfied.
In conclusion, I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that, given the situation Mr. Tyndall found himself in, he could not have reasonably anticipated that a person would have been so close in front of him, and further that Mr. Tyndall did exercise due diligence both before and after striking Mr. Kachur.
As a result I find him not guilty of this charge.
Dated at Yorkton, Saskatchewan, on this 11th day of April, 2005.
GREEN, R.G., PCJ","The accused is charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act.
A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward.
HELD: The accused is not guilty.
The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian.
The accused did exercise due diligence.","[116, 115, 4, 3, 114, 6, 5, 7, 8, 113, 109, 110, 111, 9, 11, 12]"

[2]               And further, that between January 1, 1989 and December 31, 1991, at Willow Bunch, Saskatchewan and Winnipeg, Manitoba, did commit sexual assaults on Nicole Eger, contrary to provisions of the Criminal Code.
[3]               Mr. Therrien, with the advice of counsel, elected to be tried in this Court and entered guilty pleas on August 10, 2011.
Counsel advised at that time that there was a significant divergence on some of the facts.
The Crown requested a sentencing hearing pursuant to section 724(3)(e).
The accused agreed.
Mr. Therrien admitted on cross-examination that it is possible he was sexually aroused.
[52]           I believe Mr. Therrien, when he testified that he cannot remember these incidents.
He may well have repressed these incidents.
Considering the allegations now, as a man in his eighties, he of course cannot or will not believe he would have done such things.
[53]           In summary, I find that the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt the three facts that I find to be aggravating factors pursuant to section 724(3)(e) of the Criminal Code.
Dated at Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, this 30th day of March, 2012.
M.T. Gordon, J","The accused plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault.
The victims were his granddaughters.
The assaults were alleged to have occurred between 1983 and 1991.
A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts.
The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims.
HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.
The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years.
The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters.
The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim.
Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","[161, 12, 11, 156, 158, 14, 8, 157, 0, 159, 155, 16, 160, 15]"

[2]                  Cst. Rozario testified that he was on patrol in the Paddockwood District, Saskatchewan, on the date in question with a “ride along”.
He testified that the “ride along” had no duties and was simply with him.
He chose not to disclose in his disclosure information the name of the “ride along” nor even that there was a ride along.
He had to use his prescribed inhaler then and again at the party where he had had his two or three beer.
I do not conclude in any manner that this was indeed the reason why there was difficulties for the accused to blow into the machine.
It is his attempt, I think, to explain to himself why things did not work on the night in question.
I do not place any emphasis on this as being the reason for his failure to provide an adequate sample as more evidence would have to have been called in this regard for me to draw such a conclusion.

HELD: The accused was found not guilty.
The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused.
The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance.
The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample.
There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.","[83, 3, 94, 0, 84, 12, 14, 81, 13, 80, 93, 15, 79, 82]"

Finally, the Court notes that it was [T.D.] who showed J.M. how to breach a vehicle's ignition.
Taking these matters into account and weighing what was said in R. v. B. (S.) et al., a fit disposition for the offences prior to June 21, 1994 would be four months open custody.

And it is for that reason that I make this request at that time -- at this time. (pp. 19-20)
            The defence was ready to proceed with the preliminary hearing on September 29.
            In Canada, an accused person is presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.
In reality, this fundamental principle is often overlooked by the public and especially in highly publicized cases where a public figure is involved.
Here, as a result of the Crown’s unexplained delay in providing disclosure, Mr. Cote will have endured an unnecessary additional nine months of unemployment, economic hardship and other  prejudice in the form of embarrassment from the numerous media reports of the charges.
And, this occurred notwithstanding that Mr. Cote did everything in his power not to have the process delayed.
On balance, as indicated, the prejudice occasioned by this delay outweighs the interest of society in bringing Mr. Cote to trial.
There will therefore be an order directing a stay of the charge in the indictment dated June 28, 1999 that was filed June 29, 1999.","The accused, Cote, applied for remedy pursuant to s.24 of the Charter of Rights stating that he was denied the right to be tried on a fraud charge within a reasonable time.
Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date.
Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial.
The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure.
HELD: The charge was stayed.
In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry.
This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay.
Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time.
Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay.
He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship.
The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay.
Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.","[181, 180, 1, 0, 179, 177, 2, 176, 4, 174, 3, 5, 173, 7, 10, 178]"

The charge arises out of an altercation which occurred at Uncle Charlie's Bar December 14, 1997, in which Baikie suffered significant injuries about the head and face.
The events surrounding the altercation were described by three Crown witnesses, and by five defence witnesses including the accused.
As is usually the case, there are discrepancies.
The accused admits that he threw a punch but says that Baikie struck him first.
Layman was simply attempting to prevent Baikie from getting involved in a fight with the accused.
16      I do not accept the argument that the accused was acting in self defence.
Even if he was, he used more force than was necessary.
Neither Section 34 or Section 37 of the Criminal Code justifies the assault.
I find that the accused did assault Jason Baikie and did thereby cause bodily harm to him.
I find him guilty.

HELD: The accused was found guilty.
1)The self-defence argument was not accepted.
Neither s.34 or s.37 of the Criminal Code justified the assault.
2)The testimony of the Crown witnesses was accepted.

March 9, 1995
   Order that the agreed statement of facts on pp.2 and 3 of the
judgment dated February 6, 1995, not be published nor broadcast in
any manner.","The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer.
They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code.
The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial.
At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter.
The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter.
HELD: Application allowed in part.
 1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society.
While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective.
S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused.
They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence.
The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true.
S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid.

[8]            I agree with Fleury’s counsel that the learned trial judge erred in concluding that the only direction that Fleury could have come from was Highway #11, thus driving through the intersection at a high speed without stopping at the stop sign.
[9]            Because the Crown’s evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, it has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.

A. R. Rothery","The appellant appeals his conviction of dangerous driving.
The police did not see the appellant driving; they came across his minivan immersed in a slough in excess of 35 feet off the highway.
Based on the tire tracks, the appellant was charged with dangerous driving.
The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.
The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign.
In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described.
HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.

Richard Howard Williams on his own behalf
The proper income for the appellant was still in the neighbourhood of $30,000.
He also still had the same medical issues and the couples’ daughter Catherine was still living with him and going to university full time.
The order of the chambers judge was based solely on a calculation of the parties’ respective incomes, as found or imputed.
The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining Catherine on the basis that she was over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student.
It is clear that Ottenbreit J. set an order for a fixed and short term in order to give the respondent an opportunity to find appropriate employment and become self sufficient.
It is our view that, in this circumstance, it was incumbent on the respondent on the review application to establish that she was unable to become self sufficient.
The order of Sandomirsky J. is set aside, the respondent’s application for spousal support is dismissed and the order against the appellant for costs below is set aside.","The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year.
The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation.
They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant.
Both parties have some health problems.
Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year.
Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible.
The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment.
She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica.
She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced.
HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside.
The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage.
He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment.
The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant.
He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student.
It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient.
The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","[0, 2, 1, 3, 84, 86, 83, 4, 5, 6, 7, 81, 8, 80, 78, 79]"

From:               Pursuant to the Extradition Act, S.C. 1999, c. 18
Furthermore, it is a fact that he failed to abide by the terms of his Romanian community-based sentence and has not satisfied the compensation judgment awarded against him.
In this respect, all of Romania’s points are well-made in that these facts do serve to elevate the risk of Mr. Cretu’s non-appearance.
These considerations are met, to some degree, by Mr. Cretu’s compliance with his 2004 release conditions and his connections to this jurisdiction.
In this respect, although I reject Romania’s characterisation of Mr. Cretu’s ties to the community as being “minimal”, neither are they great.
Put simply, Mr. Cretu has not established that he will surrender himself into custody were I to release him.
In light of my conclusion under s. 679(3)(b), there is no reason to consider the third test under s. 679(3)(c). 
I hereby dismiss Mr. Cretu’s application for interim judicial release.
      DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 28th day of June, A.D. 2012.
                                     Caldwell J.A.","The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code.
Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him.
The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond.
The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property.
HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous,
the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant.
The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence.
Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada.
The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court.
The application for judicial interim release was dismissed.","[138, 0, 140, 135, 137, 5, 139, 2, 1, 3, 131, 133, 4, 6, 128, 129, 10]"

ORDERS
            Solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000 claimed by the applicant are not appropriate here.
The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous.
The respondent’s unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit the censure of the Court through full solicitor and client costs.
            In addition, the applicant’s conduct was not entirely pure.
In Delaire v. Delaire, 1996 CanLII 6752 (SK QB), [1996]
9 W.W.R. 469, 147 Sask. R. 161 (Q.B.), the Court held that the debt created by judgment is a debt due and payable as of the date of pronouncement and that collection proceedings may be properly taken before formal judgment is entered.
This general principle is applicable here.
The judgment of March 19, 1999 created a debt owing to the applicant from the respondent and the debt became due and payable on the date of pronouncement, being March 19, 1999.
The Executions Act states that interest runs “from the time of entering judgment” and not from the time of entering formal judgment.
            Therefore, I order that the respondent pay to the applicant post-judgment interest at a rate of five percent per annum from the date judgment was pronounced, being March 19, 1999, in accordance with s. 30 of The Executions Act, and until judgment is satisfied.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs.
At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs.
The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs.
Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties.
Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial.
The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000.
The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial.
The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate.
The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers.
HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case.
The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure.
The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance.
In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate.
Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances.
The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous.
The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs.
The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","[0, 59, 98, 3, 99, 58, 97, 60, 61, 96, 62, 94, 95]"

Mr. K.W. MacKay, Q.C. for the Crown
The Respondent in Person
On Appeal From:      Provincial Court
She was of the view a community disposition was likely to be more effective than incarceration at rehabilitating the respondent.
We are all of the view the Crown’s appeal must be allowed.
A conditional sentence was not available in these circumstances.
The sentencing judge acknowledged it was easy to understand the position taken by the Crown when the Crown asked for a penitentiary sentence.
The judge ignored the danger to the community presented by the respondent.
The respondent had no sooner finished his parole when he began to commit the subject offences.
As well, the judge, in our view, failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all of the protection of the public.
The circumstances and the respondent’s lengthy record require a penitentiary term be imposed (see R. v. Prendenchuk[1]).
However we have considered the time already spent on electronic monitoring and the post–sentence efforts of the respondent to change and simply remove the conditional provision imposed below.","The Crown appealed a conditional sentence of 2 years less a day imposed after the respondent pled guilty to three break and enters of dwelling houses and theft and possession of stolen property in February and March as well as two breaches of undertakings in March and June 2000.
HELD: The conditional provision was removed as time spent on electronic monitoring and post sentence efforts were considered.
A conditional sentence was not available in the circumstances.
The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions.
The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public.
The respondent had no sooner finished parole than he began to commit these crimes.","[1, 37, 2, 36, 3, 35, 4, 34, 33, 5, 32, 6, 31, 7, 8, 30, 9, 10, 29]"

[4]               Brooks has, in effect, applied pursuant to s. 20(4) of the Act for an order declaring that her interest in the Lincoln is not affected by any forfeiture order.
                                        ALLEGED CHARTER VIOLATIONS
         Section 11(d) of the Charter states""
11         Any person charged with an offence has the right
(d)        to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal;
         If relief from forfeiture was only available upon proof, by some standard, of innocence of complicity in the offence, forfeiture might then be deemed to be cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.
But it is only necessary to satisfy a judge that the applicant is ""apparently innocent"" to avoid forfeiture.
[38]              In view of the provisions available in the Act to obtain an order of relief from forfeiture, it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel and unusual treatment or punishment of any person who may have an interest in the property sought to be forfeited.
Consequently, the application of Brooks must be dismissed and an order of forfeiture will issue pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Act.","The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act.
The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order.
The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln.
She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking.
The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking.
The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed.
HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1).
The application for relief was dismissed.
1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20.
2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence.
3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence.
There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here).
The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary.
In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","[145, 0, 97, 98, 143, 99, 1, 20, 142, 100, 144]"

He refers to the recent crimes committed at a La Ronge area motel, a robbery at a local financial institution, and the present matter.
A knowledgeable and responsible member of the public will be aware that there is no apparent or suggested connection between the three incidents referred to by the Crown, and that the offender in one of the incidents has been apprehended, has pleaded guilty, and has been remanded pending sentence.
I believe that the public will recognize that the previous two matters, while deeply disturbing to the community, are not related to the present charges or accused youth in any way.
I do not agree that the release of this youth will create a lack of confidence in the administration of justice because of the occurrence of unrelated crimes by unrelated persons.
I will release the youth on strict conditions which will continue until her trial is completed.
Dated at La Ronge, Saskatchewan, the 5th day of May, 2006.
Wilfrid K. Tucker
Judge of the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan","The Crown asks that the accused youth be detained.
The Crown concedes that there is no reason to detain the accused youth to ensure her attendance in court or to prevent further occurrences.
The Crown asks that she be detained because the crime is so horrible, the case is so strong and the public in La Ronge are so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence in the administration of justice.
HELD: The court does not keep a person in custody simply because they are accused of committing an offence.
There must be a necessary and substantial reason to keep a person in custody before they have a trial.
The accused youth will be released on strict conditions that will continue until her trial is complete.","[1, 31, 30, 2, 3, 29, 28, 4, 27, 5, 6, 26, 7, 25, 8, 24]"

RESPONDENT
Mr. D.M. Brown, Q.C. for the Crown
Mr. Reg Watson for the Respondent
The sentence does not reflect the gravity of the offences, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such activities, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public.
The trial judge further erred in first failing to determine whether a penitentiary term was appropriate.
A conviction for either offence could lead to a penitentiary term given the respondent’s record and his repeated failure to obey court imposed conditions.
This court has often expressed its condemnation of these activities and in particular its condemnation of home invasion robberies and the robberies of highly vulnerable businesses.
The public must be protected from this type of criminal behaviour and a more severe sentence is called for.
The appeal is therefore allowed, the sentence imposed below set aside and a sentence of four years imprisonment from this date on each charge to be served concurrently is hereby imposed.
This sentence takes into account the time the respondent served both on remand and on electronic monitoring.
[2](1996), 1996 CanLII 4934 (SK CA), 137 Sask. R. 306.
[4](2000), 2000 SKCA 49 (CanLII), 189 Sask. R. 291.","The Crown sought leave to appeal a conditional sentence of 9 months of time served plus 2 years less 1 day, including 3 months on electronic monitoring, and 2 years probation with a 10 year firearm prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently.
The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation.
The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence.
The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers.
The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims.
The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences.
HELD: Leave was granted.
The appeal was allowed.
The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring.
The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed.
The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public.
A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances.
He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times.
He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment.","[1, 52, 2, 51, 50, 3, 4, 49, 48, 5, 6, 47, 46, 7, 45, 8, 9, 44]"

4)              Requiring the respondent to pay to the petitioner, as maintenance for the child, Brady Melvin, in accordance with the Guidelines, the sum of $1,076.00 per month.
5)              Requiring the respondent to pay to the petitioner 88% of the hockey expenses incurred on behalf of the child from August 1, 2003, to August 1, 2004, which expenses total $3,900.00, and to pay to the petitioner 88% of the child's hockey expenses thereafter upon being provided with proof of payment of such expenses.

material change in circumstance such that the issue of child support ought to be revisited.
In this regard it is noted that the respondent provided no evidence as to the amount, the method or when his father provided him with ""gifts"" as he describes them.
The allegation is that he has received no gifts since then and his mother is not able to afford to help him.
Without evidence of the earlier gifts there is no means of comparing the present circumstance to the past.
The respondent says his mother does not have the means but there is no evidence in this regard.
The situation is somewhat akin to that where a payor, particularly the self-employed, claim his or her income has changed substantially.
The onus is on the individual to provide cogent, and where possible, independent or objective verification of the change of circumstances.
This application was brought just ten months after the pre-trial conference.
The material does not satisfy the Court there has been any material change in the respondent's circumstances.
 [14]               The application is dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed in the amount of $1,000.00.","The mother had custody of the 12 and year olds under the terms of the January 10, 2000 consent judgment.
The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000.
The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances.
This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference.
It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service.
There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule.
The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends.
The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times.
This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","[120, 121, 0, 2, 1, 119, 118, 116, 3, 117, 4, 115, 6, 5, 112, 7, 114, 111]"

The plaintiff’s case as it relates to the claims for bonus payments is dismissed.
The plaintiff also claimed the sum of $900.00 as payment for the balance of the cost of feed for the year 2005-2006.
Dobson testified that he agreed that he owed eight to nine hundred dollars to Benson.
The Court has no way of accurately determining whether the figure should be $800.00 or $900.00 because the plaintiff did not have a copy of the final invoice given to Dobson and he, Dobson, did not bring a copy of that bill with him to Court.
Because the parties are so close in their estimate as to the amount of the final cost of the feed, I find that the defendant owes the plaintiff $850.00 and judgment shall issue accordingly.
Because each of the parties were partially successful, there will be no order as to costs.

The amount of the bonus was left blank.
The plaintiff sues the defendant, claiming a bonus for the 2004-2005 year and the 2005-2006 year.

In law an agreement to come to an agreement is not enforceable.
This is especially true where an essential term regarding remuneration has not been agreed to.

The father of these two children is intermittently involved in their lives.
Lawrence has previously shown himself to be ineffectual in attempting to harmonize the relationship between the children of two families.
None of the evidence suggests that Lawrence will be more successful in harmonizing the complex relationships that will exist among his and Brenda’s two daughters, Brenda’s two children, and Trista.
39)              Trista has already had to contend with multiple “fathers” and multiple “siblings”, many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life.
The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what “family” means.
No good can come of that, and I cannot conclude that it would be in her best interests to expect it of her.
Access to Lawrence is not in the best interests of Trista.
V.      Conclusion
40)              Lawrence’s application for access is dismissed.
However, in the circumstances of this cases, there will be no order for costs.
                                                                                                    M-E. Wright   ","The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married.
The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship.
The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to.
There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children.
The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997.
HELD: The application for access is dismissed.
In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child.
The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life.
The community viewed them generally as father and daughter.
However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her.
This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life.
The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means.
Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","[258, 260, 256, 257, 253, 1, 254, 2, 6, 255, 0, 4, 259, 5, 251, 7, 8, 250, 252]"

The parties both seek custody of their only child born in October 1997.
The issues before the court is interim custody and primary residence of the child, access by the other parent and interim child maintenance.
The parties filed evidence that was considerably contradictory relating to each other and respective abilities as parent.
viva voce hearing was held to assist determining the questions of credibility.
The mother aged 31 years of age, is employed as secretary.
The mother remained at home during the first year of the child's birth then returned to work.
The mother suffered from post partum depression following the child's birth and as result attempted to commit suicide.
She was hospitalized for three weeks to receive psychiatric assistance.
The psychiatrist who treated the mother states the mother is unlikely to have future suicide attempts and has responded well to treatment.
The child was with the mother every afternoon during her hospitalization and the mother bonded with her son.
The father is currently employed at Ipsco on shift work and is currently living with his parents.
The father has had the child since the separation and the child has had little access with his mother.
HELD: The child's primary residence should be with the mother.
Based on the information before the Court, the mother has always been the primary caregiver of the child and remained at home with the child for the first year of his life.
The mother was responsible for the child's day to day needs, health care and child care.
As well the father asserts that he was involved in the child's health care needs but was unable to name the child's pediatrician.
The father will have access to the child for three days when he is not working including overnight access.

IN THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH
Here the defendants have consistently attempted to improperly thwart at every turn the efforts of the plaintiff to determine the matters raised in these lawsuits.
If such person is not acceptable to the plaintiff, the plaintiff may make a court application for the designation of the proper officer.
In view of the past abuses, the defendants shall not be entitled to any conduct money for the initial attendances at the examinations for discovery or for any subsequent attendances required for the completion  of the examinations.
(3)The defendants shall serve and file their statements as to documents within 14 days of the date of this order.
(4)The plaintiff shall have its costs of these applications in any event of the cause.
I fix these costs at $1,000.00 against the corporate defendant and $500.00 against the individual defendant.
The costs shall be paid by the defendants to the plaintiff within 14 days of the date of this order.
If a defendant fails to comply with the terms of this order, the plaintiff may apply to this Court to have that defaulting defendant's defence struck out.","The plaintiff applied under Queen's Bench Rule 231 to strike the statements of defence of a corporate and individual defendant for failure to attend scheduled examinations despite service of an appointment and payment of conduct money to their solicitor.
The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences.
Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution.
Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend.
The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer.
This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants.
The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors.
HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply.
He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates.
Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","[128, 127, 0, 125, 3, 124, 1, 126, 123, 6, 2, 120, 7, 4, 5, 118]"

(ix)     The house was not of quality construction.
The claim for breach of contract has its foundation in the lack of disclosure provided by Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski when completing the PCDS.
In this case, the PCDS was incorporated into the agreement for sale and its provisions accordingly became part of the contract between Ms. Schira and the parties.
There are 15 questions under the category “Structural”.
There are only three ways in which a seller may answer these questions – “Yes”, “No” or “Does Not Apply”.
Finally, there is a space available to provide additional comments and/or explanations.
There, there are several clauses of general application, including the following:
BUYERS MUST STILL MAKE THEIR OWN ENQUIRIES
The buyers must still make their own enquiries after receiving the disclosure statement.
Each question and answer must be considered and, where necessary, keeping in mind that the sellers’ knowledge of the property may be incomplete, additional information can be requested from the sellers or from an independent source such as the Municipality.
to October 6, 2009 Judgment (2009 SKQB 394)
This amount, $6,995.41, is referred to at para. [152] of the judgment.
                                                                                                M-E. Wright J.  ","The plaintiff bought a house.
She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon.
The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski.
The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations.
She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects.
She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser.
She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her.
The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently.
The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors.
Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages.
The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses.
Two main issues are raised.
The first is the liability of each of the defendants.
The second issue is quantum of damages.
The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues.
HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract.
Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation.
Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage.
In that respect their liability is concurrent.
The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several.
As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.
 1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17.
It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events.
The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283.
2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt.
3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court.
They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action.
Their evidence was largely unchallenged.
The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters.
Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved.
No inspection was done after the house was moved.
4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS).
The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting.
The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house.
The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems.
It should have been disclosed.
Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage.
The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper.
The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5)
It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS.
A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007]
O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL).
The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage.
The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home.
With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply.
6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff.
The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168.
7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent.
8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999.
She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase.
Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion.
At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed.
Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case.
The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment.
Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different.
Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase.
9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation.
He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'.
This was incorrect.
Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS.
He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage.
He also knew the skylight leaked.
The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.
 10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613.
She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home.
There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract.
She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages.
Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed.
Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed.

[3]            The plaintiff’s affidavit describes the circumstances of the assault.
The defendant has chosen not to file any affidavit in response.
[7]            As a result of his assault on the plaintiff, the defendant was charged with assault causing bodily harm under the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1995, c. C-46.
He eventually pled guilty and on December 2, 2002, was sentenced by the Provincial Court to a fine of $1,500.00, placed on probation for a period of 18 months, and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of dental work in the amount of $3,263.30.

HELD: 1)
The defendant pled guilty to a charge of assault causing bodily harm.
He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30.

He is awarded general damages of $12,500.
3) The pleadings and the affidavit evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages.

Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers.

That Supplementary Interim Ruling is attached and reproduced again in its entirety as follows:
SUPPLEMENTARY INTERIM RULING
By written reasons provided on January 4, 2011, the Court refused to issue the small claims summons for reasons provided therein.
On March 10, 2011, an eight page letter responding to that decision was provided to the Court by the proposed Plaintiff’s solicitor.
Further direction is apparently required.
With respect to that issue, reference is made to paragraph 10 of the decision that I provided on January 4, 2011.
[38]           Further, insofar as the potential claims attempt to address contractual issues, there is no privity of contract between any of the claimants and the Government of Saskatchewan, let alone the other named Defendants.
[39]           Section 7(4) of The Small Claims Act contemplates a decision such as the present one.
It provides:  “Where a judge refused to issue a summons, that refusal does not prevent a plaintiff from proceeding in the Court of Queen’s Bench or in any other manner authorized by law.”
The claimants in this case are therefore free to pursue their action in that Court as they might wish.

S. D. Loewen, J","The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals.
The issue was whether the claims should be issued.
HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued.
In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function.
Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case.
The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief.
A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract.
Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement.
As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court.
Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","[160, 159, 244, 242, 243, 161, 158, 240, 163, 241, 117, 162, 239]"

She recalled no other discussion and did not remember telling the town to leave the water on or being told gas and water meters would have to be moved if the property was demolished.
Erin Sackmann
Ms. Sackmann is the utility clerk for the Town of Martensville, a post she has held since September, 2005.
She explained the process required to have water service terminated and disconnected which was to sign the back of the work order.
The nature of the call concerned possible demolition of the subject property.
Ms. Gorelitza informed Ms. Webster that if the property was to be demolished or moved, a permit would be required and the proper disconnects would have to be made.
She noted on her file that Ms. Webster advised that the property would either be moved or demolished in the spring.
IV        ANALYSIS
After carefully considering the testimony of the witnesses and the exhibits filed herein, the Court concludes that the plaintiff’s action cannot succeed for the following reasons:
a)         The Court cannot find on the evidence that clear instructions were given by the plaintiff to the town to disconnect the water service.
There is no order as to costs.

HELD: The claim is dismissed.
1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water.
2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained.
3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself.
She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property.
No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned.

JUNE 8, 2000
BASIS OF CLAIM:
The Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant is for crop damage sustained as a result of  the Defendant’s cattle getting into the Plaintiff’s canola field in late July, 1999.  
The Defendant admits that his cattle were in the Plaintiff’s canola crop on one occasion.
Less 2% Wild Animal Damage                             61.05
Less 5% reduction in Farm Expenses               152.62
Less 5% for Dockage                                         152.62
Net Damages Sustained by Plaintiffs            $2,533.45
Judgment in the amount of $2,533.45 is therefore granted in favour of the Plaintiffs, together with Pre-judgment interest from January 5, 2000 and costs.
Dated at the City of Melfort in the Province of Saskatchewan this 8th day of June,  2000.
THE HONOURABLE B.D. HALDERMAN","The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field.
The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD:
Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45.
The court valued the loss at $3,052.36.
It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production.
Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act.
A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle. 
This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence.
The issue here is the quantum of the damage.
The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case.
An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels.
The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","[3, 0, 7, 6, 134, 5, 8, 133, 11, 132, 131, 12, 10, 130, 9, 128, 129, 14, 13, 15, 16]"

Accordingly, there will be an order that the respondent pay child support of $300.00 per month per child during months when his gross monthly earnings are $2,200.00 or greater and $150.00 per month per child when his gross monthly earnings are less than $2,200.00.             Further the arrears are reduced by $7,000.00 and when the respondent earns $2,200.00 per month or more he shall pay $200.00 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation.             The order of Dickson J. of September 22, 1993 is continued and it is further ordered that the respondent file quarterly, a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing income received from employment with the maintenance enforcement office commencing September 30, 1996 and every three months thereafter until the arrears are paid in full.                                                                J. ","The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600.
The original corollary relief was made in 1989.
An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted.
The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed.
She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue.
HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less.
Arrears were reduced by $7,000.
When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation.
The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office.
1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances.
2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance.
It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations.

The actual amount is $210.00 which is 33 per cent of his present income of $630.00.
            In this regard, I simply say that there is no requirement that the respondent live in a group home and there is no basis upon which I can order or even expect such.
As to the matter of luxurious living, I do not see a monthly expenditure of $200.00 to amount to such.
The fact remains, the respondent is in the position of not being able to obtain suitable shelter on his own and that is deplorable.
            Ultimately I conclude that there is sufficient total means to enable the petitioner and the children to enjoy a reasonable standard of living and the respondent to enjoy an improved standard.
The latter can be achieved by providing to the respondent some of the income earned from his land.
Conclusion
            In the result, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent the annual sum of $6,000.00, which shall be paid in monthly installments of $500.00 commencing April 1, 1999.
The respondent will have his costs of this application in any event of the cause, which costs I fix at $400.00.","The respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support.
The parties were married in January 1991 with three children and ceased to cohabit in December of 1996.
The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed.
In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind.
He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month.
The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home.
The petitioner and children live in that home.
The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic.
The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income.
The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month.
HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500.
There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage.
In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue.
Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","[1, 0, 101, 99, 2, 98, 3, 4, 5, 97, 96, 6, 95, 7, 100, 8, 93, 94]"

I conclude by commenting briefly on the role and jurisdiction of this Court in appeals from the decisions of the Rentalsman.
The Act itself is clear that only errors of law or jurisdiction are appealable.
As well, the case law limits the court to a supervisory role.
Notably, there is nothing in these provisions either prohibiting or requiring the director to schedule multiple applications relating to the same dispute to the same hearing date.
          The appeal is allowed.
The decision of the hearing officer is set aside and the matter remitted back to the hearing officer for a re-hearing.

The hearing officer determined that the landlord's claim for non-payment of rent had been established and that an order for possession as warranted.
The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent.
The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem.
They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal.
HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs.
However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient.
The Court held that it was impossible to tell whether the hearing officer considered the tenants' evidence at the hearing, made findings of fact in that regard or whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in this situation.
The reasons are inadequate to allow a meaningful review of the decision.","[40, 0, 97, 41, 98, 39, 43, 1, 96, 42, 44, 2, 38, 45, 93]"

Jackson J.A. (in Chambers)
Ms. April Schoenthal and Mr. Ryan Dalrymple in person
I have decided the following questions warrant leave to appeal: 
Did the Chambers judge err in finding that the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make an order granting possession on the basis that “[t]he rent was 15 days or more in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice” if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession?
In answering the first question, did the Chambers judge err in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid?
The tenants have until 4:00 p.m. on August 31, 2006 to serve and file their notice of appeal and 15 days thereafter to file their appeal book and factum.
If the tenants serve and file their notice of appeal by 4:00 p.m. on August 31, 2006, but do not pay the August rent by the end of August 31, or do not pay their September rent, the landlord has leave to apply on 48 hours notice to lift any stay of execution.
There will be no order as to costs.

 1) The parties agree that the rent for July was paid on July 27.
The landlord then immediately applied for and was granted a writ of possession. 2)
The tenants advise that the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month rent of the tenancy.
The landlord claims it is a security deposit. 3)
The tenants claim they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arrears were accepted on that basis. 4)
The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's appeal the same day saying 'the rent for August has not been paid and not paid by required time, appeal is dismissed'.
5) The first issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in finding the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make the order granting possession on the basis that 'the rent was 15 days in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice' if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession.

In the documents filed, Mr. Flood asserts that his injuries were greater than those presented by the Crown, and the accused have minimized their involvement and culpability for the offence.

CONCLUSION
[43]           Taking into consideration both the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances, the principles of sentencing, the facts, and the circumstances of the accused I cannot conclude that incarceration in a facility is an appropriate disposition in the circumstances.
[44]           In my view a fine plus a probation order with strict conditions can accomplish the principles of sentencing as quoted above.
The principles of parity demand similar sentences in the circumstances.

Both parties were ordered to have no contact with the other and the husband was ordered to pay $2,000.00 lump sum support for the children at the end of the 1994 harvest.
It appears that the husband undertook to pay periodic child support if he got a job off the farm.
An earlier consent order forbade the husband from disposing of matrimonial property.             Since then, the wife says her husband has continued to dispose of farm machinery and the 1994 crops.
She says he has  been earning money trucking and leasing out farm machinery for custom work on neighbouring farms.
He denies it.
I don't know who to believe.
He also says the harvested crop has a negative value.
She doesn't know anything about the unpaid expenses.

The Husband claimed that the value of the crop harvested was less than the farm expenses and resisted any change in the previous interim orders made.

         I am not satisfied there is any ""extraordinary circumstance"" as provided in s. 22(1) of the Act which would prevent the value of the family home from being divided equally between the parties.
         I also conclude that the value of the Melville residence owned by the petitioner at the time of the marriage to be exempt from distribution in accordance with the parties' agreement at the time of the marriage.
It has not increased in value and the maintenance thereof was born solely by the petitioner during the years of the marriage.
Although it may be argued that the Melville home was at one time the ""family home"" of the parties, I designate the Regina condominium to be the family home of the parties pursuant to s. 22(3) of the Act as the parties resided therein for most of the marriage.
         The petitioner therefore is entitled to judgment for half of the value of the assets acquired after marriage being:
➢                                   One-half of the value of the condominium                                       $42,000.00
➢                                   One-half of the value of the furniture, vehicle and camper           $12,000.00

They married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in 1997.
Each had significant assets at the time of the marriage, which had increased in value.
They agreed at the time of the marriage to keep their assets separate and to not make a claim on the assets of the other and that their entire estates would be left to their respective children.
 The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths.
HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000.
1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention.
This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act.
The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death.
2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a).
There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home.

No. 3 of 2006 Judicial Centre: Saskatoon RE RELEVANCE OF WIRETAP TO CHARTER APPLICATION BETWEEN: HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN - and - WENDELL WILLICK Counsel: Sandeep S. Bains for the Crown Daryl E. Labach for Wendell Willick JUDGMENT POPESCUL J. September 12, 2007 INTRODUCTION [1]
This is an application by the accused, Wendell Willick, for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant.
The accused stands charged as follows: WENDELL WILLICK, of the City of SASKATOON, in the Province of Saskatchewan, stands charged that he, the said Wendell Willick did 1.
The indictment was amended on July 27, 2007, by consent, to read ""153(1)(a)"" rather than ""153(a)"".
As a result, I view the seriousness of the breach, if there was one, to be minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
Accordingly, I find that the evidence is relevant and admissible in that it does not violate the accused's s. 8 rights.
Even if it did, the evidence is non-conscriptive and ought not to be excluded under s. 24(2) because the breach was not serious and inadvertent and admitting the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
Therefore, the accused's applications are dismissed.                           J. M.D. POPESCUL","This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant.
Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2).
The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code.
HELD: The evidence is admissible.
The accused's application is dismissed.
1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant.
The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship.
The conversation is logically probative to the charge.
2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization.
The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations.
3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code.
That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained.
The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization.
The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered.
Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code.
During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code.
The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence.
Therefore, there is no Charter breach.
4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence.
Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.
The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion.
In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship.
There is no evidence of bad faith.
There is no evidence of manipulation.
The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","[131, 1, 129, 130, 127, 5, 3, 0]"

An order has been made in this case prohibiting publication of any information that could disclose the identity of the young person pursuant to s. 75(3) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act
The evidence supported the view that he could not be controlled in a non-custodial setting.
The Crown’s sentence appeal was allowed and, after granting four months credit for his time in pre-sentence custody, this Court imposed a sentence of 14 months closed custody to be followed by seven months community supervision.
There is no suggestion in the decision that deterrence was a factor taken into account.
The Crown’s application for leave to appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent is granted and the appeal is allowed.
The respondent has already served the 90 day closed custody portion of the sentence originally imposed.
That sentence is to be set aside.
In addition to the time already served, the respondent is to serve 12 months in closed custody to be followed by a period of community supervision of six months and a period of probation of one year.
He will also be subject to a 10 year firearms prohibition as in the original sentence.","This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act.
The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code.
The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition.
HELD: Appeal allowed orally.
The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.
 1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all.
It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted.
The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant.
Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor.
2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","[0, 100, 97, 98, 99, 1, 3, 2, 96, 4, 94, 5, 6, 92, 93]"

I accept and adopt the reasoning in these judgments.
As to the possible application of s. 9(6) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000,  it should be noted that subsection (7) of s. 9 says that where a provision of the section conflicts with the provision of an enactment governing an appeal, the provision of the enactment prevails.
Accordingly, s 14(2) of the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act prevails over s. 9(6) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000.
Both the application for extension of time and the application for leave to appeal are dismissed with costs in the usual way.","This was an application for an order extending the time to apply for leave to appeal and for leave to appeal.
Sections 13 and 14 of the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act govern the appeal.
The applicant took no steps to appeal within the 21 day period due to an inadvertence of its lawyer.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The plain and ordinary meaning of the words of s. 14(2) of the Act is that only the court appealed from has power to extend the time within which leave must be sought.

As a result, the Crown has to take refuge in the kind of language employed in this Information.
Perhaps more information could have been provided, however, there was information upon which the respondent, acting judicially, could be satisfied that a search warrant should issue.
Courts should not be too technical when scrutinizing the Information in support of a search warrant; substantial compliance with s. 443 is sufficient.
Informations are prepared by peace officers who are not trained as legal draftsmen, and they often have to prepare the Informations under time constraints, faced with a possibility that evidence will disappear if they do not act quickly to seize it.
A reasonable latitude must be granted when the wording of the Information is being considered: see Re Time Square Book Store and The Queen, supra, at p. 512 and Re Lubell and The Queen, supra, at p. 190.

[2]              This is an application brought by the Agency for a finding that the Respondent has abused a child as described in Section 62(a) or (b) or (c) of the Children and Family Services Act.
It is for the purpose of entry of the Respondent’s name in the Child Abuse Register.
THE LAW:
It does not adopt so high a degree as a criminal court even when it is considering a charge of criminal nature but still it does require a degree of probability which is commensurate with the occasion.
The Complainant gave specific detailed evidence of sexual relations with the Respondent all of which is denied by him.
On a “balance of probabilities” the Court finds that the evidence of the Complainant that she was sexually assaulted by the Respondent has more probability of truth than disbelief.

On the information provided to the Court from both parties it is conceivable with the material before me, the plaintiff’s injuries could be described as minor.
Thus, a Court should be extremely cautious in approaching an award in this particular category in absence of significant medical evidence which would clearly establish this injury classification could be overcome.
It must be recalled that under the legislation the onus is on the plaintiff to prove that any injuries she sustained are not minor injuries.
On a review of the material supplied for this application, I am not satisfied that this is an appropriate case to order an interim payment at this point in time and I decline to do so.
In my opinion, to assess any amount of interim payment on facts presented would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess.
However, as I said before, I would order summary judgment be entered against the defendant with damages to be assessed.
Each party having been partially successful, I would order no costs to either side.
Order accordingly.","The plaintiff, who was injured in a rear-end motor vehicle accident, applied for summary judgment and an interim payment of damages.
Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed.
There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle.
The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess.
The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","[0, 1, 111, 113, 112, 108, 110, 2, 5, 107, 3, 109, 7, 4, 104]"

Mr. Martin Boudreault -   No My Lord,  I’ve nothing else to add.
The Court - Nothing.
The Court - Well, I don’t know.
I have nothing before me as to who did what, who agreed to what, and who disagreed with what prior to hearing of the application.
In the absence of evidence of that kind, I don’t want to base a decision on what it might have been.
I think the applicants had every right to bring this application, probably had a duty to do so because of the rather unusual circumstances of the occurrence of the accident in a different jurisdiction.
I am going to grant the applicant some costs even though it has been unsuccessful on the question of forum non conveniens because, in a different sense, the applicants have not been successful in getting what they want.
I am going to keep those costs relatively low.
I am going to suggest an amount like $400.00. ","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident in Quebec and commenced an action in Nova Scotia.
The applicant applied to determine whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia concerning the Quebec accident and to dismiss the action on the basis that Nova Scotia was a forum non conveniens.
Application to dismiss the action dismissed; the forum conveniens is Nova Scotia.
The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens.
In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens.
The substantive law governing the proceeding will be the law of the place where the accident occurred and the governing procedural law will be the law of the place of the trial.","[0, 65, 64, 63, 2, 62, 61, 3, 60, 1, 5, 4, 59, 7, 57, 8, 6, 56, 9]"

Gavin Giles, Q.C., for the respondent 2301072 Nova Scotia Ltd.
Dufferin R. Harper and Barbara Kerr, Articled Clerk, for the Intervenor
Reasons for judgment:
[1]              The appellants apply for leave to amend their notice of appeal.
Leave is required because the notice was filed more than 20 days ago: Rule 62.04(4).
The application is opposed by the respondent 2301072 Nova Scotia Limited and the intervenor.
As, in my view, their arguments in opposition to the amendment relate to the merits of the point raised by it, those arguments are for a panel and not a chambers judge to consider.
The permitted amendment is to add to the notice of appeal the following ground of appeal: 
THAT the learned Chambers Judge erred in law when he ruled contrary to the law prohibiting champerty and maintenance           that 2301072 Nova Scotia Limited is a lawful plaintiff in proceeding S.H. No. 102390.
The amended notice of appeal shall be included in the appeal book and leave to amend is granted on the condition that the appeal book be filed, as previously ordered, on or before January 15, 2007.
As agreed in chambers, costs of this application will be costs in the cause of the appeal.","The appellants applied for leave to amend their notice of appeal in regard to an order requiring them to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications.
The application was opposed, inter alia, on the basis that the allegations which underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the trial judge, were irrelevant on the application and were not ruled on by the trial judge.
Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed;
the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent.
The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal.
It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make.
The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","[52, 0, 18, 51, 17, 16, 50, 49, 19, 20, 15, 1, 21]"

The Mother shall have sole custody, care and control of the child.
The Father shall have supervised access for the maximum time available through Veith House twice a week.
If the parties cannot agree upon the date and time I retain jurisdiction to do so. 
-        If the report from Veith House reflects significant concerns supervised access is to continue until a positive report is received after which the provisions for unsupervised access shall apply.
The reports are to be prepared by Veith House personal and provided to the parties in six week intervals.
If the parties disagree about the significance of any concern reported by Veith House personal I retain jurisdiction to adjudicate upon this matter.
The Father is not to be under the influence of any non-prescription drug 12 hours before and while he has the child in his care.
The Father is to attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he will be informed about child development and understand how to appropriately parent the child.
Beryl MacDonald, J.S.C.","The parties' hostility prevented them from reaching an agreement on interim parenting arrangements for their two-and-a-half-year-old child.
There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months).
The mother had nothing positive to say about him.
They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child.
He agreed to abstain from drugs around the child and for 12 hours before access.
The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country.
Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access.
The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs.
There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy.
There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk.
Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so.
While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.","[1, 220, 2, 217, 3, 218, 219, 4, 6, 8, 7, 215, 214, 210, 5, 10, 216, 211]"

Susanne M. Litke & Sharon Avery, Student at Law, for the Respondent
Reasons for judgment:
[1]              This is an appeal from an order made pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act, S.N.S. 1989, c. 160 as amended, requiring the appellant father, Gilbert Roland Hill to pay maintenance for his son James Anthony Davis.
The respondent, Pamela Davis, is James’ mother.
BACKGROUND
[2]              Roland Hill and Pamela Davis, had a brief relationship in 1981 when Ms. Davis was 16 years old.
Their child, James Davis, was born on June 2nd, 1982.
[3]              Ms. Davis says she told Mr. Hill of James birth early on.
[34]         Mr. Hill further says the judge should have time-limited the payment of support - tying it to a specific time within which James should complete his education.
I have concluded the order for support was not premised on James’ continuing dependency as a result of his pursuit of post-secondary studies.
James’  future ability to “withdraw from parental charge” is unknown.
It is not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.
In summary,  I am not persuaded there was any evidentiary basis upon which the judge could conclude that the Guideline amount was “inappropriate” and therefore depart from it.
He did not err.
DISPOSITION
Concurred in:","The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday.
He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity.
The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father.
The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program.
The father appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident.
There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","[0, 15, 168, 166, 1, 13, 2, 14, 165, 3, 16, 163, 12, 164, 162, 19, 17, 161, 18, 160]"

The first involves issues of custody, access, child and spousal support.
The second relates to classification, valuation and division of several pieces of property.
I will deal with the less contentious Divorce Act issues first.
[6]              Divorce:   A Divorce Order was issued on June 14, 2004 on the basis of a one (1) year separation.
I was satisfied that all statutory requirements were met and there was no possibility of reconciliation.
I do so because she is the primary care parent and because this couple cannot effectively communicate on these kinds of issues.
This will allow sufficient time to take legal action if either parent feel such action is warranted.
[84]         Debts - Obligations:    The parties have argued there are outstanding financial obligations that should be included in the overall property division.
Consequently I conclude they were resolved prior to the parties separation and no order will be made respecting these amounts.
    Conclusion:   It will be apparent to the parties that I have decided to treat their property as matrimonial and, therefore, equally divisible.
The following table sets forth the property division.
EQUALIZATION TABLE
Asset
Mr. Faddoul pays Ms. Faddoul to equalize division of property","The parties were married for 13 years and had three children.
Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents.
The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college.
In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties.
Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided.
The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property.
This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture.
A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed.
This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","[399, 37, 0, 398, 400, 1, 36, 386, 369, 413, 53, 2, 385, 39, 35, 91, 38]"

By the Court:
[1]              On August 9, 2006, Robert Terry Goreham was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along Highway #3 in the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia.
At the time his driver’s license was revoked.
These facts were agreed and the only issue at this trial is whether this makes the accused guilty of the offence of driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his license was revoked contrary to s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act.
In this case Mr. Goreham could not have obtained a license to drive an ATV on the highway because it was a prohibited vehicle.
It was a vehicle of  the wrong type or class to get a license.
Mr. Goreham is, therefore, not guilty of driving a motor vehicle while his license was revoked and the charge under s. 287(2) is dismissed.
I hasten to add that this does not mean Mr. Goreham’s conduct was lawful.
In fact, he would certainly have been guilty of  driving a prohibited vehicle on the highway under s. 11, but that is not the charge before the court.","The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked when he was found operating an all terrain vehicle (ATV) on a highway.
Accused found not guilty;
the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle.
Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","[64, 0, 10, 11, 62, 63, 12, 14, 13, 61, 60]"
1020,"(a)     the lots are substantially the same as shown on the tentative plan;
Having reviewed these plans, I agree with Applicant and find that the lots are substantially the same as shown on the tentative plan.
(b)     any conditions on the approval of the tentative plan have been met;
This speaks to the future and therefore can only apply to requisite services at the time the tentative plan was approved.
(d)     the complete application for final subdivision plan approval is received within two years of the date of the approval of the tentative plan.
This decision is therefore set aside.
On the same basis, the Applicant is entitled to a declaration that the application for final subdivision is complete, (again subject to non-contentious error in the plan).
THE MANDAMUS APPLICATION  
The requirements for mandamus are exacting.
Justice Rogers in Rawdon Realties Limited et al v. Rent Review Commission (1982), 56 N.S.R. (2d) 403 (S.C.T.D.), considered the prerequisites.
At page 405 he stated:
Therefore,  an order for mandamus is appropriate and I so order.
Specifically, I direct the development officer to issue the final approval (subject only to the Applicant correcting the technical error in the plan).
Michael MacDonald 
Associate Chief Justice","The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval.
In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications.
The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus.
Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan).
The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness.
The development officer misinterpreted the legislation.
Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval.
There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate.
The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete.
Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","[91, 139, 72, 90, 92, 137, 138, 64, 71, 136, 62, 94, 93, 63, 89]"
1021,"IN THE PROVINCIAL COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA
Mark Sutherland
Section 74(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act provides that the penalty for a corporation violating the regulations under the Act is a maximum fine of $250,000.
Section 75 establishes a range of additional sentencing options, sometimes referred to as ""creative sentencing options"" that can include:  directing the offender to pay to the Minister an amount for the purpose of public education in the safe conduct of the activity in relation to which the offence was committed, and principles of internal responsibility provided for in the Act; community service; and requiring the offender to comply with such other reasonable conditions as the court considers appropriate and just.
The Crown and Defence have taken a joint position that the total amount of the fine in this case should be $25,000.
I will finally note that while I certainly appreciate that farmers do not work 40 hour weeks, that if one takes a conventional 40 hour week, obviously 160 hours is four such weeks and that is how I arrived at the 160 hour figure.
That is a substantial contribution directly by Mr. Sutherland to farm safety in light of his other responsibilities with respect to his dairy business.       ","The defendant farmer pled guilty to failing to take every precaution that was reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons in the workplace, after a young employee drowned in a manure pit that was not properly secured due to a damaged barricade having been removed while a new one was on order.
Defendant sentenced to fine of $25,000, from which the sum of $15,000 shall be paid to the Canadian Farmers' Disability Registry; defendant ordered to perform 160 hours of community service with respect to farm safety.
The defendant was an individual and not a huge corporation, had been conscientious about safety issues prior to this incident and had endeavored to improve safety at his farm after the incident; the deceased had also failed in his responsibilities under the Act and was working with a significant blood alcohol content.","[5, 0, 77, 42, 44, 76, 43]"

THE COURT:      Appeal allowed per reasons for judgment of Cromwell, J.A.; Bateman and Flinn, JJ.A. concurring.
Disputes arising from collective agreements must be resolved through the grievance and arbitration process.
The main issue here is whether this principle applies to bar the union's lawsuit in this case.
The question of whether this dispute is one that concerns the interpretation, application or administration of the collective agreement should be left, initially at least, to an arbitrator.
There are four considerations that support this conclusion, and I will briefly describe each of them.
(c)         The nature of the inquiry
Under Weber and O'Leary, the question of whether the subject-matter of the dispute falls within the collective agreement is to be approached by determining the dispute's ""essential character"": see Weber at p. 956.
This determination of the ""essential character"" of the dispute requires a detailed analysis of the facts and the provisions of the particular collective agreement.
The respondent should pay costs to the appellant in the amount of $750.

REASONS FOR JUDGEMENT BY: ","The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996.
The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year.
Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries.
In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze.
After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act.
The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation.
The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator.
The Chambers judge dismissed the application.
The employer appealed.
Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue.
Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration.
This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","[243, 232, 230, 231, 233, 242, 222, 16, 3, 228, 80, 126, 241, 234, 17, 18, 79, 128, 221, 220, 19, 4, 127]"

HEARD:        at Halifax, Nova Scotia before the Honourable Justice Margaret J. Stewart on December 13, 1994
DECISION:   February 10, 1995
The Applicant, Cape Breton District School Board (the ""Cape Breton Board""), operates fifty‑five schools, providing public school education from Primary to Grade 12 for approximately eighteen thousand students.
However, this is a matter for the Minister and absent a request by the Cape Breton Board and approval by the Governor in Council, not a matter of obligation under the Education Act.
In respect to the declaration sought by the Cape Breton Board, the Province is responsible to provide adequate school buildings for the delivery of a basic Public School Program to the students of the Province.
Where the Minister has received a request in the proper form and determined, with the approval of the Governor in Council, that it is necessary to lease a school building in order to meet the Province's statutory obligation then the cost of such a lease is the responsibility of the Province.
The lease costs are to the same extent as would be the cost of supplying the building free of costs.
It would not, of course, include those expenses associated with operating the building and which are funded by the property services component of the general funding formula for public school education.
There shall be no costs.","The applicant sought a declaration that the province was responsible for providing school buildings for delivery of the public school program and that when buildings must be leased, the province bore the associated costs.
The applicant, which leased six school buildings from the Roman Catholic Church, submitted the respondent was required to reimburse the applicant for leasing costs.
For the respondent,
that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval.
Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs.
Where the Minister received a request in the proper form and where it was determined leases were necessary, the leasing costs would be the respondent's responsibility.","[74, 73, 6, 7, 70, 72, 8, 71, 10, 69]"

RELEASE
OF ORAL:     April 28, 1995
Jonathan C.K. Stobie, Esq., for the Plaintiff 
D. Kevin Latimer, Esq., for the Defendant
Were time available, my preference would have been to give written reasons which would have been more elaborate than these.
In that way, should the unsuccessful party wish to appeal my decision or should a transcript of these proceedings be required for any ancillary matters in Ontario, that could be arranged in short order.
I glean the following summary of the facts from the pleadings.
""She...""(referring to Justice Bateman)""found that the respondent did not appreciate the consequences of not defending; the respondent's testimony supports this finding.
She also found that he understood an adequate response could be made in Ontario; the respondent's testimony supports this finding.""
In the result, I see no evidentiary basis sufficient to persuade me that in order to do justice between these parties, I should exercise my discretion in favour of the defendant.
For all of these reasons then, the defendant's application is dismissed with costs to the plaintiff in the amount of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00).
It is, therefore, unnecessary for me to consider the plaintiff's subsidiary request for directions, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 25, nor the issue of appropriate forum.","The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued.
Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs.
The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence.
Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff,
that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant.
Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","[196, 15, 195, 0, 16, 14, 1, 192, 13, 19, 17, 188, 20, 190]"

The reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered orally by:
This is an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that on March 11, 1995, he broke and entered a used car dealership office in Antigonish and committed the offense of theft of a 1994 Chev Blazer contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.
A passing motorist familiar with the Blazer saw it being driven from the lot at 12:15 o'clock in the morning.
He informed the police who, upon finding the office had been broken into and the Blazer keys were missing, took chase.
They came upon the Blazer on the highway.
When it was stopped two persons exited the Blazer and ran away.
Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY: Clarke, C.J.N.S. (Orally)","This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.
The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning.
The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals.
Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook.
Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing.
The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow.
The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession.
He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle.
Dismissing the appeal,
that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge.
The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).","[57, 62, 56, 50, 10, 2, 58, 61, 12, 11, 55, 3, 51, 9, 47, 13, 46, 14, 45, 15, 44, 16, 17]"

THE COURT:                 Application for the stated case dismissed, per oral reasons for judgment of Flinn, J.A.; Chipman and Roscoe, JJ.A. concurring.
The reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered orally by:
We are substantially in agreement with the submissions of counsel for the respondent that this Court should decline to answer the questions submitted to it by the applicant.
These questions are eight in number, but when broken down into their several parts, result in some forty questions.
We are asked to relate those forty questions, not to one case, but to nineteen factual summaries presented by the Board with respect to cases before it.
In Hebb v. Family and Children's Services of Lunenburg County et al (1982), 51 N.S.R. (2d) 447, Macdonald J.A. said the following at p. 449-450:
Likewise, the development of law under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is best served by deciding cases before the courts, not by anticipating the results of future cases.
We, therefore, decline to answer the questions which the Board has submitted.

1029,"[1]        Kathryn Bureau appeals from an Order of Justice K. Peter Richard of the Supreme Court fixing damages in an action for wrongful dismissal.
The trial decision is reported at (1998), 1998 CanLII 3563 (NS SC), 171 N.S.R. (2d) 360.
In his provisional comments on damages for negligent misrepresentation Justice Richard said (at p.370):
These two factors alone would bear very heavily on any calculation of Bureau's damages.
The respondent argues that in fixing damages for the unjust dismissal Justice Richard should have made allowance for this failure to mitigate.
On the damages for wrongful dismissal he said (at p.372):
The final termination notice and dismissal came very swiftly and in a somewhat peremptory fashion.  Although the notice provided for two months' salary, only one month was actually paid.  Considering all the factors enumerated in Bardal v. Globe & Mail Ltd. quoted in Wallace, supra and also that Bureau's only recourse was to rebuild her consulting practice I fix the period of notice at five months.  One month was paid on termination leaving a balance of four months outstanding.
Justice Richard’s earlier remarks on damages reveal that he was alive to the question of mitigation.
There shall be no costs on the cross-appeal.

Her job was to start quality assurance practice.
She accepted an offer of employment, giving up her own company to do so.

The appellant appealed the dismissal of her claim for negligent misrepresentation and the notice period for her wrongful dismissal.

OF ORAL:                             March 23rd, 2000
SUBJECT:                           SPOUSAL ENTITLEMENT - TERMS
SUMMARY:                          Mr. Clarke, now 44, and Mrs. Clarke, now 41, married and cohabited for approximately 14 ½ years.
Numerous additional provisions requiring life insurance, medical/dental coverage, etcetera.
Limited spousal entitlement to terminate on completion of retraining allowance or transfer of balance of outstanding to Mrs. Clarke on 1st of September, 2001, whichever occurs first.
THIS INFORMATION SHEET DOES NOT FORM PART OF THE COURT’S DECISION.
QUOTES MUST BE FROM THE DECISION, NOT THIS COVER SHEET.","The parties were married for 14 years and separated in 1995, entering into a detailed Separation Agreement in 1998.
The two children of the marriage are 16 and 8 years of age.
There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment.
The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training.
For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00
The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since.
The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00.
The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment.
This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties.
The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose.
Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001.
An adjustment was also made to account for arrears in child support and child support payments.","[321, 296, 297, 295, 320, 291, 292, 3, 293, 2, 289, 290, 298, 319, 288, 8, 282, 245, 12, 318, 6, 299, 246, 9, 215, 281]"

DECISION:                 March 29, 2001
The parties have not addressed the question of costs directly, pending my decision.
Having said that, it would appear that success has been divided and that accordingly each party should prima facie bear their own costs.
I will leave it to the parties to decide if they want to make representations on this issue.
There will obviously be need for future adjustments as circumstances evolve with growing children, etc.
I would encourage the parties to explore some form of mediation if they have difficulty reaching agreement in the future.
SUMMARY
There will therefore be an order setting child support at $567.00 per month with Mr. Vermeulen contributing one half of Ben’s annual hockey registration and one half of Andrea’s one time driving course.
Mr. Vermeulen shall pay $8,000.00 lump sum spousal support to Ms. MacDonald, as indicated earlier.
Monthly spousal support shall terminate April 1, 2001, subject to the conditions mentioned earlier.
I will issue an order accordingly, consented as to form by both parties, and consented as to costs if agreed upon.","The parties were divorced two years ago and the matter had been finalized by an appeal decision in June, 1999.
Both parties made application to vary child support on the basis of changes (ups and downs) in the farming business.
The respondent wife, who recently purchased a house, also applied for lump sum spousal support which claim had been disallowed by the Court of Appeal.
Monthly spousal support terminated as wife now self-sufficient; child support increased due to increase in husband's income; lump sum payment of $8,000 awarded to wife to help pay her relocation expenses from move with husband given six months to pay lump sum, but monthly spousal support to continue until the $8,000 was paid in full.
Applications to vary should not be entertained simply because of the usual ups and downs of the farming business; the court must strive to average out the individual's ability to pay in such circumstances in order to ensure stability of payments for both parties.
Lump sum spousal support payments must not have the effect of a significant redistribution of the division of matrimonial property but the reasons for the belated application must be examined.","[0, 171, 172, 1, 2, 4, 168, 170, 3, 5, 166, 6, 7, 167, 164, 163, 8, 10, 161, 169]"

Mr. Mayrand and Mr. Walker from the OSB have also given evidence that they did not influence the R.C.M.P., and I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr. Redling is likely to have any additional information concerning that issue.
      I am not convinced that Mr. Redling is likely to have any relevant or material evidence  to provide with respect to the Charter Motions; I have reached  that conclusion based on the information and submissions concerning his involvement in the investigations which have been provided during this application, and also based on all the evidence given during the Charter Motions’ hearings.
The Application is accordingly dismissed.","The accused, charged with fraud, brought a motion to stay the proceedings on the basis that his Charter rights had been violated by the RCMP and the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy.

Roper Ltd. claims the following damages:
(ii)   Forced Liquidation of Capital Assets
In the circumstance, I am satisfied there was no loss from any forced liquidation arising from the termination of the contract.
(iii)      Specific Cost Recoveries
In any event, there is nothing in the circumstances of this case that would entitle Roper, even had he been a  plaintiff, to claim this amount and no authority was cited in support of such a claim.
As suggested by counsel for Devco, “Roper cannot re-characterize prejudgment interest simply by calling it “lost opportunity costs”“.

(vi)      Loss of Profit
There was no loss of profit, nor any loss of the opportunity to earn a profit.

In the circumstances, a fair and reasonable compensation for such additional effort, costs and expenses would be the sum of $10,000.00 which is hereby allowed to Roper Ltd..

TOTAL DEVCO DAMAGES
Loss of Opportunity for Profit on Future Contract","The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant.
In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor.
The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals.
The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid.
Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000.
Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents.
The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages.
Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained.
In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","[1041, 1054, 1014, 0, 1, 1015, 5, 1040, 899, 900, 10, 977, 6, 971, 999, 2, 1000, 14, 940, 1016, 972, 67, 941, 921, 11, 956]"

Christopher Manning, for the respondent
Reasons for judgment:
OVERVIEW
Therefore, I would allow the appeal and order a new trial.
ANALYSIS
I will begin my analysis by exploring the standard upon which we should review the judge's decision.
I will then analyze the judge's role when reviewing the JP's decision to issue the warrant.
Finally I will assess whether, in this case, the trial judge properly executed his role.
Standard of Review
A trial judge’s interpretation or application of a legal standard involves a question of law.
This corroborates the tipster's report.
‑       The covered basement windows further corroborated the alleged illegal activity.
Thus, on the evidence presented, I conclude that the search warrant was quashed in error.
The warrant having been valid, the search was lawful and there was no allegation that it was otherwise unreasonable.
Accordingly, on the evidence, there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and no basis on which to exclude the fruits of the search.
Had that evidence not been excluded, the result of the trial would not necessarily have been the same.
It follows that the appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.
DISPOSITION                                                                        
Concurred in:","The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence.
Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence.
The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test.
The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion.
Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration.
The Crown appealed.
Appeal allowed; new trial ordered.
Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it.
By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","[13, 0, 225, 223, 1, 12, 221, 77, 222, 220, 78, 30, 219, 76, 218, 79, 82, 216, 80, 14, 217]"

All three of these cases were heard in March of 1989 and a decision could come at any time.
In determining an appropriate remedy, all the usual factors taken into account by a court in constructing a remedy, should be taken into account by the Human Rights Commission.
Considering each claim and constructing appropriate remedies are well within the capabilities of the Human Rights Commission and its current remedial procedures seem best suited to the manner of handling complaints regarding alleged violations of human rights legislation.
That is a further supportive reason for my earlier indication that the proper forum for human rights complaints is the Human Rights Commission.
In conclusion, this Application is denied.
Therefore, each party shall bear its own costs.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA TRIAL DIVISION

TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF NOVA SCOTIA
Respondant","This was an application under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the two appellant university professors was invalid and denied the rights of the appellants as guaranteed under ss. 15(1) and (7) of the Charter, and an order for reinstatement and back pay.
Dismissing the application,
that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission.
The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint.
The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","[1, 2, 268, 269, 4, 3, 267, 19, 264, 18, 259, 263, 21, 262, 261, 258, 25, 23, 255, 257]"

DECISION
Stephen Kingston, Esq., for the defendant
Overview of Facts
Mr. Brookes was retained to incorporate a company, ""Z & P Developments Limited"" (Z & P) and to act as general legal counsel to Z & P and to the project.
One of Mr. Brookes' duties as legal counsel to the project was to obtain and disburse funds from mortgage draws or advances from various sources.
While performing those duties during late 1936 and early 1987, Mr. Brookes received a number of irrevocable letters of direction, which he acknowledged, requiring him to pay the proceeds from mortgage draws or advances in a particular manner.
Plaintiffs' Claims
The plaintiffs have also claimed Mr. Brookes was negligent in his written acknowledgement of this latter irrevocable letter of direction and that he broke the undertaking contained in that acknowledgement.
The plaintiffs have alleged negligent misrepresentation and in the alternative, breach of undertaking or breach of trust on the part of Mr. Brookes.
Apparently, the creditors committee was taking matters into their own hands.
Decision
On the basis of the findings and conclusion reached, I therefore dismiss all the claims of the plaintiffs against the defendant, with costs.
An order will issue accordingly.

DECISION OF BOUDREAU,","The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds.
The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking.
The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project.
When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers.
At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction.
The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction.
Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors.
The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'.
One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction.
On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters.
With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee.
Dismissing the action,
that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable.
Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it.
Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it.
The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project.
At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project; 
(2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;
 and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings.
The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members.
The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","[341, 342, 1, 0, 338, 339, 5, 6, 16, 24, 334, 9, 332, 330, 30, 333, 331, 26, 27, 33, 325, 32, 3, 28]"

OF ORAL DECISION:
COUNSEL:                                       Daniel Graham, Esq., and Cathy Benton, for the           Applicant
Donald Presse, Esq., for the Respondent
First of all, I would like to thank counsel for the assistance they have rendered to the court by way of briefs and submissions and the case law that has been provided to me.
The sequence of events leading up to the adjournment provided an adequate basis upon which the judge could exercise his discretion in favour of granting the adjournment.
There was sufficient material before the court upon which the court could satisfy itself that the second test as set out in Darville was met.
Again I note that the applicant concedes that the second test of neglect or laches is the main basis of his application.
One final matter that I would note is the suggestion that the decision had to be based on affidavit evidence, and I do not accept that premise as put forth by the applicant.
There have been numerous cases before the court wherein the court has made a discretionary decision based on submissions of counsel.
Both counsel made submissions and there was no controversy as to the events leading up to the witness not being available at the date of the trial.
I would dismiss the application.","The applicant sought an order for certiorari quashing a decision of the trial judge granting an adjournment and a prohibition from hearing the trial.
In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial.
The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify.
Due to the delay in obtaining authority to serve an out of town subpoena in New Brunswick, the Crown was unable to serve the victim until three days before trial.
The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend.
An adjournment was granted.
The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction.
Dismissing the application.
It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code.
Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law.
Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion.
If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ.
In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment.
There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.","[83, 12, 82, 81, 13, 11, 80, 14, 15, 79, 78, 77]"

January 23, 2014
This decision provides the court’s reasons for decision on both applications.
If it chooses to do so, the CÉF may apply for summary judgment in respect of this claim pursuant to Rule 7-2 of The Queen’s Bench Rules.
       II.  THE APPLICATION FOR AN INTERLOCUTORY INJUNCTION
          The plaintiffs applied for an interlocutory injunction that, had it been granted, would have required the CÉF to permit the plaintiffs to attend École de Bellegarde until further order of this Court.
Before explaining my specific reasons for dismissing that application, I will summarize the submissions of the parties and review the law as it relates to the granting of interlocutory injunctive relief.
The more complex or extended the performance, the more likely further proceedings will be needed to ascertain whether the defendant has complied with his or her obligations.
This fear of extended and complex litigation and the need for repeated requests for judicial intervention may be seen as a legitimate concern.
The cost to society of providing the resources necessary to implement specific performance decrees is properly considered by the court when weighing the advantages the specific relief might otherwise offer.
          For all of these reasons, the plaintiffs application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed.
                                                            CONCLUSION
                                                                                                                                  D. P. BALL","Civil Procedure Injunction
HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal.
While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted.
Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code.
With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog.
That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit.
The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable.
Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed.
The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","[14, 0, 502, 512, 501, 411, 500, 28, 499, 13, 412, 413, 410, 498]"

The testator died in January 2015 and application for probate had not yet been made.

ANALYSIS
          (1)       Did the trial judge err in failing to give effect to implied consent and in adopting a zero tolerance approach?
Did the learned trial judge err in failing to apply the de minimis non curat lex principle and acquit the accused of the assault charge?
                            The appellant submits the trial judge erred in three respects.
First, the trial judge failed to recognize the existence of implied consent in spousal relationships to a limited form of touching.
                            The appellant did not explain how the sentence imposed by the learned trial judge was demonstrably unfit, nor has he pointed to any error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor or erroneous consideration of an aggravating factor.
In short, the appellant asks this Court to impose a different sentence from the one imposed by the trial judge.
                            Absent an error of the type described, an appellate court may not intervene simply because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently than the trial judge.
                            Since no error has been identified, or for that matter is apparent from the record, there is no basis to intervene with the sentence imposed.
The appeal from sentence is therefore dismissed.
          L.M. SCHWANN","HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed.
The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it.
Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account.
The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial.
There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach.
The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling.
On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse.
She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver.
The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider.
It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","[96, 98, 255, 12, 97, 254, 253, 95, 99, 252, 256, 0, 251]"

The property which comprises the subject matter of the forfeiture action only becomes “proceeds of unlawful activity” because of the unlawful activity.
Furthermore, it provides that a person does not have to be charged with a criminal offence for the Director to pursue civil remedies under this statute.
The date of charges is irrelevant as is the need for a finding of criminal culpability.
                For the reasons given, there is no retroactivity problem.
2.           On a balance of probabilities, is the property proceeds of unlawful activity?
                Section 7 of the 2009 Act sets out the test the court must apply in determining whether to order forfeiture of seized property.
In order to make a forfeiture order in an application for forfeiture of property that is alleged to be proceeds of unlawful activity, the court: 
(a) is not required to be satisfied that the property was acquired in connection with a specific unlawful act; and 
                The seized property is proceeds of unlawful activity.
The forfeiture order proposed by the Director shall issue.
L.M. SCHWANN","HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure.
The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure.
The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability.
The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application.
The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective.
Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity.
The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act.
An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016.
The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period.
The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;
 2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply.
The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade.
The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000.
The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice.
The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","[223, 224, 221, 222, 1, 4, 2, 295, 294, 226, 0, 217, 293, 3, 5, 227, 220]"

Respondent (Plaintiff)
Jackson and Herauf JJ.A. and Wilkinson J. (ad hoc)
Appeal allowed
Written reasons by:
The Honourable Mr. Justice Herauf
The respondent is entitled to take out a deficiency judgment in the amount of $31,160.23 as at March 23, 2016, against the appellants.
[37]           During oral submissions, the respondent consented to the order for solicitor-client costs being set aside.
In its place, the parties agreed there should be an order that either party may return the matter of costs relating to the motion for the deficiency judgment to the Chambers judge.
The appeal will also be allowed to this extent.
[38]           The appellants have been successful on this appeal.
While the Court appreciates the concessions made by the respondent, these were only made at the hearing of the appeal after counsel for the appellants had made his submissions.
In our view, this is an appropriate case in which to order costs of the appeal to the appellant, John Alphonse Walker.

I concur.

In Andrew (CA) at para 14, this Court stated that s. 25 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act is “virtually identical” to s. 2 of the LCRA.","Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800.
The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land.
The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent.
The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186.
The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent.
As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency.
The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99.
The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA.
It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal.
Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","[1, 197, 0, 3, 198, 6, 196, 194, 7, 195, 190, 4, 188, 2, 192, 189, 193, 8, 5, 10, 185, 187, 184, 9, 186]"

                            The grandmother testified she looked after the children a lot while the mother was living with her from 2008 to 2011.
Further, even after the mother moved out to live with Josh, the maternal grandmother indicated that she stayed very involved.
In February 2014 the children, Arty and Haydn, moved into the grandmother’s home as the mother needed to be hospitalized.
The mother was in hospital for almost a year before she passed away January 19, 2015. 
                            The maternal grandmother was looking after the children full time, and she brought them to the hospital to see their mother every day.
She ensured the children attended school and did everything she could to support the children as their mother was dying.
                            I have no difficulty determining that the maternal grandmother is a person of sufficient interest regarding Arty and Haydn.
Not only does the grandmother have a “blood tie” to the children, but the children have lived with the grandmother for a significant portion of their lives.
The grandmother has standing under The Children’s Law Act to bring her application for custody.
CHILD SUPPORT
          D.L. WILSON","HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent.
They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends.
The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","[124, 563, 123, 1, 2, 0, 121, 122, 575, 120, 3, 119, 4, 5, 117, 118, 6, 116]"

This matter was adjourned until today’s date for formal sentencing.
Analysis
The guiding factors as contained within a s. 743.6 order have already been dealt with through the initial sentencing analysis.
As stated by Justice Wilkinson in R v Smith, 2008 SKCA 20 (CanLII) at para 73, 307 Sask R 45:
73  Section 743.6 has, on occasion, been scorned as the indiscriminate infliction of harsh punishment, the judicial application of salt to open wounds.
It can, nonetheless, serve as a companion piece in the sentencing process and as counterpoint, if necessary, when societal interests outweigh those of the individual, and rehabilitation, as a sentencing objective, has been given a legislative back seat.
       7.      Conclusion
                            For all the reasons as outlined in this decision I have concluded that as to the manslaughter conviction a sentence of 10 years in a federal institution is an appropriate sentence in the circumstances of this specific case.
(e)   The victim surcharge to be imposed pursuant to s. 737 of the Criminal Code in the amount of $400.00 shall be payable forthwith and in default of payment four days to be served consecutive to the sentence imposed today.
                                                M.L. DOVELL","HELD: The court sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 10 years for the manslaughter conviction.
A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm.
The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary.
The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor.
The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","[10, 221, 0, 235, 22, 222, 219, 234, 218, 127, 220, 217]"
