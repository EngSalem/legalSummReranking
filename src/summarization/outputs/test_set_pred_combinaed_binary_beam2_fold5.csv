He used his position of authority as police chief to commit the crimes. The offender did not have a criminal record. The offences were premeditated, and directed against trusting and well-intentioned organizations. Sentencing the offender to four months consecutive imprisonment on each count, for a total of twenty months, and ordering restitution to the victims,  that the sentence must serve as a message of deterrence to all individuals who hold positions of trust and authority. This message is particularly important to police officers, whose integrity must be beyond reproach.","The defendant plead guilty to five theft related charges. He was 43 years old and a former Chief of Police for the Town of Kentville. He had held a position of trust in the police department and used his position of authority to commit these offences. The total amount of money involved was $64,000.00. The defendant had received a combined sentence of four months consecutive for a total of twenty months incarceration in a provincial institution. He made no recommendation to the Correction Services as to where he would be incarcerated or when he would receive temporary leave of absence."
b_2014skqb81.txt,"Limitation of Actions – Mortgage – Saskatchewan Farmland SecurityHELD: When s. 12 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act was enacted it was the legislature’s intention that a mortgagee, to whom The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act applied, could suspend the limitation period clock from running and after serving a notice of intention to enforce its security, provided that within three years of such service the mortgagee made application to the court for an order under s. 11 permitting it to commence an enforcement action. If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again. The notice of extension in this case expired in 2009 and the limitation clock began to run again. The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce the respondent’s mortgage has expired and the registration of the mortgage is ordered discharged.","HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the registration of mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired. The respondent’s mortgage was registered at the Land Titles Office and continued to date as Interest Registration No. 106597705. The notice of extension had expired on the expiry of 150 days from the date of its service. The limitation period had been suspended on the filing of the February 28, 2006 notice of intention and remained suspended until the service of the subsequent notice of intent. The applicant argued that the purpose of the Farm Security Act was to prevent mortgagees from foreclosing on farmers who have a reasonable possibility of meeting their obligations under their mortgages and who are making sincere and reasonable effort to meet their obligations. The application for relief under s. 11(1) was dismissed."

Part of the order sought provided for the payment of solicitor fees by way of a contingency fee agreement negotiated with the applicant. The contingency fee agreement was never filed with the prothonotary. Granting the order relating to the settlement amount, but setting aside the contingency fee agreement, that Civil Procedure Rule 63.19(1) requires that all contingency fee agreements be filed with the prothonotary. As this was not done, the applicant's solicitor is only entitled to compensation as would have been payable in the absence of the contingency agreement.","The applicant sought approval of the court for a settlement of a crush injury to the right leg below the knee. The medical reports on file indicated that the infant had suffered a crushed injury in the absence of any contingency plan or contingency plan. No surgery was required and the infant was advised to return to his pre-accident activities. The Contingency Fee Agreement between the applicant's firm and his parents provided for the payment of 30% of the sum settled upon plus disbursements. That was task that was placed upon the taxing master when he was asked to have the account taxed. As this was not done, the Court was not prepared to allow any fee payable to the taxing master. The Chambers Judge had an onus to review the documentation on file prior to signing an order of this nature."
9_2014skqb386.txt,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction. Corrigendum received dated March 6, 2015 and added to fulltext. HELD: The appeal was granted.  1) Given the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) that the person who occupies the driver's seat is deemed to have care and Control, the trial judge considered whether the appellant had rebutted the presumption so as to rebut the presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. 2) The trial judge reviewed the relevant factors and found that the appellant was definitely in actual care or control. The only thing the accused added to viva voce evidence was the addition of the emergency brake, which would have to be released prior to the vehicle moving. This did not alter the fact that his vehicle was capable of almost immediate movement and as such, created the risk the section is designed to prevent. 3) The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, stayed the proceedings."
d_2001nsca44.txt,"The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol. The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial. Finally, there were no errors by the judge on any of the other grounds advanced for appeal.","Following a trial in the Supreme Court, before Justice Simon MacDonald and a jury, the appellant was convicted of four offences arising out of her operation of a motor vehicle. The appellant appealed her conviction, and raised numerous grounds of appeal. In none of these grounds did the appellant take the position that the jury's verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence."
5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.",HELD: The appeals were dismissed. The court found that the respondent had no standing to bring his application pursuant to s. 222(d) of the Act and that the Chambers judge had made errors in his approach to the application.
c_2005skqb166.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). The trial judge concluded that the impaired driving charge was stronger than the.08 and, in his opinion, a conviction only for impaired driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. In this case, the trial judge made no errors in law. The decision of the Provincial Court Judge was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue. The entry of a judicial stay on the.07 count was not a use to avoid the impaired driver issue. Volume of consumption falls within the provisions of s.253. The mechanism for doing so is the entering of a review of readings contained in Certificate of Analysis; and, if the accused appeals the conviction on the more serious charge and is successful, the matter may be remitted to the Provincial trial judge to determine whether a conviction should be entered on that charge."
4_1996canlii6841.txt,"The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","Husky Oil appealed a decision of the Revenue and Financial Services Board which upheld the assessment of sales tax. The respondent, under the provisions of the Education and Health Tax Act and the Department of Revenue and Finance Act, conducted an audit resulting in the assessment in the amount of $37,842.07. The appellant argued the board erred in its conclusion that the purchase of the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use in Saskatchewan and there was evidence before the Board that it was open to them to come to that conclusion. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of Board reversed. The appeal is allowed and Board reversed on the issue of the assessment. The Board's interpretation of the word 'published' asused in s. 5(1)(f) of the Act is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not warrant findings of fact made by the Board. The alternative does not focus on the extent to which the book or technical paper is produced, distributed or available to a sufficiently broad audience but rather the purpose for which it was produced, made available and available to those who wish to use the property for their educational, technical, cultural or literary purposes. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly. The decision of board member HELD:(1) The appeal allowed. The Court's role is restricted only to circumstances that the evidence did not warrant the findings of the Board by virtue of s. 8(1) of The Act. The board's finding that the Appellant fails to meet the requirements of s8(1(f) is appropriate to the jurisdiction conferred by s. 21(11) of THE Education and health tax act.  1) The Board determined as finding of fact that the documents in issue fell within the definition of tangible personal property as set out in the Act and is therefore not entitled to claim an exemption under s. 7(f). 2) The application of the statutory requirements in this case was based largely upon the interpretation adopted by the board. The Interpretation of the Words 'published','short' and 'open to review' is not applicable. 3) The respondent did not pay taxon what is referred to as 'Documentation charges'.  4) The Court found that the respondent failed to meet its requirements pursuant to the Act. It is the Court's view that on an appeal the facts are deemed to have been conclusively established by the evidence, which is the broad interpretation, which eliminates this inconsistency. The narrow interpretation eliminates the anomaly"
2011skca19.txt,"The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The appellant was convicted of assaulting his neighbour's son and given a conditional discharge with a probation period of 9 months. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench the judge quashed his conviction and ordered a new trial. The Crown appealed the conviction. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court found that the appellant was mistaken in his belief that he was in imminent danger and that his action was necessary in self-defence to be reasonable. It is not an error to believe that the accused's mistake of fact was reasonable. However, the trial judge did not err in the trap of preferring the evidence of one over the other and drew conclusions regarding what happened based on the whole of the evidence. Quite the contrary, the appellant's mistake was reasonable, one that an ordinary person using ordinary care could have made in the same circumstances. The appeal judge erred in both ways. The failure on the part of a trial judge to refer explicitly to certain evidence does not constitute an inconsistency. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning (holding that even if the appellant’s mistake of thought was reasonable he would have rejected the defence of self- defence on the basis that the use of pepper spray was not proportionate response). The appeal court also found that although the appellant had been afraid, he did not address the complainant”s statement that the finger incident occurred twice, which formed the basis for him to find that the instruction to leave the yard also occurred twice. These are seemingly minor matters but they were issues that the trial court had to resolve in order to gauge: (i) the actual threat, if any, faced by the accused; (ii) the reasonableness of the accused’ s belief that his was being threatened; and (iii) the proportionality of his response. The Court found that (1) the trial judges decision to not refer to the evidence in the context of the statement of fact and (2) the error in judgment (and in the wording of the decision) was not an unreasonable one. The Appeal judge reviewed the evidence and found that none of the conduct of the appellant amounted to an assault on the person of the Defendant, the defendant was not touched by the complainant nor did the complainant attempt or threaten by an act or gesture to apply force to the appellant. The decision was not based on an error of judgment but rather on the totality of evidence."
e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","The applicant was a casual employee with a Cerebral Palsy who was denied permanent employment. He claimed that the City did not want to give him a job because of his disability. He sought and was granted temporary employment in the construction department. The applicant successfully applied for and was awarded employment insurance in the amount of $8,902.00. The tribunal heard 5 days of testimony from witnesses and CUPE members. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the applicant had failed to take into account the fact that he was a 'year round worker' (Cerebral PALS) and that his job was to hauling materials with an eight-ton tandem truck (Tandem). The tribunal also found that it was not in the best interest of the applicant to have his employment terminated because of the entry-level position he occupied and the fact he was prone to repetitive back and forth movements that were difficult for him to perform. The discrimination was severe and resulted in the applicant receiving a pay differential of 4% less than other year round employees. The Applicant suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and significant injuries as a result of the job loss. He was unable to work and the impact on his ability to obtain employment insurance when he was no longer able to do so was devastating. He lost his disability pension, 401(k) and other pension savings. He suffered from memory loss and memory loss due to a cerebral palsy diagnosis. The disability was a contributing factor in his inability to work. It was also a factor in the inability of him to secure employment insurance."
9_2009nssc420.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault, use of a weapon, unlawful possession of a weapon and breach of a recognizance.

It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that the officer should have made an effort to clarify the informational component of the right to counsel.",The accused was charged with aggravated assault and use or threatened use of weapon. The police had been aware that the accused did not intend to be a cooperative witness and had sought admission of the accused's inculpatory statements to the police. The accused was given his Charter rights and was advised of his right to contact counsel without delay and right to duty counsel. He was then asked if he wanted to call a lawyer. The defence submitted that the Crown had not been aware of the misunderstanding and the accused had simply been too drunk to remember what happened that day. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached voluntarily. Counsel was required to make a clear and concise reply to the questions and the police did not fall below the threshold of exclusion. The Court reviewed the video evidence and found it was of a very intoxicated accused. He had stated that he did not want to be seen or heard by the police because he thought they were heavy drinkers. He also indicated that he would like to have legal counsel now. The Crown appealed the dismissal of the charge of assault on the accused which was dismissed. Appeal dismissed. The court held that it was a balancing act between the interests of the administration of justice and the preservation of a Charter right to be informed of and informed of one's rights. Access to counsel is the gateway of the Charter rights particularly in these circumstances where this statement is the only evidence to be offered by the Crown in seeking conviction. It would be egregious to allow admission of a videotaped statement into evidence.

The court found that the arbitrator's finding that the phrase in question was ambiguous and outlined the reasons why each of the competing interpretations might be chosen. This is an incorrect proposition of law. The arbitrator went on, in the alternative, to rely on the other provisions of the agreement; that is, he used one of the appropriate, and, indeed, first tools of statutory interpretation for an ambiguous phrase that is to interpret it in the context of the entire agreement."

There may have been a number of changes of circumstances which go far beyond the single issue on which the Appeal directed."

The child is the petitioner's son from a prior relationship. The petitioner plans to have the child live with his biological father in Edmonton so that he can get the specialized medical care that he requires. When the petitioner and the respondent separated, they consented to a judgment, which granted the petitioner custody of the child and gave access rights to the respondent. The consent judgment provided that the petitioner was to provide the respondent with 90 days notice of any proposed change in the child's residence. Notice of the upcoming move was provided to the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. The consent judgment does not require the petitioner to get an order before changing the child's residence. An application will be required by the petitioner to vary the access arrangements with the respondent.","The respondent had two children from two prior relationships. Her daughter was presently 16 years old and her son was 10 years old. Subsequent to the separation of the parties consent judgment provided that the petitioner would have custody of the child subject to an agreement she had entered into with the child's biological father Culford. The agreement stipulated that the respondent would have reasonable access to the child every second weekend from Friday evening to Sunday evening and one week in each of July and August. The parties had agreed that it would be in the best interests for the child to be with his biological father in Edmonton where he would have immediate access to medical therapy, consultation with his psychiatrist and advanced modes of therapy including scholastic, which are only available in large centres. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. Nothing in the judgment referred to above requires the petitioner to obtain such an order. It only provides that the father receive 90 days' written notice. The respondent was informed verbally of the proposed move in September or early October."

The order provided that when the husband retired, the wife would receive, as her vested share of his pension, 40% of his benefit. The order also provided that the parties could apply for further directions as necessary. After the husband's retirement, the wife sought to receive her share of the pension from the employer as a lump sum. The husband objected, claiming that he was entitled to any remaining benefit from her share in the event she should predecease him. The wife applied for directions. HELD: The wife is entitled to her share of the pension in any form permitted by the terms of the pension plan. She is also entitled to leave her interest in the pension to a named beneficiary, without reference to or the consent of the husband.","The parties married in 1952 and were divorced in 1984. The matrimonial property was settled by the parties in 1985. A consent order giving effect to the vesting order in December 1985 stated that the applicant was to receive a vested interest in the pension to the extent described in the order. The applicant did not consent to the lump sum benefit as she perceived the pension plan arrangement to be something of tontine. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The court preferred to treat the application as one for an order interpreting the previous order and consequential declarations and directions. The order provided for vesting to the applicable extent, depending on future event, namely, the date of his retirement or the date his death if it occurred before his retirement. 2)The 40% share, having vested in the applicant, is a share she may deal with without reference to,or the consent of, Russell. This order shall not be acted on until the expiration of 15 days and not then if there shall be an appeal."

She relied upon Civil Procedure Rules 15.07 and 15.08. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's application was an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her current circumstances. The proper remedy would be for the applicant to apply for a termination of the order under s. 48 of the Children and Family Services Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of a Family Court judge declining to rescind an order in 1993 for permanent care and custody of the appellant's granddaughter. The basis on which the application was made was that the appellant consented to or agreed with the 1993 order on the faith of the agency's then plan of care. Unfortunately, the adoption plans did not materialize because the mother had a drug dependency problem. The husband reported the problem to the Agency, which it sought its intervention because he alone could not care for the child. The appellant sought rescission on the authority of the Family Court Rule 15:07 and 15:08. The procedure adopted by the appellant was an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of the past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her present circumstances. The appeal was dismissed without costs."
b_2001canlii2619.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving causing bodily harm. Expert evidence was given based on blood samples taken after the accident that the accused was impaired; this opinion was based on two assumptions, namely, that the accused had not consumed alcohol within half an hour of the accident, nor after the accident. The Crown did not offer any evidence to prove these assumptions and, in fact, there was a three hour period prior to the accident where there was no evidence of what the accused, who did not testify, was doing. Acquitting the accused, that the expert evidence cannot be tendered by the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had been impaired. The remainder of the evidence against the accused was insufficient to prove the accused's doubt beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with criminal negligence causing death contrary to s.220 of the Criminal Code and unlawfully care or control of a motor vehicle while her ability to operate was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to ss.255(3) of the Code. The accused's testimony was adduced during voir dire hearing. HELD: The accused was acquitted. 1)The evidence did not support a conviction on the first count of the information. Since there was no evidence at the trial to prove the fact assumed, the expert evidence of extrapolation had no probative value. 2)The accused's evidence regarding the blood alcohol level of the victim was found to be in error. 3)The blood alcohol content of the accused's body at the time of the motor vehicle accident was at the equivalent of 216 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.  4)No medical evidence was obtained as a result of the accident. The blood alcohol reading at 12:10, 12:15, and 12:20 was accurate. 5)The only conclusion that was drawn was that the accused was not impaired was in the presence of alcohol during the time she was incapacitated by the alcohol.  6)The court was unable to determine whether the accused’s condition related to the death of the other two counts."
3_1999skqb140.txt,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","The only witnesses called at trial were the plaintiff and the defendant. The matter lasted one day. The plaintiff entered a defence of its claim for damages against the defendant, Hyndman, for the amount owing for payments on vehicles leased by the defendant from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by the plaintiff to these leased vehicles. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed.  1)There was no defence entered to the claim by Redhead against Standard and the defendants, Standard, having been noted for default, were awarded judgment against them in the amount of $63,267.49 for breach of contract for the outstanding lease payments and the outstanding parts and service account. 2)The plaintiff did not know how the repairs were authorized for Standard. All of the invoices marked unpaid and claimed at trial continued to be sent to the address for Standard and there was no confirmation between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. The defendant had not agreed to the contracts for the leased vehicles but would make payments. The actions taken by both the parties were taken for the benefit of the company in an attempt to keep it operational. As it turned out, neither Redhead nor Hyndwoman benefited from this arrangement for very long and both lost money.  3)Costs were awarded to the plaintiff for the unpaid repairs.  4)The defendant was awarded taxable costs."
4_1999skqb3.txt,"The plaintiff was the coordinator of post-secondary education programs for White Bear First Nation, between 1990 until his termination in May 1997. The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff. In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs. There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict. The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct. The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal. The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause. HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed. The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct. There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance. The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract. Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed. Although the plaintiff had been treated unfairly, the plaintiff had not shown that the employer was guilty of harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious conduct.","HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $12,394.22 plus pre-judgment interest and costs of the action. The court found that the plaintiff’s dismissal from his employment was for just cause. The plaintiff had not done his job well and sought damages for wrongful dismissal. He sought punitive or aggravated damages.  1)The plaintiff had been employed from year to year and his duties as guidance counsellor included supervising and supervising the administration of post secondary education programs. His employment was terminated in 1997 when he was still employed as co-ordinator of the program. He had not complied with the requirements of the Indian and Northern Affairs Canada Board of Directors. 2)Although he had been a relatively long term employee, the plaintiff had his qualifications and he was essentially entitled to no more than the contract provided for. He suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, embarrassment, loss of confidence and loss of income due to poor performance and lack of understanding of and appreciation for the work and the people he had served as a mentor to and for. 3)There was no evidence of insubordination by the board members. It was accepted that they had a moral duty to act in the best interest of their children and to provide appropriate support and encouragement to the plaintiff. 4)In addition to his salary, the defendant was to receive pre-judicial interest on the amount owing to the court."
e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","The parties met, married, made children and then separated. The respondent father is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins. They have not settled a division of matrimonial property. Issues [1] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments? HELD: 1) The respondent's income was determined to be $29,983 and he was in a small credit position which he could offset against ongoing maintenance but in amount no greater than $50 per month so as not to cause any inappropriate financial hardship on the children. When arrears by the payor occur, this Court often allows those arreaars to be paid monthly. See no reason why the overpayment by the payingor should not be treated in the same fashion in these circumstances.  2) Personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses (vi) Capital cost allowance on real property owned by the partnership; and (vii) Capital Cost allowance on personal property owned a partnership were added back to income in 2003, 2004 and 2005. Assuming that the father had been making the maintenance payments as ordered, he will be in small a credit position, able to offset against continuing maintenance, but in the amount of $50.00 per month because the children will continue to use the truck for a significant period of time. The father will be able to contribute to the children's education in the appropriate manner. 3) The Court reviewed the financial information in the years 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2006 and found that the respondent was in the small-credit position that he could have offset against any ongoing maintenance, and in amount such as $50, that the adjustment can be made at this time. It is not reason why an adjustment of child maintenance should be made when the issue was finally determined. Assuming the father has been making maintenance payments, he is in a relatively small credit spot which he can offset against the ongoing maintenance. Assuming he has been paying maintenance as ordered he will also be in a smaller credit position (which he can always offset against additional maintenance but not to the extent that $50), so as to not cause any unnecessary financial hardship for the children"

The issue here was responsibility for the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to compel production. Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized. An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention. Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs. It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","FIAT.

8_2013skqb397.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction. The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies were available only through the Federal Court.","The applicants have brought an application for writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, seeking unconditional release from the Riverbend Minimum Institution due to a threat to their respective liberties claiming the Correctional Service of Canada has violated their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in not allowing them to reside in a common housing unit so that they can participate in their long-standing, same-sex relationship outside of the public domain. HELD: 1) The applicants should have followed the grievance process on the issue of housing assignments. The applicants have been serving their 'life' or 'indeterminate' sentences at the Penitentiary and Sinobert has remained assessed as minimum security offender and has continued to be housed at minimum security Riverbender Institution. The Court assumes that neither of the applicants' situations have changed for the purpose of rendering this decision. 2) Rather than bringing a grievance under the Offender Complaint and Grievance System, both the applicants and Sinoboert chose to bring a habeAS corpus application to this Court in September 2013. Rather than bring a grievance pursuant to the Court's existing Rules of Court, which require that a party with a disability be represented on an application, the applicants should instead have followed a grievance process. They have been in the same housing unit for the past 3 years and have not filed a first-level grievance. It was obvious from the evidence the Court received concerning Sinoberts's physical and mental health and the Court’s observations of Sinobertor during the application that he was suffering from some kind of disability. These remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process. 3) In the unique circumstances of this case, with Sinoberti consenting and the respondent not really taking issue with the applicant’ s request, the Court allowed the applicant to make submissions on the application on Sinober’’ behalf as well as his own. That proved to be beneficial for everyone as towards the end of the argument both inmates had to be assisted by court official for blood sugar related situation that had culminated during the argument. Habeas corpus cannot be used to review the decision of the Correctional Services of Canada declining a housing reassignment request or the policy that all inmates found in a housing unit other than their own will be subject to disciplinary charges.

d_1991canlii4237.txt,"In this divorce action the petitioner sought to have a separation agreement entered into by the parties incorporated into the corollary relief judgment. The respondent sought to have the separation agreement set aside on the grounds of duress, undue influence or unconscionsability. The couple had a traditional marriage. The petitioner earned $48,000 per year. The wife did not work outside the home and suffered from severe arthritis. For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","The parties entered into a separation agreement for the purpose of increasing the maintenance provision and retaining the asset division. The husband argued that the agreement was unconscionable, harsh and fraudulent and that it required an order varying the terms of the contract or agreement as the court desired. The wife also sought costs of disposition. The parties did not agree with the $1,100 valuation placed on the agreement and both parties agreed that the maintenance award was of such a low amount that it was unconsceivable to bind the wife to such a level.

This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found. 4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages. A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues. 5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case.","This was an application by the defendant for an order pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction severing the issues of liability and damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The Court's discretion is general and there must be compelling reasons before a trial of this type will be granted.

8_2008nssc358.txt,"The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally. Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","The applicant’s business was incorporated and the parties shared joint custody of the children. The Corollary Relief Judgment incorporated an agreement that the parties would share joint custody with the children and share parenting duties equally. The respondent asked the court to vary the level of child support based on the former wife”s increased income and a decline in her income. The applicant applied to have her RRSP income to be paid back to the date of the parties separation and should retroactive award be granted.

The parties agreed to pay child support of $5,000 per month based on their income for child support purposes. 2) The respondent was to pay spousal support of approximately $500 per month. 3) The applicant was to forthwith pay $2,000 based on her income over the past four years. If the matter was brought back before the Court, the Court was to consider whether the additional child support should be varied based on whether the former spouse had increased her income and whether she should also consider adjusting the amount for spousals and UCCB as she travelled a great deal in order to support her business. 4) The court was not convinced that the applicant would suffer undue hardship by having her share of the child support offset against the respondent” s payment."

The appellant contended that the judge had applied the wrong test for committal.

2010skpc153.txt,"The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations. The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.","The accused was charged with fishing without a licence contrary to s. 11(1) of the Fisheries Regulations and with operating a fishing licence while disqualified or prohibited contrary to section 13 of the Act. At the close of the Crown's Charter application, defence brought a Charter application challenging the constitutionality of s. 35 of The Fisheries Act, 1994. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of the act. Counts 1, 2 and 3 were dismissed. The Court found that there was no violation order within s. 27. The accused had a valid fishing licence, valid on its face, and he acted in compliance with that licence. The issue is whether the Minister had the authority under s. 23 to prohibit the accused from applying for or obtaining a licence. 1) It is irrelevant that the fishing licence was valid at the relevant times. The fishing licence is held in good standing. 2) The Court did not find that the accused possessed any other valid driving licence or driving licence, and the prohibition took effect on the day on which it was served by registered mail. 3) The prohibition is void ab initio, having been made without authority."

b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary the father's maintenance for her daughters, Nicole and Kirsti. She also applied for determination that the father was in arrears of maintenance and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. The trial judge found that although the mother's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than their father's, they were still entitled to maintenance. The father discontinued child support in September 2006. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court found that the trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father and that there was no order for retroactive maintenance. As the mother had not rebutted her father's decision to pay child support, the court was in error in finding that she was no longer entitled to support."
d_2018skpc6.txt,"HELD: On the basis of the evidence presented by the parties’ experts and in absence of an express term in the contract, the court read in an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price and awarded the plaintiff such portion of the amount sought as was fair and reasonable. The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work.","Reliable Truck Trailer Inc. is a mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company situated in Pense, Saskatchewan. In 2015 it entered into an oral agreement with Super Save, Inc. in which it agreed to provide, on 'call out', repair services for Super Save's fleet of trucks and associated Equipment. Between the summer of 2015 and June of 2016, it provided shop supplies, parts, and services on a number of occasions. During this relationship, the defendant paid Reliable's invoices as they were presented, but ceased to pay as they became due. Reliable was not prepared to accept the lesser amount and it now brings this action to recover the amount that it says is due. HELD: The plaintiff has received some but not nearly all of the money that was sought. The defendant has been successful in reducing the amount of money sought but not entirely. The plaintiff asks that the court grant it out of pocket expenses that it incurred in having to retain an expert to give evidence on the issue of a fair and reasonable price. 1) The amount sought was unreasonable. 2) In businesses such as the plaintiff's, the industry anticipates that either travel time to and from the work location is regularly billed and paid for or alternatively, that minimum period of time is charged for the goods and services, based not necessarily on what either party had thought were the respective rights and obligations of the other, but rather, based on the evidence of experts who played no role in the provision of those goods. The estoppel by convention argument advanced by the plaintiff is advanced. 3) The plaintiff is entitled to its costs in any event of the contract. 4) In the absence of an express term in a contract, which stipulated that the parties agreed to charge a fair price, the plaintiff had to ensure that time it charged was accurate, and if it did not, then it has breached its contract with the defendant. 5) The Court was satisfied that the plaintiff was entitled to costs in all of these circumstances.

Although a statement of claim was served on the defendant, it's insurer was advised by the plaintiff's counsel that she would not proceed to judgment except on 10 days written notice.

This letter was not seen by him although he was in the process of putting together material for a solicitor to file a defence.

Allowing the application and setting aside the default judgment, that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse on the part of the defendant for not filing the defence.

6_2010skqb51.txt,"The Bankrupt applies for his discharge from bankruptcy. The discharge is opposed by the Credit Union and the trustee. The Bankrupt was a cattle farmer. He financed this undertaking principally through the Credit Union. HELD: The Bankrupt will be discharged conditional upon payment of $8,000 in addition to surplus income of $2,250 to his estate for the benefit of his creditors. He should be able to comply with this order within 3 years.  1) The bankrupt is 42 years old and a first time bankrupt. He is employed with an excavating company and earns $20 an hour and works as much as 160 hours per week. He is paying $1,000 per month on his mortgage and is trying to catch up on mortgage arrears to stave off foreclosure. He is working hard and living a subsistence life. However, he still has some funds left with an income level above the Superintendent's Standard for a family of two. 2) His assets are less than $.50 on the dollar. His creditors were put to the unnecessary expense by his frivolous or vexatious defence of their claim and he failed to comply with the duties of a bankrupt by failing to produce proper records and assist the trustee to the fullest. He has been abusive and disrespectful throughout.","The bankrupt applied for his discharge from bankruptcy. His statement of affairs showed assets of $171,255 (mostly exempt or encumbered) against unsecured debts totalling $433,750 and secured debt of $150,000. The trustee opposed the bankrupt's discharge application and sought payment of costs and a conditional order of discharge. The bankrupt's lawyer objected to the discharge on multiple grounds, including his intentional failure to provide proper documentation to the trustee and raising questions about surplus income obligations. HELD: The bankrupt was granted a discharge. He was permitted to work part-time and earn a modest income. The court found that the bankrupt had a bona fide interest to the creditors in that he did not intend to use his exempt farm assets for his purposes. The bankruptcy is intended to assist the 'honest but unfortunate debtor' and his actions as a result of the crisis did not constitute vexatious legal defence. It is impossible to attribute to the bankrupt the value of his cattle sales and the fact that they occurred well before the bankrupt embarked upon his assignment as Superintendent of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA) required a substantial order of payment in the amount of $12,000 to be paid to his estate within three years.

e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the chambers judge erred in failing to address the question of whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(f) of the Guidelines. The only issue on this appeal is the order that the appellant pay 73% of the children's extracurricular activities, which are covered by the basic child support order of $2,532 per month. The order was made in part by the appellant's application to the Court of Queen's Bench for an order requiring him to pay his proportionate share of the extracursurricular expenses. The application was based on an analysis of the respondent's income and the amount of child support payable. The chambers judge referred only to the costs of Ashley's Tae Kwan Do and soccer, Mitchell's soccer and Makayla's voice lessons and they were all extraordinary. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed."
c_2002skqb508.txt,"A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of certain food services at the University of Saskatchewan. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties had failed. The employer had advised the Board that it was not prepared to make the agreement retroactive. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)The Board's decision to favour the union and make the wage increases fully retroactive was patently unreasonable. 2)It would be unsound to base entitlement to retroactive benefits on the serendipitous signing of a collective agreement or the signing of Board decision imposing one. The Board did not have the luxury of hindsight or the opportunity to look back and see if there was a pattern. 3)The test of'substantial compliance' would have to be considered in the context of the employer's claim to jurisdiction (Interpretation and Analysis); whether the board breached natural justice or procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages; whether the employer obeyed its contractual obligation and failed to comply with its statutory provisions. 4)The employer was a merchant. His products were presumably priced in such a way as to reflect in part the labour costs involved in delivering them to the public. The importance of a wage rise, retroactive, would seem to be of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. The decision to allow the graduated employees to receive their back pay was not patently unreasonably late."

At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed.

If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3).

As the Crown proceed by indictment, he was subject to imprisonment for term not exceeding ten years on each conviction. He was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 4 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA prohibition order and a 20 year SOIRA compliance order. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. The narrow application of s.490.013(2.1) rendered by the sentencing court's interpretation of it, which required the accused not to comply for life, was overturned. The Court of Appeal stated that Parliament clearly intended s. 480.013 to apply more broadly to any offender who commits multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or all together. The order must be set aside and replaced with a lifetime SOIra compliance order.[1][2] The Crown's appeal from the sentencing decision's order pursuant to s. 485.013 of the Code, that the accused committed multiple designated acts, was allowed and the accused was responsible for more than one 'designated offence'. Sexual assault is a designated offence. Where an offender is convicted of a designated or designated offence, s.476(1)(a) requires the sentence is concomitantly pronounced for multiple 'designation' convictions and the offender's criminal record discloses no prior convictions for a 'designate offence' such as sexual assault. An order made under s 490.013 (1) or (2) (b) ends 20 years after it was made if the maximum term of imprisonment for the offence is 10 or 14 years; and, 2.1"" Duration of Order applies for life if the person was convicted of, or found not criminally responsible on account of a mental disorder for, more than 1 offence referred to in paragraph (a), (c), (d) or(e) in the definition of a 'Designated offence in s.485(1).

8_2006skqb274.txt,"DIGEST The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000. HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit. 3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","The appellants were convicted by a provincial court judge of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and the Health Of Animals Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors.

b_2004skqb156.txt,"The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle. There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3) Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.

The parties agree that the appellant is defined by the Act as a non-earner who was involved in a motor vehicle accident in July 1998 and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as skidder operator. HELD: The appellant is entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided for by s. 203(5) of the ACT and Regulation 101. The appellant was awarded interest on the value of his benefits from June 1, 2001 to date. 1) The Act provides for calculation of IRB for the first 180 days and for the 181st and subsequent days. Section 117 and the corresponding regulations provide the mathematical formula to determine the IRB. The case law provides for a determination whether the non- earner was deprived of an employment insurance benefit in the First 180 days. 2) The legislation strives for one's earning reality. It strives for an earning reality that results in results that reflect the time that the victim would have actually been employed. This includes working for a logging and milling business, when staff are not in the woods, they are utilized in the mill, and Montgrand would have worked, on average, 90 days. The average work week was 34.25 hours. The reduction in the period of employment be reduced to factor in inclement weather was not less than the IRBs calculated under s. 116 of the SGI and received by Montgrand in the first180 days. 3) The issue is determining when Montgrand will have actually worked and that finding has been made. The wording of s. 117(4) is clear. The Act strives for the earning reality of one. Non-earners in the past may well become someone whose employment income, but for the accident, would be more than the 'weighted average approach'. If a claimant has proved on a balance of probabilities that the promised employment reflects his or her earning reality, a poor past record ought not to preclude the claimant from an IRB that reflects his earning reality and the GYEI from which it is derived. 4) SGI submits that the reduction in time of employment is reduced to a factor in winter.

6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","The issue for the Court was whether Tristen was a child of the marriage as defined by the Divorce Act (and, if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). The parties married in 2001 and separated in 2008. The parenting and support issues concerning the biological child have been resolved. The respondent has a child, born April 3, 2004. The issues are the biological son of the respondent and the respondent's relationship with the child. The question of whether the respondent is a parent to Tristanen is a question objectively because most of the factors listed would evolve over time and therefore it is implied based on common sense, that parental status is earned over a reasonable passage of time. Even an expressed intention to assume responsibility would not be sufficient in some cases of very short marriages especially those involving an active natural parent."
4_2010skqb193.txt,"The litigation revolved around a claim by the plaintiffs for damages that resulted from a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006. In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery. HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence. Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery. In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery. The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars.","FIAT: The plaintiffs were operating a tractor unit bearing Manitoba licence plates and pulling a semi-trailer bearing an Alberta licence plate. On August 16, 2006, six days shy of the two year limitation period, the plaintiffs claimed that DDH, the female plaintiff had not recovered from her injuries and damages were accruing but the extent thereof was not yet known. The defendants applied to compel the plaintiffs to provide particulars pursuant to Rule 164 of The Queen's Bench Rules. Each defendant denied liability and raised the legal issue of which insurer and provincial insurance regime has jurisdiction and potential liability, if any, given that the Province of Saskatchewan's auto insurance regime creates a no-fault driver regime and has agreements with each of the neighbouring insurance companies to assess their positions and prepare for discovery. HELD: The defendants' application was granted. Both the plaintiff and the defendant's counsels had furnished draft orders to the court, save and excepting the request for costs in the cause. It would be premature to award costs at this stage.

5_2002skqb378.txt,"All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.","The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the parties provide the receipts for these expenses as they are incurred and the father pay his 59% share of those expenses within 10 days of receiving them. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the s. 7 expenses should be made retroactive; 2) whether child support should be retroactive given the mother's limited income; and 3) the costs of the child care activities. The mother's contribution to the child's activities should be 59% being his proportionate share; and 4) if the mother was not prepared to allow any retroactive s. expenses, the illness must relate to her custodian, not to third party."

The receiver manager of the registered owner (the numbered company) under the Bankruptcy Act and the instrument appointed receiver on behalf of the secured creditor and mortgagee (HSBC Bank) applied for a vesting order. The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year. HELD: The vesting order was granted. 1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so. In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87. 2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor. The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment.","FIAT. The respondent registered owner under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, 1985, c. B-3, as am. by the bankruptcy and insolvency act, S.C. 1992, c.(27) s. 2 and instrument appointed receiver of the registered owner on behalf of the HSBC Bank, a secured creditor and mortgagee of certain real property of the Registered Owner applies for a vesting order with respect to a sale of the real property.

2_1999canlii12455.txt,"The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support. Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, aged 13, 13, 15, 16 and 17. The primary issue between the parties was custody of the children. Ancillary to and dependent upon the determination of the custody issue, child support was the quantum of child support that would be payable by either party. HELD: The children were in joint custody with the mother. They resided an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The mother was to receive counselling. The father was to have access only one weekday and one weekday. The daughter was to visit the father only on alternate weekends and one or two weeks each year. The court found it in the children's best interests that they be in the joint custody of both of them and that they reside an equal time each time. The evidence showed that the increased costs of shared custody had a negative effect on their ability to effectively co-parent. Although the mother expressed some desire to relocate to Alberta to marry a speech language pathologist, she did not demonstrate any change in her circumstances. The child was to primarily reside with the father."
c_2016skqb269.txt,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","The accused was charged with failing to ensure the health and safety of its employee by failing to instruct the employee on how to unplug a blocked receiving pit. The employee suffocated after stepping onto the grain in the pit. Viterra is charged with three counts of failing to provide proper training and supervision to ensure that the employee exercised due care and diligence to avoid the contravention. The mass of material emphasized the dangers, and the importance of following the safety procedures, rather than burying them. The Court of Appeal did not accept the Crown's position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proves the actus reus of failed to ensure safety of an employee. HELD: The Court held that the evidence of the employee who died was found to be unreliable. Based on the evidence provided by the employee, it was found that the employer failed to adequately supervise the employee. As the employee had not been adequately trained in due diligence, the Crown could not rely on the employee's recollection of what he said. The matter was therefore left to the Court to determine whether the employer adequately prepared the employee for the job. As far as the employee was concerned, his failure to supervise and supervise him resulted in the death of him. As long as he was making these observations, the employee would not have been able to protect himself from the potential for harm."
c_2011nssc20.txt,"The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson. They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","The defendant moved for summary judgment on evidence, alleging that the motor vehicle accident which occurred in 1998 was caused by an inherent defect in the design and manufacture of the vehicle being driven by the other plaintiff, Johansson. Both Johansson and Jody were paid damages for the injuries they sustained. The amount paid to each of the plaintiffs was acknowledged in writing and they each signed a release acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. The defendants now claim damages for injuries they suffered as a result of the accident which they allege was caused, by the careless and negligent actions of the defendant in the manufacture of of the car involved.

1999skqb29.txt,"In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","FIAT. The applicants sought an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development and from further considering an application for discretionary use permit by Kathy and Gary Palidwar for private hotel development connected with the community facility known as the Evergreen Centre. HELD: The application was granted in part. The respondents were hoteliers who operate five of the six hotels and motels within the community and who have joined together in an informal association. They requested that the zoning board and city council review the proposal, as it was a project involving an existing public facility and they were concerned that the proposal would adversely affect the already existing hotel population. The proposal was submitted to the Town Council for a tentative sale of public lands and the introduction of Bylaw 756/99. There was no evidence presented at the meeting that the applicants had acted in bad faith or that they had obtained information from the respondents that was kept secret.

2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.",The appellant sought a declaration to strike the appellant's claim under s. 36 of the Constitution Act. The chambers judge struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the court found that the appellant had not broken its constitutional commitments; the claim should not be struck summarily; and the appeal court did not find any error in the trial judge's approach.

Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable. An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties.","The plaintiff obtained an oral agreement for the payment of a fixed commission.

e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The court found the petitioner’s Federal Child Support Guidelines were accurate and directed that he pay interim child support in the amount of $1,949 and interim spousal support in $5,250. The petitioner was successful in obtaining medical residency in Canada. The respondent was a pediatric pediatric pediatric critical care fellowship physician. He resided in Regina for several years. The family immigrated to Canada in 2001. They resided in Saskatoon until 2014, when they moved to Regina. They then parted for the final time in April 2014. The court granted the respondent interim primary residence of the petitioner and ordered that he should pay interim support for D.K. in the sum of $5k per month. The parties then moved to Ottawa, where they again took up residence. This time, the petitioner was no longer residing with the respondent. They subsequently relocated to Ottawa. The Court found that the petitioner had an income of approximately $309,700 and, after unsuccessfully applying for and obtaining an answer and counter petition, both of which were opposed to the petitioner seeking shared parenting and an equal division of family home and property. The latter claimed that he suffered from health and safety concerns related to his son. The administration of the federal child support guidelines was found to be in breach of the parties’ separation agreement. HELD: On balance, the court found that both the petitioner children were doing well in their chosen field of medicine. The fact that the respondent was able to access the petitioner son during the day alleviated some of the concerns of the mother. The child was doing well academically and had a better chance of obtaining employment in Canada if he was permitted to travel to Pakistan. The issues were resolved by a reasonable compromise and the respondent would have been permitted to pursue her career in medicine. While the petitioner may have had more time to spend with the child, the reality is that the child was not receiving the best quality of care in the world when he was living with the petitioner."

7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the respondent held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit union became a tenant at sufferance when it failed to remove the quonal. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal. The Credit Union appealed. Appeal allowed. It was common ground that the defendant owner of the building sold to a third party in the spring of 2001. However, the building was not removed from the property until the fall of 2002. Gari took possession of the Building and rented it out for storage. Its actions following the failure of Lakeland did not reflect the terms of its lease with Gari. Denying permission to remove a building which was being left on the property would put persons with interests in land at an unfair disadvantage vis-à-vis financers and allow financers to effectively'store' fixtures on the other property. It would also put persons at a disadvantage vis a person with an interest in land such as Gari because there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them."

The Crown alleged that the trial judge erred in law by excluding two breath samples taken following the respondent's arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights. During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence. HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case. The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects.","The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of impaired driving. The Crown claims the learned trial judge erred in excluding two breath samples taken after the arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) While the trial judge reviewed the relevant factors and found nothing which constituted objective grounds for setting aside the acquittals on the impaired driving charge, the Crown did not question the credibility of either of the officers. 2) The trial judge failed to take into account the appellant's honest belief that he was impaired and the objective grounds to move from suspicion to objective belief. The appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol as shown by the breath samples. 3) The evidence of the impairment was found to be stronger support for the Crown's contention that the appellant had consumed alcohol than he realized. 4) The appellant was found not to have shown any impairment on the breath sample. The observations of the arresting officer upon which the officer formed reasonable and probable grounds that the accused was impaired were both subjective and objective. The officer was of the opinion that the impaired driver was showing signs of impairment and she concluded that his ability to drive motor vehicle as a result of the U-turn was impaired. 5) The breath samples were taken as soon as practicable after the time the accused left the intersection and at the same time, while his ability in driving was impaired, he was still able to detect alcohol on his breath. 6) The accused was given a breath sample after which he was taken to the detachment. The accused sat in his vehicle with the door open and his left leg out while he unsuccessfully searched for his driver's licence and registration. This is not a position from which swaying would normally be observed. The fact that he is co-operative and cooperative does not negate the otherwise observable symptoms of stumbling and confusion and having difficulty locating documents."
d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","The Crown sought an adjournment of the trial to allow time for a review of recently disclosed documents. During the trial, defence counsel disclosed the existence of approximately 1,900 documents. The Crown sought to have the trial adjourned for a further time to allow the discovery of the documents and the disclosure of the other documents. In the intervening weeks, Crown counsel disclosed to defence counsel that the Crown had compiled a database of all the documents that it believed were relevant to the defence of the accused. In this case, the Crown did not believe the accused that he trafficked in cocaine or that he was conspiring to traffic in cocaine. In fact, Crown Counsel had erroneously stated that the accused had possession of a large quantity of steroids only. In his written response to defence, the defence counsel argued that Crown counsel should have given more time to the Crown. In reviewing the documents, the Court concluded that the appropriate remedy to address the late and non-disclosure issue was to set aside the trial and new trial. HELD: The Adjournment Request was granted. The Court ordered a new trial on the basis of the late disclosure of documents and requested that the trial be adjourned. The matter be set aside and a second trial ordered. As the Crown counsel had not been informed that the Proceeds of Crime Unit was working on the same file or that it had amassed a large amount of data, it was not possible to assess the undisclosed documents to determine whether the undisclosed information could have affected the verdict. A new trial is the only remedy available."
d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.","The plaintiff claimed damages for a motor vehicle accident which occurred when the defendant's police vehicle turned left in front of her vehicle. She claimed that the headlights were not in operation when it approached the intersection and that she was contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning without turning on the headlights. The defendant testified that he was in Cherry Brook, New Brunswick, but was not aware of the intersection when the accident occurred. He claimed that he had passed the plaintiff's vehicle at a dark section of highway and that he did not notice the police vehicle move directly in the front of him. The plaintiff claimed that she had been blindsided by the vehicle's headlights when she was driving. She also claimed that there was a lapse of time between one-half hour and forty-five minutes before she came to the intersection. Liability for the motor Vehicle Accident was assessed and determined to be in the range of 0.1 to 1.5 times the permitted range. The accident was caused solely through the negligence of the defendant in turning the vehicle in the direction the defendant was travelling. The destruction of the exhibits was not an error of judgment. The cause of action for the plaintiff to have been negligent is bad faith. It could be described as an erroneous act or negligent act but accept that the plaintiff is contributory to the accident."
2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","The wife sought to have the matrimonial home divided so that husband could have one half of the only asset the family had. She also sought an exemption for his mortgage, which they never owned, and all of the assets which he had before the marriage. Husband ordered to pay $1,945.00 against matrimony home. The wife's petition was successful. The husband was awarded $25,000.00. HELD: Judgment for the wife. 1)The matrimonial home was divided equally. The dividing of matrimolonial property by the wife did not make this case unusual. The court applied a 30% deduction to their value leaving $6,690.00 for a total of $8,690 and added to the accrual to a Sun Life policy during the same period of $2,200 for $890.00, one-half of which accrues to each of the parties or $4,445.00 and the other half accrued to each party or $5,445 ($4,446)). The matrimoronial home was jointly owned with his mother and was exempt property. 2)Had the wife filed a counter petition there would have been no division, no trial and no excessive legal costs but the judgment was in favour of the husband."
b_1990canlii4176.txt,"This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff had worked for 28 years for the defendant as a driver making deliveries to customers. The defendant dismissed the plaintiff for 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The plaintiff had taken longer coffee and lunch breaks than were allowed, and had taken unauthorized breaks for which he had then been paid overtime by the defendant. For the defendant, that the dismissal was justified. The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules.","The plaintiff was employed by Sears as driver and driver's helper for 28 years. He was dismissed from his employment without notice in 1988. He claimed that he was entitled to an unpaid supper break on the basis of his hours of work and overtime. He also claimed that overtime was excessive and he was terminated for his excessive work hours. The plaintiff claimed that his breaks were for his meal and he should have known there were other breaks available. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's dismissal was justified because he failed to comply with company policy regarding breaks and overtime and because he was late for work. Awarding the plaintiff $15.00 for an hour of work performed after 3:45 p.m., that day, and for an additional hour during lunch, he was also entitled to a 15 minute break for his break. The claim was dismissed without notice. HELD: The defendant's argument that the employer was justified in dismissing the plaintiff was rejected. 1)The plaintiff knew the hours of his work and the overtime policies and the manner in which they were enforced were serious issues for the plaintiff. He suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and was hospitalized for 22 days. 2)There was no reasonable excuse for the breaches of the company's policies. There was no evidence that the breaks were excessive or necessary to justify termination. 3)The evidence did not support a reasonable explanation for the breach of the policies. The evidence was conclusive that the company was regularly enforcing the policies in respect to breaks and periods of work. The fact that the plaintiffs had taken longer breaks during their work day did not disqualify them for termination. 4)The employer was required to consider the impact on the compay in the first place. The plaintiffs had been inconvenienced and the impact was severe. It was clear that the defendant was concerned about the long-term abuse of breaks. The breaks were often longer than they should have been and the plaintiffs were required to take breaks at other times during the work day. The company was also required to monitor their attendance at various restaurants and barbecues. 5)There is no evidence of any breach of company policy related to breaks or overtime. The standard of care given by the drivers and helpers was met by the employer at every meeting and every meeting. The employer was expected to monitor the drivers' attendance at restaurants and to provide guidance to the drivers as to when and how to best supervise and report to the employer if any breaks were breached. The administration of the policy was also considered."
5_2011nssc53.txt,"A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","The father sought party and party costs against his son. The father sought to have his solicitor and client costs paid out of the estate. The issue was whether the wills were mutual and that no agreement against revocation could be implied. The deceased's estate failed to provide an accounting. The central issue in the father's application was not about the meaning of his mother's will but about the implied promise against revocation, which his father breached by making a will in favour of his sister after his mother died. It was about the possibility of that failure, which was brought to the attention of the mother's daughter. As a result, the applicants now act on their own. HELD: The applications were not 'estate litigation' but rather a litigation between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them. The purpose of an award of costs is to provide the successful party with partial but substantial indemnity against legal fees measured by what would ordinarily be charged to a client for the kind of work undertaken on behalf of the successfulparty in the actual case. In light of the present position of the father and his daughter, those three parties will bear their own costs.  It was necessary for the estate to participate in the application because it originally involved questions about Mrs. Hand's property, it involved demand for accounting, and the late Mr. Thomas Burchell, Q.C., was subpoenaed to give evidence about both the administration of the Estate and the wills he drafted. The application was sham and the father was now acting on his own. He was represented in his personal claim by the lawyer who had no involvement with the issues about estate accounting."
b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","HELD: The Court found the plaintiff had proven that he was defamed and accepted the defendants' defence of qualified privilege. The defendants had failed in their duty to provide an adequate workplace environment. The plaintiff had worked for the University of Saskatchewan since the beginning of his career as an assistant professor and later became director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH). As director, he was responsible for the operation of the hospital and for its facilities. He was also the person ultimately responsible for insuring a harassment free workplace. The administrator of the VTH, who was also a CUPE member, was also charged with failing to prevent harassment and was found to have been an active participant in the harassment himself. The Court accepted the defence of privilege by the defendants. HELD: 1) The plaintiff was found not guilty. The court found that the plaintiff was not defamed but found him to be expendable and had a duty to act as a 'protector' to the reputation of the institution and to its employees. The impugned wording of the grievance was all the more troubling because the plaintiff sincerely believed he was diligently following the hospital's back to work program and believed that the words were published, meaning they were communicated to at least one person other than the plaintiff. The tort is one of strict liability. 2) The Court held that there was no evidence that the administrator actively harassed the plaintiff or that he actively interfered in the workplace. It was only the Court's view that he had a jurisdictional duty to prevent and prevent intentional interference with the institution's reputation and that the actions of his employer constituted intentional interference. Jurisdiction over the conduct of witnesses was also breached. The accused was found negligent in failing to locate the source of the evidence raised by the plaintiff and the defendants and found him guilty of intentional interference and breach of contract. The claim was dismissed."
8_1998canlii13830.txt,"An appeal of conviction on a charge of dangerous driving on the grounds the trial judge erred in holding that statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in the criminal proceedings; and in holding the statements could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police and therefore were voluntary and admissible. The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal. Objections to the admissiblilty of the accused's statements based upon the Charter raise a different issue and considerations from the application of common law principles and a different conclusion may have been reached.","The appellant appealed his conviction on a charge of dangerous driving. He had attended a police station to report an accident and reported to a Constable Louvel of the Regina City Police that he was the driver of the vehicle involved in a 1996 motor vehicle accident. The Constable had earlier received the statement of other witnesses involved in the accident. At issue was whether or not the Highway Traffic Act obligation to give a report to the police renders any statement made during the report involuntary. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial in the Provincial Court was ordered. 1)Had the Charter issues been properly raised and arguedbefore the learned trial judge, a conclusion different from the one reached based solely upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness may well have resulted. 2)The appellant's statement after the voir dire was conclusive in that it was not a voluntary statement and therefore ought to be ruled inadmissible. The trial judge could not say that the question arises in this case as to whether the question arose in this event as towhether or not The Highway Traffic act obligation to giving a reportto the police rendered any statement during the accident report involuntary, for that reason do not find the statements made by the appellant to be involuntary. 3)Had certain Charter issues had been properly raise and argued before the learned judge, then a conclusion similar to the one she reached (based solely upon common lawprinciples of voluntariiness) may well also have resulted, a result different from that reached (and possibly conclusively upon the conviction of the accused)."

9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","The accused plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death. He was driving a motor vehicle that was operating in the manner dangerous to the public contrary to s. 249(4) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was sentenced to imprisonment in the community for 90 days. 1)The accused was not intoxicated at the time of the accident and had not consumed any alcohol or drugs. The accident occurred at a northerly direction and was not controlled by traffic lights. 2)The only blood alcohol level in the victim was at.180. The accused had consumed a significant quantity of alcohol and was in no shape to drive a vehicle. The impact on his passengers was devastating and he was in danger to himself and to the community. 3)Although the accused was 19 years of age and had a minor youth record, he had six speeding convictions on his highway traffic record, two of which were on his record. He had been involved in night of drinking and partying without sleep and had been consuming alcohol. The Crown suggested a sentence in the low end of the range was appropriate. 4)Although his driving was not extremely erratic or bizarre, his actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his consumption of alcohol appeared to be either the major cause or contributing factor to his death."
9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The parties reached an impasse on the required disclosure and sought various orders. The defendants sought an order for the Court to exercise its discretion and sever the plaintiffs' claim between liability and damages. The plaintiffs also sought an Order that certain paragraphs of the plaintiff's claim be struck. HELD: The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages was dismissed. The court's inherent jurisdiction is founded on the Court of Queen's Bench Rule 261 and the Rule 215(1) of The Queen's Court of Appeal. As well, the defendants argued that they have developed their own SR&ED application process by cultivating relationships with accounting firms, industry associations, post-secondary learning institutions and various business organizations. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants’ obligation to maintain this confidence and the defendants could be liable to the accounting firm should it breach that confidence. The Court reviewed the relevant rules and found they did not constitute multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of the Queen’s Bench Act. The decision to strike portions of the plaintiffs’ claim was also reviewed."
d_2016skpc19.txt,"HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with possession of child pornography, contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code. The accused was a member of the Internet Child Exploitation Unit (ICE) and testified that he monitored file sharing networks for subjects who were accessing, possessing, or sharing child pornography. The ICE unit was involved in the investigation. The Court testified that it was common for persons accessing the Internet to access a particular file sharing network (e.g. a laptop computer, desktop computer, or similar file sharing program) to access the same physical location. As the Internet is a global network, and therefore, it is not centralized, the file sharing software can't be trusted to have the same serial number on its installation. The Office of the Chief testified that if two people, in the same house downloaded Shareaza on their separate computers, they would have different G.U.I.D. numbers on their installation. HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of accessing child pornography because the internal IP of the computer was tied to that VIN number, MAC address and the physical MAC address of that particular computer was non-password protected. As a result, the Court concluded that both the accused's computer and the Internet address used by the sharing network were the same files and that the common denominator of all the activity was the same IP address."
7_2013skqb67.txt,"The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","HELD: The court granted interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month for three children. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit of October 2012. The petitioner did not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and suggested it should terminate June 27, 2013. The parties did not reach an agreement on all issues. The court reviewed the contents of the document and indicated it could not be relied upon until ruled on its admissibility. The issues include parenting, child support and spousAL support. HELD: 1) The respondent was granted interim exclusive possession of the family home. 2) The petitioner was awarded spousals of $1,200.00 per month and $2,800.00 of child support. 3) The parties had three children, with the petitioner earning a Guideline income of $87,178.00. The mother had Guideline incomes of $18,884.00 and the respondent a P&P of $327.00; the parties had joint custody of the children.  4) The common law partner for the purposes of The Income Tax Act could have a bearing on the ability to claim the AED tax credit. 5) The court was satisfied that the parties could reach an interim agreement on seven issues. While it may be that parties in a settlement meeting reach a consensus on a number of issues, the petitioner does not suggest that all outstanding issues were resolved at the meeting. The meeting was without prejudice. The respondents indicated they would not review the entire document and would seek to have the issue of continued possession reviewed upon 14 days notice."
a_1995canlii4000.txt,"The Appellant/Defendant, Bennett appealed a judgment resulting from a jury trial. At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings. The Respondent/Plaintiff cross-appealed on the issue of whether the trial judge should have directed the jury to deduct sick leave benefits from her past loss of income. Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","The defendant applied for damages for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile collision. The jury trial was limited to assessing damages by the defendant's expert evidence. The plaintiff sustained multiple injuries including concussion, whiplash, fractured ribs, contusions and abrasions. She was rendered unconscious and remained in a state of post-traumatic amnesia for approximately 4 hours. The trial judge allowed the plaintiff's testimony to be put on the jury in the amount of $409,251.18. She challenged the trial judge's instruction to deduct sick leave benefits which were used in consequence of her injuries from the past loss of earnings component. Application dismissed; in an inflation-free economy the award for damages to replace the lost stream of income cannot be calculated simply by totalling the sum of periodic payments. The judge restricted the testimony of the expert on the basis that it might confuse the jury as to the state of the evidence. There is no clear medical evidence that the plaintiff has diminished ability to earn income in the future, or that this might result in any loss of homemaking; there is uncontradicted evidence of a partial permanent physical disability which could have an effect on her ability to work, and there is no evidence of future loss of income capacity."

2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The lease between the landlord and the tenant contained an arbitration clause.

The arbitrator found the tenant liable in the sum of $318,252 for repairs and $59,130.34 for loss of rental opportunity. The landlord sought to quash the award. HELD: 1)The arbitrator was not limited to interpreting the clauses of the lease. He could deal with the issue of insurance coverage. He did not have jurisdiction to award damages. The principles of waiver and estoppel applied as against the tenant. 2)The arbitration clause under the lease was a limited arbitration clause which did not provide that all disputes between the parties were to be settled by arbitration, but only disputes with regard to clauses or provisions of the leases. There was no jurisdiction to resolve the claim such as this which arises from the Landowner/Tenant relationship itself and not the clauses and provisions of a lease. 3)The issues of responsibility for repairs, whether the loss was covered by insurance and whether notification or claim was required were issues within the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator.

c_1999canlii12484.txt,"In issue was whether the law firm was in a conflict of interest with respect to two matrimonial files and whether the firm could remain as counsel for the spouses. HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux. The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm. At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes. She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses. 2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case. There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening. Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her. The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet. The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter. The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.","This was an application for a determination as to whether the law firm of Olive, Waller, Zinkhan & Waller is in a position of conflict of interest with respect to the matrimonial files. HELD: The law firm was satisfied that all the screening measures, with the exception of the computer file segregation, occurred prior to the arrival of the applicant. There was no risk to the applicant's assistant, who was to have no contact with the files. The screening measures were necessary to ensure that no disclosure of confidential information would occur. The applicant had not had any conversations with anyone associated with the Olive Waller firm concerning the Magnes and L. matters, nor had she had any knowledge of those files.

e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with operating while his blood alcohol content exceeded.08 contrary to ss. 253(2) and 254(1(a) as of the Code. As counsel for the accused provided notice of his intention to raise certain Charter issues, the evidence of a third Crown witness was called on voir dire. His testimony is the only evidence left for the Court to consider in determining the Charter application. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: 1) Based on the totality of the above evidence, it was objectively reasonable for the officer to conclude that the accused was impaired. The Court found that the admission of the evidence in the face of a breach so created would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 2) The officer was subjectively believed that he had reasonable ground to arrest the accused for impaired driving and to make demand for breath samples. If the grounds fell short objectively, the accused displayed very significant symptoms of impairment and drove in fashion indicative of a marked departure from the norm. This is not a situation where there was nothing to substantiate the subjective belief held by the officer that the impaired driving was caused by alcohol. The arrest was unlawful, the search was unlawful and the rights of the accused were violated. 3) The Court would also favor the exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis as there was no breach of s. 8 or s. 9 of the Charter and the Court would be required to conduct a more thorough investigation."
4_1998canlii13643.txt,"The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the adjudicator's decision following a hearing pursuant to s. 62.1 and 62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. The grounds relied on by the appellant gave rise to the following issues: (1) Did the adjudicating adjudicator err in law by finding that the respondent's conduct had not frustrated or materially breached her employment contract; (2) Whether he exceeded his jurisdiction by holding that Cajon, as the appellant's employer, had an obligation to attempt to resolve a matter of work difficulties that prevented her from reporting to work; and (3) Whether the adjudication exceeded his jurisdictional jurisdiction in determining whether the respondent had an unreasonable duty to attempt such an attempt. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1) The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts, as hefound them. In addition, his findings of fact cannot be said to be patently unreasonable because there was some evidence upon which he could arrive at his conclusions. The appeal based on the submission that the adjudicated erred in law was dismissed. 2) On the issue of jurisdiction, the appeal was allowed on the basis that the decision was patently incorrect. 3) The Court was unable to agree on whether the standard of review is patently wrong or patently unpatently unreasonable. 4) In an event such as this, where the law does not include patently erroneous principles, such an error of law may be fatal to an application of the standard. The adjudicating judge applied the standard set out in The Golden Rule (the standard of care which is applicable in all situations) to the issues and the facts were not so different from those attributed to them in judicial review."
6_2002nsca46.txt,"The plaintiff appealed an interlocutory decision in which the chambers judge held that a non-party medical doctor who had provided emergency treatment to the plaintiff did not have to answer certain interrogatories on the basis that they required an opinion. The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial. Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given. Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided. However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided. Interrogatories cannot be used to usurp the Rules surrounding the use of expert evidence.","The appellant commenced an action against the respondent physician alleging negligence in the performance of a circumcision. The respondent also commenced a claim against the appellant urologist, who performed a circumcision on him three days after the circumcision. At issue was whether the opinions sought by the appellant be appointed a court expert and required to answer all questions put to him in both sets of interrogatories; if so, should the appellant doctor be required to re-answer the questions submitted in this case with the directive that he answer them fully and in language that is capable of being understood by a layman; and whether the appellant was capable of providing expert opinion. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was allowed in part.  1)The appellant was correct in stating that CPR 19 does not state that a non-party witness can object to answering an interrogatory on the basis it calls for an opinion. In fact, it is not sufficient for the appellant to have objected to answer the balance of the interrogatories by simply stating they require an opinion, because the distinction between fact and opinion may not be clear. To allow interrogatories to be used to usurp this function without the presence of such safeguards for the parties, the experts and the court, would not be in accordance with the orderly and fair trial practice and procedure that the Civil Procedure Rules promote.  2)It was not sufficient to object to the question of whether the respondent doctor should answer all interrogatories that require his opinion, simply because he was a subsequently treating physician, even though he may possess an expertise in the area of treatment. Dr. Miller has provided the appellant with a complete copy of his file and has answered several interrogatories concerning the medical services he provided to the appellant. The appellant declined to act as an expert witness.  3)While recognize medical terminology may be involved in answering these questions, in answering them should attempt to use language that can be understood by the respondent, his counsel and the Court. In performing the circumcision on the appellant, the appellant is entitled to these questions. In the event that the appellant asks further interrogatories or requests discovery of the appellant he will pay the appellant's reasonable hourly rate."
2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The accused were convicted of using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. The accused appealed their conviction on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law in holding that the appellants as Metis, within the meaning of s. 7 of the Constitution Act, 1930, did not have an Aboriginal right to hunt at night with searchlight. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate aboriginal peoples' right (s. 8.1) to hunt for food and, if not, prima facie infringement. The trial judge did not go on to consider infringement and justification pursuant to Sparrow. The issue on this appeal was whether the accused Metis were subject to any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. 2)The evidence did not show that night hunting with artificial lights was so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right. The Sparrow test was not applied to this case. The focus has shifted to the limiting legislation in both Aboriginal and Treaty hunting rights cases. The issues are whether the legislation has an avalid objective and if so, whether it has a strong safety purpose. 3)It was not necessary to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. In deciding whether s.11.1 (3) is valid legislation, it is necessary to apply the test established by Sparrow and expanded in the subsequent authorities. The court found that the objectives of the regulations, both from the words used in the legislation and the evidence introduced, do not affect the Aboriginal right. 4)The objective was primarally safety. Safety was not the only factor. Safety is not the corollary test. The test was used to determine whether the right was infringed. 5)Costs were not involved. 6)The appellants were not entitled to unreasonable search and kill. The evidence was conclusive that the accused enjoyed aboriginal hunting right in their home province. 7)The accused had not proven they preferred a night hunt with artificial light. 8)Although the accused may have been Metis under the Constitution, they enjoyed aboriginal rights independent of that agreement. 9)The applicant had not demonstrated that he or she was acting pursuant to an Aboriginal rights right. 10)The appeal was also dismissed on the ground of insufficient evidence. 11)The appellant had failed to show any error in law by applying the Sparrow test to the facts."

2_2008nssm4.txt,"The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined. The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","The applicant landlord sought compensation for a breach of her statutory condition to provide premises suitable for habitation. The applicant's home was damp and riddled with mould, with the result that some of her belongings were ruined. A bylaw enforcement officer visited the premises and found that the landlords had allowed mould to develop in the basement, without proper ventilation, and failed to rectify the problem. She also produced evidence of medical letters to the effect that her children suffered from asthma and ought not to be exposed to mould. The mother of two children testified that she was affected by the mould. Photographs of the mouldy conditions were placed in evidence. She testified that the Landlord was totally unresponsive to her complaints throughout. The Landlord's eventual response was notice to vacate, which the applicant moved out with. The bylaw inspector testified that he detected mould and the conditions allowed the mould to start. Photograph of mould in her basement were placed on evidence. The condition was clearly described by the landlords tenant. The father of four children testified at length about what she regarded as the poor condition of the premises left by the tenant, none of which had any bearing on the alleged mould issue. She wondered why if there was mould that only affected the Tenant's furniture and area rug and was not obvious on the other carpeting. This was a legitimate question which was not really answerable at this time. The two versions of the facts were as far apart as they could be. The Director's report was unreliable and he could not have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint. There was also the issue of jurisdictional damage, which could be discounted because the original evidence was discounted."
9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","The survivings spouse received an income replacement benefit for herself and for her two children pursuant to the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. She took issue with the calculation of the death benefit, which was based on the percentage of her deceased husband's net income rather than on his gross income. SGI appealed the decision of the Queen's Bench as provided by the Act. HELD: The application was dismissed with interest not paid. 1)It is unnecessary to refer to s. 136(1) of the Act to calculate the death benefits payable to the surviving spouse for dependent children. The method of calculating as defined by the Regulations simply clarifies that the income is based upon the actual earnings of the deceased. The definition suggested by SGI is the same as that in s. 146(1). 2)SGI has calculated the payment based on a percentage of my husband's gross income rather then on his net income. She argues that she has received benefit less than the Act contemplates. 3)The interpretation suggested by the SGI was appropriate when calculating the benefit for the dependent children as well.  4)The fact that the deceased's gross yearly employment income was $51,343 was calculated when the actual net income was determined (as opposed to the $50,343 for students who were unable to earn an income) and GYEI was the amount deducted at source for income tax, Canada Pension Plan and unemployment insurance premiums showed an increase in her income. The SGI decision was not the same one as in the previous decision."
8_2000skqb570.txt,"The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender of four made in response to the defendant's invitation to tender on a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The tender package contained the usual privilege clause which stated the lowest tender need not be accepted. It is an implied term of the contract that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenders fairly and will not give any an unfair advantage.  2)The plaintiff had no experience in the type of pesticide spraying. It was not known at the time that the plaintiff made arrangements to hire an experienced subcontractor. The consultant hired to advise the defendant on the technical aspects of the project used reliable independent sources for his information about the operational viability of the planes. He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.  3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","The defendant Government of Saskatchewan tendered a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. Four companies submitted tenders in response to the defendant's invitation to tender. The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender, which was awarded to another tenderer who had previous experience in the area and whose planes received favourable reports. The Plaintiff complained the defendant had not treated it fairly in awarding the contract to Nielsen Ashdown. The defendant sued for damages. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)An implied term of the contract is that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenderers fairly and not give any of them an unfair advantage over the others. 2)Curniski conducted his investigation in a fair and impartial manner and in accordance with common industry practice. 3)The plaintiff compensated for its lack of experience by making arrangements to bring on board an experienced sub-contractor, a fact Stanley did not know at the time he made his recommendation. A number of the defendants, including Defence Construction, were involved in similar spraying programs in subsequent years. 4)The court reviewed the history of the tenderers on the project and found that the plaintiff had compensated by bringing on board the experienced operator who had unfavourable planes, regardless of the fact it was the lowest tenderer. It could not say the plaintiff would have completed the project if it had been awarded the contract, but the court did say the plaintiffs compensated by making arrangement with the experienced sub contractor. The defendants could have taken a chance on an inexperienced operator but for the most part they relied heavily on the advice of Gregory CurniskI, a consultant who was advising the defendant on the plane. The court found that Curniki used reliable independent sources for his information in order to obtain the lowest bid for the project.  5)Costs were not disallowed. Costs were set aside for the plaintiff to appeal the decision."
d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. HELD: The order was granted. The children were to be returned to the father by the end of 2008 with a condition that they remain in the mother's care and that they not be exposed to drug use or domestic violence. The father would continue living with the mother and take anger management courses. The evidence showed that the father had 16 previous youth offences as youth. As the father was on methadone, the issues he was facing were a consequence of the abuse he had suffered as a result of the father's drug use and the fact that he had been unable to control his anger. The mother was to work with the Ministry on anger management and parenting issues and the father would have access to addiction counselling."
6_2014skpc40.txt,"Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","The accused is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance. The Crown now applies for third recognizances. The issue is whether the recognizANCE should be granted again. HELD: The accused was granted one recognizant. 1) The accused has 59 prior criminal convictions, including 12 assault related convictions. He is now assessed as high risk to re-offend sexually and required to complete high intensity sex offender programming. 2) The Court found that an objective person armed with the same knowledge would agree that the fears of Corporal Teniuk, and indeed Ms. Woytiuk, that the accused will commit either a serious personal injury offence or sexual assault of someone under the age of 16 years and that their fears are reasonable. They both have the required subjective and objective fear and apprehension that he will commit a serious violent or sexual offence. These fears are serious and imminent. The accused's security risks can either be downgraded or upgraded based upon their actions or lack thereof while in prison."
c_2002skca122.txt,Appeals of sentence and conviction on the grounds the transcripts of court proceedings were not available; the court would not subpoena certain witnesses on his behalf; his state of mind when he made the telephone calls exonerated him. HELD: The appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed. The judge made no error in ruling that all of the evidence from the prospective witnesses and transcripts was irrelevant as being unrelated to the charges and too remote in time. The appellant's state of mind was adequately established by his own evidence and the summation to the jury. The defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it.

All of the members of the Court read your notice of appeal, the relevant portions of the transcript of the trial proceedings, and the Crown factum prior to hearing your arguments. They unanimously agreed that the sentence should be dismissed. The appeal against the conviction was that all of the evidence to be derived from these sources was irrelevant to the charges against you, being too remote in time, being unrelated to the charge which were the subject matter of trial, and being unnecessary to establish your state of mind which was adequately established by your own evidence and your summation to the jury."
9_1996canlii6809.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff brought an action against five defendants claiming fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a skin rash were the result of silicone implants. One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning Canada Inc. (Dow Chemical). In 1990, she received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. In 1992, she had the breast implants removed. In 1997, she underwent breast implant surgery, which was of course by Dow Chemical. In 1998, the plaintiff received replacement breasts, bearing a trade name, Surgiantk, also manufactured by the defendant, but these were manufactured in the USA and were not of merchantable quality. In 1999, the defendant applied to assume jurisdiction in Saskatchewan under Queen's Bench Rule 31(1)(f) and following the example set out in Morancase, applied to the Court.

The trustee calculated surplus income at $435 per month and recommended a conditional order of discharge requiring the payment of $7,800. Revenue Canada objected, requesting a conditional order for monthly payments of $750 over 4 years. HELD: Conditional order of discharge granted. The court found that the bankrupt was 43 years old, in good health and with no dependents. The bankrupt was also a self-employed contractor with an 'enviable' income. Following a review of the bankrupt's financial material on file, the court ordered the bankrupt to pay $500 per month for 3 years, to make regular installment payments on his self-employment income and comply with tax filing requirements.","This was a discharge application for another bankrupt who was self employed and through indifference, disregard and neglect did not pay his taxes. The sole unsecured creditor was Revenue Canada with a proved claim of $89,000 for unpaid income tax and unremitted G.S.T. It should come as no surprise that Revenue Canada was also the major creditor in the first bankruptcy. An order requiring the bankrupt to pay $18,000 to the trustee for distribution by monthly instalments of $500 indicated that he could accommodate a payment of $5,000 without jeopardizing his ability to pay toward his current tax obligations.

The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages. The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. There was no genuine issue requiring a trial. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them.

The claim seeks damages against the defendants, Loblaws, and the defendants. In issue was whether the defendants had misled consumers. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1) The Court held that it was appropriate to hear a summary judgment application prior to certification. There was no evidence that the plaintiffs were misled about the sodium content of the drink they purchased, nor did they rely upon the low sodium label when making the purchase and find they did not suffer any damages. 2) It is the common law practice to list products that are lower in sodium than other products but denigrating them as having less sodium content. The misleading and deceptive advertising of 'Low Sodium' beverages by the defendants was common. The Court granted counsel for the plaintiffs 14 days to provide evidence that my understanding is not correct. received nothing. 3) The defendants' reading of para. 16 is correct and proper admission was made (i.e. all the listed beverages have the Low Sodium label) and the plaintiffs' argument set out in their brief has no factual basis. 4) There is no genuine issue for trial as there is no evidence of misleading or deceptive advertising. The defendants have failed to show genuine ability to prove one or more factual elements to a legal cause of action. 5) The facts are undisputed. Consumers collectively would expect a difference in a 'low sodium' product from others in the line as being meanfully [sic] higher in sodium. The messaging is not that it is low, and so are other similar products, but that is meanfully lower. 6) The plaintiff has not specifically directed her mind in meaningful fashion to the claim, the Canadian statues or regulations or in short, the matters at hand. The conclusion that the defendants have simply misconstrued their own pleadings and seized upon what they believed was an admission that then emerged as the singular plank in their case. The case at hand, it is the one in hundred class action case where summary judgment is suitable. The issue is simple. It is misleading to label identical products differently. The only reason to label and market identical products is to create the illusion that the identical products are different. The consumer would expect difference in “low sodium” products from other products, which the defendants knew or should have known were no lower or appreciably lower.

The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.","The plaintiffs sued the defendant corporation for the return of a substantial amount of money. The defendant corporation was in the business of building decks and sunrooms and had been for 18 years. The plaintiff wanted to construct a glass sunroom on the back of their home and had obtained a detailed quotation for $3,604.53 from the defendant company. After the purchase of the property, the plaintiff found that the defendant had abandoned the project and was required to pay the sum of $96.25 to the plaintiff, which represented the amount owed by the plaintiff. As the contract was in dispute, the defendant filed a dispute note and became a defendant in the counterclaim against the plaintiff for recovery of the amount of $3.604.13. The plaintiffs counterclaimed on the balance of probabilities of a misappropriation of profits and lost profits. In his counterclaim, the Defendant argued that the costs of the breach were in a 65/35 ratio and that the corporation could have mitigated its losses by using more parts salvaged from the failed Ens project. The Court awarded judgment in favour of the plaintiff in this case, taking into account the fact that the plaintiff was a construction company and the defendant was a contractor. The court found that both parties were on an equal plane when it came to construction of the glass sunrooms but the defendant relied on the contractors experience to some degree to ensure that the project could be completed in a radically different manner."

The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial. The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. The trial judge further commented that, had the Act been constitutional, he would have convicted because he did not accept the accused's defence of due diligence. The Crown appealed, and the accused cross-appealed. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial, that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction. It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act. The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires. The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence. The question is not, as the trial judge thought, whether the employee who sold the tobacco was duly diligent, but whether the accused, her employer, exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent the commission of the offence, and by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system.","The appellant was acquitted on a charge that it sold tobacco or a tobacco product to a person under the age of 19 years contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act. The issues at trial involved the constitutionality of the Act and the defence of due diligence.

The police had stopped the respondent when they observed the passenger putting on a seat belt. When the respondent went to the police cruiser, the police observed signs of impairment. The summary conviction appeal court held the stop was random and constituted an arbitrary detention infringing the respondent's s.9 Charter rights. The Crown appealed. Allowing the appeal and restoring the conviction. Random stops are arbitrary detentions infringing the Charters. 9 but are saved by s.1. They are authorized in Nova Scotia under Motor Vehicle Act provisions. In the course of checking licences, registration, insurance policy and mechanical condition police are justified in making observations to detect drinking drivers; the right to counsel under s. 10(b) is suspended during this period.","The respondent was convicted of driving with an illegal blood alcohol level. He appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court on the basis that he was arbitrarily detained contrary to s. 9 of the Charter. The Crown appealed on the ground that the summary conviction appeal court erred respecting arbitrary detention and the exclusion of evidence of the breathalyzer test. Issues The respondent had been randomly stopped by police officer in a bar. The stop was conducted in order to check licences, insurance, and, although not mandatory, a breath test. It is an offence under the Motor Vehicle Act for the passenger not to have been wearing a seat belt. The police officer asked the appellant to accompany her back to the police cruiser. The appellant refused and the officer told the respondent that he would be charged with failing to provide a breath sample. The officer then told the appellant that he could not provide the breath sample and informed him of his right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. The trial judge did not give consideration to the potential application of section 9.Constitutional questions included whether s. 119 of the Highway Traffic Act could be answered without also examining s.9. The language of the Act was broad enough to authorize random stops of motorists by police officers. The wording of the section's use of the word 'forthwith' in the context of a roadside screening test clearly indicated that there was to be no opportunity granted to a driver to call a lawyer. The test was only to be performed immediately and to fail it had no penal consequences. The more accurate breath sample will correct the ALERT error."

The accused took no position. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. Making an order for video-conferencing for non- participating persons was not permitted because the Court had no control over the policing of the courtroom in Ontario. It would set a dangerous precedent that could result in multiple applications being made in future trials by numerous interested parties in different jurisdictions over which the Court had no control.","The applicant Government of Saskatchewan has brought a motion before myself as trial judge for an order permitting a live audio/video broadcast of the trial set to proceed in April 2013 from a Court of Queen's Bench courtroom in Saskatoon to a courtroom in a court house in the Greater Toronto area, Ontario. HELD: The application is dismissed. The court is not prepared to accept the argument that a courtroom that only the members of the family would be allowed in will be an extension of the courtroom inatoon. It is a distinct courtroom in another province over which this Court has no jurisdiction or control.

9_2011skpc15.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window and with aggravated assault. The major issue for determination was whether the accused can be convicted of the charge of aggravated assault or whether she should be sentenced to one of the lesser and included offences. HELD: The accused was convicted of mischief. The court found that the mens rea required for common assault is identical. All that is required is an intent to wound or maim or disfigure. The section pertains to an assault that has the consequences of wounding, maiming or disfiguring the victim. This is simply not believable. The accused is guilty of aggravated assaulted. The Court of Appeal concluded that the Crown has not proved the requisite intent to sustain convictions under s. 267 or s. 268 of the Criminal Code. The inescapable conclusion is that the accused struck the complainant in the facial area with the candle holder. The injuries were caused by a single backhanded blow."
b_2000skqb539.txt,"An application for a judicial review of a decision by the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Commission which held that the veering to the left by the two horses was within the tolerance of interference at the gate for two year olds. The Commission overturned the decision of the stewards and restored the horse declared to be in first place. In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed. The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence. The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual. 5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions. The decision of the Commission to refuse to give the applicants notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable. Their rights were affected by the decision. Bibeault was distinguishable. 6)The applicants were awarded costs.","The applicants were the owners of two horses involved in a $15,000stakes race that comprised the sixth race on that day's race card and featured a field of eight horses. The horses were moved up in the standings as a result of the result. The decision of the commission was patently unreasonable. The applicants applied for a judicial review. Application allowed; decision quashed; matter remitted back to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. The Commission's decision to refuse to give notice of the hearing was pathetically unreasonable. There is a general duty to act fairly on the part of public authority and this includes notice and the right to make representations to the tribunal. It is presumed in each case that procedural fairness applies and it will take an explicit or clearly implicit provision to the contrary in the legislation or the rules of horseracing, as in Bibeault, the employees were represented by an employees' association and therefore it would not be necessary for the employees to be separately represented. Furthermore, the decision of a commissioner to refuse the applicants' application is patently unrealistic."

He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The learned judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1) of the Code. The sentence imposed did not properly reflect the principle of deterrence or the gravity of the offence. 2) This was a serious fraud accomplished by what the judge called a rather intricate kiting system.","The accused was convicted, after trial, of fraud exceeding five thousand dollars.

For the appellant, that notice of a rental increase may be given at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease.","This was an appeal of a decision which set aside the decision of the Residential Tenancies Board and set aside any order based on the evidence.

The plaintiff alleged the contract price was in error and sought rectification of the contract. The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had. HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest. The plaintiff was entitled to interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act on the claim for extras to the contract. 4)The claim for the extras was never in dispute. The defendants were entitled to costs of the action.,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant whereby the plaintiff was to build and supply a ready to move home (""RTM"") placed on basement. The plaintiff alleged the contract price stipulated in the agreement was in error and commenced rectification of the contract. The defendant employee who had been commissioned salesman for the plaintiff for 15 years now admitted that he had given the plaintiff an idea of the cost of the project in May 1992, when he was aware that the price for the RTM did not come with a basement. He claimed the price was changed in June 1992 when the defendants approached him to inquire about having the plaintiff build an RTM. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for interest was dismissed. The defendants were entitled to costs of the discovery hearing. 1)The plaintiff was not given clear and convincing evidence that the defendants knew or ought to have known that an approximate price on an RTMs was $106,000.00 plus GST. The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% wasinserted into the document and I am not satisfied that there was an agreement reached by the parties to pay interest. 2)The defendant employee admitted that in the preparation of the June 1992 contract he provided an approximate quote of $100,000 to the plaintiff. This was not consistent with the information given by the defendant in its statement of defence. The real issue was the claim for rectification. 3)The defendants were aware of the fact that the plaintiff did not want a basement and therefore there was a mistake in the pricing of the RTMs. There must be a prior agreement which clearly shows the mistake. The error must be mutual in the absence of very exceptional circumstances which would amount to fraud or misrepresentation amounting to fraud."" 4)The court cannot accept the defendant'sversion of events. The plaintiffs claim interest at the rate of 5% or, in the alternative pre-judgment interest, is in error. 5)With respect to costs, while the plaintiff has obtained judgment for the extras, this was never in dispute and was admitted by the defendants in their statement of defense.

HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired. The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","HELD: The application was granted.

The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the information provided by the respondent on which to direct an assessment of legal services outside of the 30 day time period was not sufficient to require the assessment. As well, the respondent’s affidavit was not based on personal knowledge and the respondent did not provide the required information. The respondent”s evidence did not establish that the respondent had any complaint about the services rendered or of any overvaluing or undervaluing of the services provided. The length of time between the appointment of a bill and the assessment was not a significant issue.

8_1990canlii4256.txt,"Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.","The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. The complainant testified that she was home every Friday night with the appellant. She also claimed that he touched her breasts and inside her pants on numerous occasions. The Crown called a counsellor who was counsellora who testified that the girl was 11 years old at the time. The appellant's defence was complete denial of the alleged assaults. Two medical doctors testified, all of whom had been trained in counselling families and children, that the appellant had had sexual intercourse with the complainant numerous times. Over the time period covered by the information he was left in little doubt that opportunities could and did present themselves for the appellant to have had a relationship with the young girl. The question then was whether the admission of the hearsay evidence was an error so grave as to call for a quashing of the conviction. After considering the entire record, it did not appear that the evidence of an expert, in the nature of that given by Wollert as to the psychological and physical conditions that frequently arise as result of sexual abuse of child, was admissible."

The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail.

Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value. It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time it was made. Taking into account the factors before the sentencing judge, the sentence imposed could not be found to be clearly unreasonable.","The appellant, who stole his grandmother's car from her home and then drove to the Canada-U.S. border station, was arrested by border guards when he attempted to cross into the US at approximately 8:00 a.m. later that morning. The three friends who had taken the car also returned it to the owner without damage. The appellant argued that the sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the principle of rehabilitation. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's affidavit evidence was deficient in probative value and the respondent did not have a chance of success. The evidence presented by the respondent's father and the evidence before the Court was so inadequate that the sentence was clearly unreasonable."

The Agreement provided that neither would claim spousal support.HELD: 1)Credibility was determinative. The wife was articulate, intelligent and forthright while the husband was found to be evasive, argumentative and untruthful in answering a number of questions including the circumstances surrounding the signing of the agreement, the untrue statements he set out in his divorce petition in Ontario regarding his residency and in applying for default judgment when he knew the petitioner had served an Answer. 2)The agreement was rendered 'void' by the fact the parties cohabited for more than 90 days. 3)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The parties signed a separation agreement dated September 6, 1996. The agreement provided that the parties would live separately and that neither would claim spousal support from the other. The following clause appeared in the agreement:If the parties cohabited for more than 90 days with reconciliation as the primary purpose of the cohabitation, the provisions contained in the Agreement will become void. HELD: Counsel proceeded on the basis that the separation agreement was a separation document and that the agreements would not be affected by the events that occurred during his search for new jobs in the healthcare industry. The respondent was evasive, argumentative andultimately untruthful in his answers to a number of questions.  1) The circumstances surrounding the signing of the so-called separation agreement and the reason he gave forit;  2) The untrue statements he set out in his divorce petition in Ontario as to residency, statements that he swore as true in his subsequent application for divorce judgment;  and  3) His action in applying for a default judgment in the divorce proceedings when he knew the petitioner hadserved his solicitor with her Answer. The parties clearly intended to re-establish their life together. The fact that the petitioner swore that the two parties coed for ten days in May 1997 and in June 1997 was a ground for establishing a residence. The petitioner swore it extended for a period of 90 days. The Respondent disputed that evidence and insisted that the period of cohabitations extended from June 30 1997 until September 18.

The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act (the 'Family Maintenance Act'), 1997 which: (a) restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the petitioner; (b)restrains MLT from releasing/paying to any of the respondent's solicitors in relation to the respondent; and(c)restrorbs the respondent from disposing of any of his monies. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)The respondent argued that a restraining order granted pursuant to s.7 of the Family Maintenance act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that must be considered in an application for an interlocutory injunction. 2)When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably become a source of satisfying a claim under the Act, not only his dependants, but society as a whole has an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used first and foremost for such purpose. If the asset is not available for claim, then it is society who will inevitably assume the responsibility of a respondent who has previously not had the ability to adequately support their families. Perhaps this is why the court's primary focus under s.(1) is directed to determining whether in the circumstances before it, a disposition or wasting of the specified asset would impair or defeat a claim. Where there is any risk that a claim may be impaired or defeated, whether or not an intention to do so has been evidenced, the court has the discretion to issue a restraining. 3)The petitioner's claim for damages in the Action was the only asset that might give him an ability to satisfy the claim under s55 of the Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, 1997. Likewise, the ex partee order was lifted as against the Attorney general of Canada."
2_2004nssf92.txt,"The husband applied to have the wife's application for retroactive child support to cover the costs of the child's post-secondary education struck as a matter more properly addressed as an issue of contract. In addition to the child support ordered in the Corollary Relief Judgment, the husband had signed a document in which he agreed to repay the costs of the daughter's American student loans (which had to be obtained in the wife's name as the wife was an American). The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation. Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'. There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties.","The wife brought an application pursuant to Rule 14.25 to strike out the husband's application for a retroactive child support order. She sought a variation in relation to spousal support and a Retroactive Child Support Order, both designed to cover past educational costs. The husband opposed the application and sought consolidation so that one hearing could be held. The wife was unable to oppose the application. The applicant brought an amended application to strike the application for the same reasons: 1) the wife was not concerned about the form of relief as contemplated in the parties agreement and there was no evidence she declared it as income. 2) The husband was responsible for all of the student loans. He had no obligation to pay any of the outstanding debts. The only obligation he had was to pay the balance of the Federal Plus loans. The parties had made no agreement as to the amount of support they would receive in the event of a default. Both parties acknowledged the existing obligation and came to an agreement that the loans would be paid for by the applicant. The application to struck them all succeeded. The court reviewed the history of the loans and found that they were secured by the wife and her children and did not reflect the times in which they were employed. It was well established that variation, either retroactively or prospectively, requires material change in circumstances. In this case, the wife's application succeeded in declaratory relief and punitive damages were not argued in either written or oral submissions."
6_2015skqb138.txt,"Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","FIAT: The applicant has not made out a genuine issue for trial to prove the 2013 will in solemn form. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied that the applicant had not made an issue for a trial as they had not been provided with information as to the date of their marriage. The Court noted that the respondent had not shown any signs of mental capacity at the time of making his will. 2) The respondent did not appear to have any concerns about the mental capacity of his wife. The issues are whether the evidence presented is sufficient to meet the tests contemplated within the procedural framework. 3) The test in Quaintance is, as is the general statement of the issue to be determined in Dieno, based in the context of jurisprudence respecting the wishes of the testator. If a real issue is raised, the test must be tried. Where there are suspicious circumstances that cast a measure of doubt on one or more of these legal requirements, such circumstances will affect the ability of the propounder to rely on the presumption. Here, the presumption is spent and the will reassumes the legal burden of proving knowledge and approval. Both of these issues must be proved in accordance with the civil standard. The threshold for the challenge is reasonably low. The respondent's task of proving the legal requirements of the will was assisted by rebuttable presumption. The court noted that there was no evidence that the test in Ritchie gave rise to the idea of a mental capacity crisis."
2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of mandamus to compel the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was disabled and had been recipient of income assistance from the Department of Community Services since 2006. His assistance was terminated in May 2006 due to failure to disclose requested information. He re-applied for income assistance in May 2007. His application was again denied based on failure to provide requested information and he appealed the decision of the Appeal Board in September 2007. The Board ordered that his assistance be effective the date that he was assessed. After a series of correspondence, the Department was provided further information. Ultimately the department was provided more information and the application was reinstated. The Applicant was awarded costs in the amount of $750.00 exclusive of disbursements. The application was granted for an order pursuant to s. 14 of the Assistance Appeal Regulations. The court found that there was a clear legal right established to have the decisionof the Appeal board enforced. There was a duty to the applicant by the parties seeking to be coerced to do the act requested and the duty owed must not be discretionary in nature but may be established either at common law or statute. The Court found that mandamus was available in circumstances similar to that present in this application. The respondent was bound by the Act and had no discretion to make its decision in accordance with the regulations. The board acted in a fashion that permitted it to refuse to comply. The Act was required to be done retroactive to June 2007. While the Board's decision was not binding on both the applicant and the Minister, it did not bind the Department if it chose to request further information from the applicant."

The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial. The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access. The applicant had been prohibited in a 1998 order from removing the children from Saskatchewan without a court order, absent consent.HELD: 1)The issue of the payments was directed to trial and pre-trial conference to be held in January. 2)The mother was granted leave to move the children to Alberta.

The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings. HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings.

d_1991canlii4322.txt,"A complaint was lodged against the applicant police officer that she had been discourteous to the victim of a sexual assault and that she had lied about being granted permission to attend a meeting held to investigate the assault. The applicant was given written notice of the substance of both allegations according to the disciplinary procedure set out in the regulations made pursuant to the Police Act, but in the space provided for the citation the notice cited only the regulation which dealt with the offense of being discourteous. A hearing before an inspector of the Police Department resulted in the applicant being found guilty of the offense of lying. She initiated a review by the Police Review Board which concluded that the section reference in the charge did not have to be accurate. The applicant brought this proceeding for judicial review and submitted that the Board's jurisdiction was limited by the citation of a particular regulation and to finding her guilty of the behaviour described in the regulation cited. Dismissing the application, that the failure to cite what the Board considered the proper offense in no way materially affected the procedural fairness of the hearings or limited the Board's jurisdiction.

Allowing the application with costs, that there was sufficient notice of the hearing and the nature of the allegation to enable the officer to formulate a proper defence.

After two years, the relationship between the Respondents and the Mother broke down and she left their home. The Respondents sought and were granted custody of the child. The Mother appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Respondents had sufficient interest under s.6 of The Children's Law Act to seek custody of the child. 2)The trial judge correctly determined that the only issue was the child's best interests, even in a contest between a parent and a stranger, although the parent/child relationship was one factor to be considered. 3)The findings of the trial judge were strongly supported by the evidence, the law was correctly applied, and therefore his decision ought not be overturned. 4)The matter was returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access.","The appellant, who is mentally handicapped, appeals the entrusting of custody of her five year old son to the respondents. The child was born in 1989 and in the home of the appellant and her child were placed with the respondent and the child's mother (M.H.).

The relationship between the appellant's mother and the respondent's children broke down and she left the care of the respondents on May 30, 1992.

They are not looking for the appellant to pay but they believe the appellant was supported by third parties in a case which had no merit. The respondents, however, were not prepared to name any of the third parties other than the Department of Social Services and none of these third parties are parties to the action. There is little doubt the respondents have incurred significant financial burden. Given the comment of counsel for the respondent, he was not looking to the appellant for her to pay costs but that an award of costs may assist him in alleviating some of the financial burden, it is fair to award the respondents's costs on the Queen's Bench tariff on the trial below and on double Column on appeal. 2)The Court reviewed the evidence and found the respondents had sufficient interest within the meaning of s.6 of the Children's Law Act and therefore status, a decision with which it agrees the trial judge had to decide the issue of custody."
4_2009skqb403.txt,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","The applicant is 39 years old licensed practical nurse who is employed with the Mamawetan Health Region.

HELD: The application for interim relief is dismissed. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner in the interim should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem. The respondent has standing in loco parentis to the children. Although there was no opposition to the applicant's request, the deficit is arrived at after factoring in some expenses which perhaps are no longer being incurred, which may have been double counted or for which full consideration ought not to be given.

A very modest transfer is needed in the short term to relieve the majority from the economic hardship they are experiencing."
b_2000skqb106.txt,"SGI paid $47,427, the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, to the guardian of the three infant children of the deceased single mother. The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident. Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854. The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs. Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero. Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5).","The sole issue before the court was whether any additional dependant child care benefits were payable under s. 146(5) of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act when the deceased victim was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The children were not entitled to any additional benefits. The sole issue on appeal was whether these extra dependant benefits payable under the Act were payable in the amount of $47,427 being the minimum death benefit. The deceased was not employed and would not have become entitled to an income within six months if she had survived the accident. As there was no surviving spouse the children were entitled to death benefits payable as death benefit and income replacement benefit."

By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action. In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs. Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609.","FIAT. By fiat of December 5, 2002, Gerein C.J. authorized the initiation of a derivative action by Dale Henry on behalf of 609. The defendants in the action were entitled to examine a representative of the plaintiff 609 for discovery and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for the plaintiff. In September 2004, clarification of the earlier fiat was requested and, with the plaintiff's consent for the defendants and Mr. Agnew for the board of directors, the matter proceeded by conference call and written submissions. HELD: The plaintiff and the defendants who have status in this proceedings and not Henry in his personal capacity nor the board directors of 607 were ordered to pay costs.  1) As a corporation may only litigate with legal representation, Henry is empowered and obliged to appointed counsel for 609 (assuming for purposes of this discussion that Mr. Brehon, another member of his firm or someone from outside that firm is entirely matter for Henry). Whether that counsel is Mr. Henry 609 or someone else from outside the firm is an issue for Henry. Such counsel is entitled to access the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action, including preparation of a statement as to documents and following the modified discovery process set out in my earlier fiat.  2) Questions 3, 4 and 5 to be resolved on the basis of the existing rules of court and the applicable jurisprudence, it not having been yet demonstrated that this aspect of the proceedings warrant modification of the rules. The second branch of question and the first branch are self-evident once one accepts the unity of interest between Henry and 609 which is necessarily reflected in the decision authorizing the derivative action. It follows that relevant documents will need to be disclosed and any issue of privilege related to those documents dealt with in accordance with accepted principles. The issue of cost of production of documents at the examination by the Defendants include the right to request production of Documents in the possession or control of the 609 by way of undertakings at the Examination, and if so, who has the right of claim privilege on any such documents 609 through its appointed counsel or Henry through his counsel? These concerns still pertain and, without prejudice to renewal of the application for cost reimbursement when the concerns expressed by the Chief Justice can be allayed, the costs in first instance remain with Henry.  3) Questions 4, 5 and 6th branches of question are self‑evident.

d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant on May 3, 2005. The search warrant alleged that the accountant filed fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund, and misreported HST sales. An earlier Information had been considered for the purpose of obtaining a warrant. The applicant claimed the judge erred in concluding that the necessary grounds existed for the search. In light of his clear statement on cross-examination, the applicant said he would not have pursued a warrant without the information provided by the informant. He also claimed that the judge ought to have recused himself from considering the application to issue a warrant, having previously acted in a solicitor/client relationship with the spouse of the applicant. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) The informant did not say that he would have sought the warrant in the absence of the defective paragraphs but only that he was more comfortable omitting information that he now knows to be erroneous. The judge's own evidence supports the inference that he wouldn't have pursued the search without the paragraphs 20-23 in the Information. Unless real bias can be shown, such prior contact is not sufficient to raise the issue of bias. 2) The existence of fraud, non-disclosure, misleading evidence and new evidence are all relevant but rather than being prerequisite to review, their sole impact is to determine whether there continues to be any basis for the decision of the authorizing judge."

While the claim discloses a possible cause of action based on the Attorney General's statutory undertakings, this alone doesn't decide the matter. The amendments add nothing by way of necessary detail to the claim, which doesn't plead sufficient material facts to comply with the Rules on pleadings (see Rule 4.02).","The defendant AGC moved for summary judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that the plaintiff's amended statement of claim did not disclose a reasonable cause of action and was clearly unsustainable. The AGC brought a motion for dismissal of the proceeding on the basis that the defendant's claim was not based on a credible claim of loss of property but on fact that the warrant and restraint orders had been obtained by the AGC pursuant to s. 462.32 and s.63.32 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) There is no evidence that the undertaking gives rise to a claim other than by way of attack on the making or execution of the special warrant or restraint order. While it is a significant factor, it does not necessarily defend against this summary judgment application based on the pleaings. The amendments add nothing to the statement of Claim that was before Justice LeBlanc. 2) The AGc has not provided clear authority that the applicant's claim is wrong in law. The statement of claims must be struck in its entirety but without prejudice to the Plaintiff's right to file an amended Statement of Claim."

The Supreme Court upheld the decision. The appellants appealed.

A competitor, Datarite, operating through the appellant, acquired the claims of eighteen creditors and voted them over the objections of LaserWorks at a creditors meeting. Only two of the remaining sixteen creditors opposed the proposal. The respondent submits that the judge erred when she declined to address and reverse the registrar's finding that Datarita engaged in an improper purpose in acquiring and voting the claims, thereby preventing it from becoming a creditor. The court dismissed the appeal. The issue on appeal was whether the court's inherent supervisory jurisdiction should be invoked to interfere in proposal to creditors when it appears the statutory process is being used for purposes not contemplated by Parliament. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The court found that the Registrar did not fail to appreciate the evidence, nor did it err in arriving at its conclusion. 2)It was open to the court to substitute its discretion for that of the Registrar. Where the court is not satisfied that the court has jurisdiction to deal with improper conduct by third parties, the court was justified in using its discretion."

4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine at Rocanville, Saskatchewan. The plaintiff also claims damages for the defendants Sullivan Instrumentation Inc. (Sullivan) for breachof an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS. Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff and did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to profit margins, etc. of the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $500. The defendant was found not entitled to any more than nominal damages and the plaintiff is awarded costs against him. 1) The trial judge erred in fact in characterizing the plaintiff's actions as mere preparation. She competed with her employer for business which had been the employer's; her placing of the bid went beyond preparation. 2) The jurisprudence in this province establishes that competition with an employer will in almost all cases constitute a breach of the employees' duty of good faith and awarded damages to the employer. 3) The law is well settled that an employee is under an implied obligation not to compete with other employers during the term of his or her employment. Although Sullivan had given notice that he would no longer work for the plaintiff after September 30th he was still employed at the time he made his proposal. There is nothing that Restauronics can complain of in this case. 4) The court was unable to distinguish the actions of Sullivan and Sullivan in Restauronics."
8_2011skca35.txt,"The applicants applied for leave to appeal from a Chambers decision denying their application to dismiss the respondent's claim against them for want of prosecution. The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan. The building was substantially completed in 1970. In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building. In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss. In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief. In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer. The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997. Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held. In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant. Secondly, the issue of delays in litigation is important and the case will present an opportunity for the Court to clarify the legal framework pertaining to such matters.","The applicants are defendants in an action commenced by the Respondent University of Saskatchewan. They applied to have the University's claim against them dismissed for want of prosecution but were unsuccessful. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted. The court found that the delay from 1991 to 1998 (when the university's insurer was prosecuting the action) was not problematic. However, the reason for the delay was that the university had not obtained an appointment for the examination for discovery until 1997. As result, the university did not assume control of the action in issue here until 1998. The issue of merits was not the same as that in International Capital Corp. v. Schafer but the court was able to clarify the difference between the two cases. The appeal was of sufficient importance to the Court."
c_2013skpc37.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08. The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer. He did not receive a call back from his wife. The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available. The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid. After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call. The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape. The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio. The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action. There was no obligation on the part of the RCMP to provide the accused with a Prosper warning. The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer. The officer was justified in assuming that the accused was satisfied with the legal advice he had received. The Crown stayed the impaired driving count prior to the conclusion of the trial. The videotape evidence was not relevant to the .08 offence because all observations were made at roadside. The video would not have shown anything of relevance to the charge.

The accused blew a screening device and was taken to the RCMP detachment where samples were obtained with readings of 130 mgs and 120 mgs. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)The accused's rights to counsel were breached. 2)The destruction of video evidence breached the accused's right to make full answer and defence. 3)Since the accused had been allowed to call his wife from his cell phone in the police cruiser on the way to Carlyle, the investigating officers should have waited a reasonable time for her to call back. In this case, there was no interference with the accused’s right to counsel. 4)The evidence was clear from the accused that he made a conscious decision to consult with Legal Aid and, by implication, did not wish to pursue his first course of action.  5)There was no breach of the accuseds right of counsel."

The respondent seeks an order that his child support obligations for their child ended July 2004 because their child ceased to be a person within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from his mother's charge. HELD: 1) The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February. He returned to high school in the fall of 2004. He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother. Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media. He is still under his mother's charge. She provides him with room and board. He is only 19 years old.

It is appropriate to take an average of the last 3 years to determine his income.  3) Some attention must be paid to the financial ability of each parent to contribute. After deducting the table amount, the respondent would have a gross annual income of $19,781.52. On that basis the court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall for the child, to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts.

He was to pay child support in the amount of $250 per month, which would cease effective July 2004 and be fully reimbursed for any payments made subsequent to that date.

He died of drowning due to inexperienced scuba diving. Defendant not guilty of the offence charged; the defendant was not the deceased's employer. All four individuals thought of themselves as self-employed fishermen and had a profit-sharing agreement; the evidence did not establish that the defendant was acting as skipper or captain in the owner's absence; the defendant was not operating the vessel and the evidence did not show that the defendant had any kind of authority over the other fishers. The deceased was dependant on the boat's owner for the boat and part of the gear, for another individual for the licence and on the defendant for the balance of the gear; the relationship was closer to that of independent contractor than that of employer-employee.","The defendant was charged under s.13(1)(a) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act with failing to take reasonable precautions to ensure the health and safety of persons at a workplace. The deceased was a self-employed fisherman who thought that there were dead tuna fish in a tuna pen. He insisted on performing his dive, using diving equipment borrowed from the owner of the boat. Although the defendant was not present on the day of the accident, he was a member of the crew when the accident occurred. The Crown took the position that both the defendant and the plaintiff were employers for the purposes of the Act, but as the plaintiff was not in the workplace he was dependent on the defendant for the boat and part of the gear, on Coolen for the licence and on Murphy for the balance of gear. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty of the offence charged. The Court found that in the absence of a particular definition of 'employee' and 'employer', the 'general law' applied and under that law it must be held that the fishermen were engaged in a joint venture with the owners of the vessels, species of partnership, and that there was no employer-employee relationship for the purpose of the Health and safety Act.

c_2002skqb155.txt,"The wife sought distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property. The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm. The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt.","The petitioner sought a distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. The parties lived on an acreage and rented farm land. They carried on a mixed farming operation. The respondent did the farm work with the petitioner providing assistance. An appraisal of the farm land and out buildings was done and the report filed. Absent any evidence to the contrary, the respondent's testimony was accepted. HELD: 1) The farm machinery comprises major portion of the family property. Over the years the respondent has owned several machines and this began before the marriage. The petitioner has received no benefit from these expenses. For example, she received no income from the farm since the separation. Therefore, she should bear no responsibility for the payments made. 2) The debts submitted by the respondent which believe should be taken into account are these: a balance for $856,00, a debt of $1,000 for money she borrowed from a friend to make a payment on account of legal fees. 3) The respondent sold his trailer and the sale proceeds of $12,000 were used to purchase the acreage. There is no doubt about the fact that the respondent never paid the $16,500. However, the father personally testified that he owned the tractor. He acknowledged that he had given like tractor to another son, but denied making similar gift to the respondent. The father can hardly be heard to say he owes money for something he doesn't own or have an entitlement to. One doesn’t owe anything one doesn”t own or has an entitlement too. The Court reviewed the history of farm machinery and found that the oldest farm machinery was owned by the father. The oldest was purchased in 1990 and was in the possession of the petitioner. It was not clear from the dates of the appraisal that it was the father who owned the oldest but it was accepted as being owned by him. The two 80-11 Seed Rite of value of $800 are included. The same applies to a 30' Morris rod weeder of $225.

There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support. If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support.","The appellant applies for an order staying the execution of an interim order which provided ongoing spousal support for the appellant's wife, the respondent in the amount of $10,000 per month; gave her exclusive possession of the family home; provided for shared parenting of their son and awarded child support of $2,726 per month. The appellant appealed only portions of the interim order relating to spousals and exclusive possession. He has made all of the payments required by the order, except for the spousaling support arrears. The respondent has filed a garnishees to collect those arrings.

7_1990canlii4117.txt,"Where the petitioner demonstrated that she did not upgrade her education during the marriage as a result of her attempts to become pregnant and thus there was a causal connection between the petitioner's need and the marriage, interim maintenance in the amount of $100 per month was ordered ,  having regard to the means, needs and circumstances of each spouse.","The parties were married fifteen years. There were no children. The petitioner wished to upgrade herself so that she could obtain a degree in Accounting.

The respondent denied this claim, claiming that she was underpaid and that she should invest her proceeds from the marriage to upgrade her education. The trial judge awarded the petitioner $500 monthly maintenance. The court reviewed the means, needs, and circumstances of each spouse and found there was some causal relationship between the petitioner's attempts to become pregnant and the fact that she did not upgrade herself during the marriage. The parties agreed it was doubtful that she would be entitled to maintenance for any lengthy period of time. HELD: The petitioner was awarded the sum of $100 per month interim maintenance. On an interim basis, she would probably not be able to afford to replace her car. 1)The Court reviewed the economic circumstances of the parties and found they were at a disadvantage in that they lived together for a very long time. It was inappropriate to award the requested amount of $500 as a lump sum or monthly maintenance until the matter was resolved. 2)The petitioner was entitled to periodic maintenance."

The joint owners separated in 1999 and are involved in an acrimonious family law court action. The wife has exclusive possession of the property. The Credit Union as first mortgagee opposed the application. The co-owner did not participate. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)This is not the proper forum to attempt to affect a family property settlement. The husband was not entitled in these proceedings to a possession order. The wife prevented every attempt to show the property to prospective owners. There was no reason to assume she will be any more cooperative with a court appointed realtor. The Credit Union did not request immediate possession. 2)The court's entitlement to order a judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The court reviewed the history of the statutory authority for a judicial sale in a mortgage foreclosure proceedings. The 1852 Chancery Procedure Amendment Act was repealed in 1881 and replaced by Ordinance 51, Rule 1, which became law in the NWT by virtue of the Judicature Ordinance No.6 of 1893. It is now found in s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act in its modified form. Deciding whether it is 'necessary or expedient' within the meaning of s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act is, however, a judicial exercise.","After a decree nisi of foreclosure issued, but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners applied for judicial sale of the mortgaged property, being the matrimonial home. The relief sought was for an order that the property be listed with a private realtor for fixed time at an upset (listing) price of $120,000. The mortgagee, Border Credit Union, opposed the application and did not participate in the hearing. The defendant had no further interest in the property and was not served with the application. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court's entitlement to order judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The property had been listed for sale by the applicant in February 2002 and the listing agent believed it could be sold in four to six weeks for between $124,000 and $125,000 if shown to prospective buyers.

The Defendant Unions did not file any materials. HELD: Application allowed. On the whole of the evidence the court was satisfied that the applicant had raised a substantial question to be tried, had established a prima facie case, was in danger of suffering injury which could not adequately be compensated for by the award of damages in money, and that the balance of convenience in the matter favoured the applicant.","The applicant sought an interim injunction until trial or until further order on certain terms and conditions. HELD: The application was granted. The court found that it had not established a prima facie case of the violation by the defendants of a right or rights that the applicant might have. The applicant had shown more than the mere prospect or apprehension of injury that the defendants posed to the applicant. It showed that the defendant was coercing, threatening and intimidating the applicant's employees and/or other persons seeking to do business with the applicant and, in the process, intimidating and intimidating other employees and contractors.

HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent, resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was sentenced to nine months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The offence took place in Yorkton. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck, which was owned by the respondent and paid for through a loan from his parents. The trial judge found that 'basically all of the money' to pay for the truck came from the parents' bank account but they had registered no lien to protect their interests. The father was depressed and remorseful. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence was set aside and the truck was ordered forfeited. 1) It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The judge failed to consider the definition in the Act. Upon conviction, the first step he ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offsence- related property', within the meaning of the Act, by the use of the words'shall...order that the property be forfeited'. The Court may order forfeiture on the basis of the material filed and may hear any person who appears to have valid interest in the property. 2) There is no reference to proportionality in regard to personal property and it is only in regard of forfeiture of real property that the judge can take into account the impact of an order of forfeiture and whether it is proportionate to the nature and gravity of the offence, the circumstances surrounding the commission or the criminal record of the person charged or convicted. In this case, nothing turns on the failure to give notice as the parents were fully aware of the proceedings and their interests were dealt with by the sentencing judge, although he was wrong in his decision. This section allows innocent parties who have valid interests in the house to apply for a forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. The conviction is dismissed. The property is owned by a person who is a person charged with designated substance offences or has a previous criminal record. The respondent was nearly 22 years old and had no prior record. He is a first-time offender with no previous record. This is not a commercial operation. It is not that type of commercial operation, right? The truck was used to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The Court reviewed the facts and found there was no basis to grant forfeiture."
2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) upheld the appellant's claim for gradual onset stress. The appellant argued that the policy was wrong to exclude certain workplace events and stressors from an objective point of view. The appeal turned on one main issue: whether the policy should be applied to the decisions relating to the worker's gradual onset trauma claim. The issue was whether the Policy applied too restrictive a test. The respondent appealed. Appeal dismissed; WCAT did not err in not giving weight to the opinion of the Workers’ Compensation Board’s treating psychologist; nor was it wrong to rely on the respondent’ s. 4(1)(a)(i) policy in determining the nature of the workplace stressors. The only conclusion drawn was that there were no unusual and excessive stressors in the workplace. The policy set out the conditions under which each type of stress is compensable under GECA; the policy did not require an objective approach to the workplace; and, in the absence of such an approach, the Court could not find that the Policy was fundamentally restrictive."

When the defendant notified the plaintiff that it was going to cancel the policy, the plaintiff placed a second policy on the property. The fire occurred less than a day before the first policy was to be cancelled. The defendant refused to honour the policy. It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. Finding for the plaintiff, that the defendant has not satisfied the heavy burden of producing clear and satisfactory evidence that the plaintiff, through its employees, acted wilfully and knowingly to claim the benefit of coverage to which it was not entitled.","Decision in mortgage loss suit. The plaintiff had purchased two insurance policies for the purpose of indemnifying her against one insured company for non-payment of the insurance premium. The defendant failed to disclose the policy to the plaintiff and the insurer of the property. When the property was totally destroyed by fire in 1992, the plaintiff, who had been advised of the possible loss, refused to foreclose. She sought solicitor to act on her behalf. Awarding the plaintiff $200,000 for the loss of the other insurance policy, that under the terms of the arrangement the plaintiff should not be denied coverage on the basis of errors made by the insurer, the standard of proof was still on balance of probabilities but on a higher degree of probability, commensurate with the conduct alleged. The court accepted the plaintiff's submission that the insurance policies were in place for the protection of the plaintiff company and that they had been 'underwritten by and for the insured by' by the defendant."

d_2007nspc68.txt,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code, and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08. The accused denied having care or control of the vehicle. The only issue on appeal was whether or not the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in good care or Control of his motor vehicle at the relevant time. Care or control s. 258(1)(a) gives the Crown the benefit of a presumption of care and controlling where the accused is found occupying the driver's seat of vehicle 'unless the accused establishes that the defendant did not occupy that seat or position for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. There were no elements of risk to the public other than the possibility of the accused changing his mind."
4_2006skca76.txt,"The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","The appellant appealed an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. The father paid some maintenance for the child and had extensive access to the child, she spending most of the time with her maternal grandparents. He alleged that the mother was an alcoholic and as a result did not properly care for the children. The mother filed an affidavit denying all of the allegations, and in particular, that she was the alcoholic and that her alcoholism adversely affected the child. She also filed affidavits from three friends and a 16 year old daughter to support her own evidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed. Even assuming that the Investigation Record was admissible, given the direct denial under oath by the mother of either alcoholism or lack of proper care for her child, there should have been an order directing a trial of an issue rather than a decision made on the written evidence.

The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases.

b_2010skca58.txt,"The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident. He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.","The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.

He submitted that the trial judge erred in law in severing the count 4, the charge concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.

During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff. The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended. She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause. She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice. Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice, that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice. This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause.","This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal where the plaintiff contends that she was constructively dismissed without notice by her employer, the defendant. The issues were whether there was constructive dismissal, at what point did the plaintiff have notice of the changes which constituted constructive dismissal? HELD: The appropriate period of notice was 8 months. The plaintiff was awarded damages on the basis of eight months salary at the rate she was receiving at the time of her employment, plus vacation pay of 6% per annum and interest from July 14th to September 14th 1997. 1)It is not always easy to find employment in an area where there is an over abundance of qualified people who are willing to work at a modest rate as illustrated by the case of the plaintiff. 2)The plaintiff had not been properly advised of the proposed changes until she received the letter of June 1997. 3)The employer bore the responsibility of clearly informing the employee of proposed changes. This was done without delay. The employer bore no obligation to provide further notice. 4)No reasonable person would have thought that the four months of maternity leave given by the plaintiff prior to her employment as a receptionist was expendable time and effort. The fact that the plaintiff was not available for advice and assistance during her maternity leave did not suggest that she should have taken any more time off work. 5)Maternity leave was not intended as an opportunity for the employee to be seeking new employment.

6_2012skqb275.txt,"The parties agree that joint custody is appropriate, but the petitioner mother asked that the principal residence of the two boys be varied and awarded to her. The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well. The children have been primarily residing with the father. The father has been in three motor vehicle accidents within three years and is facing criminal charges as a result of the most recent one. The father works long hours as a maintenance man. The mother has four other children from previous relationships. The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home. The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education. One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines.","The parties met in 2000 and moved in together. The father had had primary residence by interim order but that arrangement was fraught with difficulty for reasons which could not be explored. The petitioner asks that the principal residence be varied and awarded to the respondent. HELD: 1) The respondent is 34 years of age and has four older children of other relationships. He is employed full-time, but has had to take on extra weekend work. The parties lived in a home rented from his mother. The respondent has been in law enforcement for the past four years. He took on extra-curricular activities such as helping with the renovations. He does not have the financial means to do these tasks. He has a history of poor hygiene and poor nutrition. He abdicated a significant chunk of his caregiving role to his mother and sisters. His unfortunate injuries in a motor vehicle accident in 2009 did not inspire him to adopt a spirit of compromise. The parenting arrangement he had previously abduced was flawed. He was prone to bad behaviour and had failed to meet his obligations under the agreement reached at the pre-trial conference. The court could not attribute the failure of the respondent to the petitioner. The evidence was that the respondent had not taken appropriate steps to ensure that the children would have access to the mother. 2) The petitioner is a party to the Divorce Act and the Children's Law Act. She is an experienced mediator. The Court could not find any errors in the law or the facts of the case. 3) The parties met at a settlement conference in October 2011 and the parties moved to live in a different community. They have three older children, two of whom are in the respondent's custody and one child who is in the petitioner's care. They live in an apartment complex. It is not an ideal situation for the children to transition easily between homes. This has not occurred and the respondent is seeking to have the boys' principal residence varied so that the boys can live with the respondent and the mother for the duration of their relationship. It would be appropriate for the parties to facilitate the continuity of stability in the relationship between the parties."

From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","HELD: The application was granted. The respondent was directed to pay child support based on an income of $150,000. The petitioner opposed the application to completely discontinue the child and spousal support obligation and further for all support arrears to be expunged. The court found the respondent had not proven that he could not earn consistent income. It was not clear why he had not been able to find employment in his chosen field or otherwise to continue to earn an income. There was nothing to explain what had changed except that the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made 10 years ago. The obligation does not lie on the petitioner to show why the imputed income is still appropriate. The only thing that could be said was that the petitioner had endured significant difficulties in the manufacture and sale of the respondent's invention over the years. HELD: 1) The original order was correct. The matter did not proceed beyond the interim stage. The task now is to determine whether the existing order ought to be varied retroactively to impute a different, albeit lower, income than that imputed in 2005. What is the respondent’s ongoing obligation to pay?  2) The court determined that the payor did have the ability to pay the arrear but there was little doubt it would be onerous for the respondent, who had attended post-secondary education, but then he had avoided paying anything for a considerable period of time. The arreears from 2013 to date will be adjusted to accord with the income as found. 3) The respondent had paid little towards either the court order or his obligation to provide support. He has been in arreary from the time the order was granted and enforcement steps have been pursued by the MEO. There is nothing to show that he has not paid anything for the past 10 years. The onus is on the respondent to establish why this time he has avoided providing meaningful financial support to his children and former spouse for the entire time the court ordered him to pay. 4) The Court found that there was no prejudice to the respondent because he was earning consistent income at the time of the application and had not caused any delay in paying child support in the past. The Court did not find any prejudice to him as he had been earning consistent incomes for the prior 10 years and, in that case, it was not necessary to vary the support order to an earlier date."
d_1997canlii11230.txt,"The contract for the construction of a spur rail line to the grain terminal provided that either party could refer any contract dispute to arbitration. The Arbitrator's award favoured the A &amp; E Rail Contractor's position. Leave to appeal had been granted. At issue was were whether the arbitrator applied the correct measure of damages and whether there was any evidence to support the findings of fact. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed. The respondent's application for enforcement of the award was granted without costs. 1)The issues were questions of fact not law. The errors complained of were the same questions referred to the arbitrator for determination. Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law. The wording on the second issue was changed slightly to read 'in his calculation as to damages awarded for increased costs of winter construction'. There was some evidence upon which the arbitrator could make a finding of fact. 2)As none of the bars set out in the Act applied the court was required by s50(3) to give judgment enforcing the award.  3)The application for costs on a solicitor and client basis was denied.

Dismissing the application, that the evidence sought to be admitted was either available at trial and was not adduced, was repetitious of evidence given at trial, or was evidence which could not be expected to affect the decision.","This was an appeal from an order of the Family Court dismissing the appellant's application to terminate a permanent custody order respecting her son who had been taken into care by the Children's Aid Society shortly after his birth. HELD: The application to adduce evidence on appeal was dismissed. The principles for the reception of fresh evidence were set out in R. v. Palmer (1979) and the Civil Procedure Rule 62.22. The procedure to be followed in dealing with an application to de-adduce fresh evidence should be as established as in the cases reviewed. The fresh evidence rule has been stated many times and is summed up in the principles set forth in R.'s classic case of 'the evidence must be relevant in the sense that it is reasonably capable of believe, and (4) It must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result.' In the case of the appellant, fresh evidence did not appear to have impacted the decision in the Court of Appeal."

The petitioner alleged they separated in 1990 when the father left the province to seek work elsewhere. He sent no money for two years until 1992 when he sent $3,200 and bought a washer and dryer. She commenced a divorce action in 1996 which was adjourned sine die by consent. The marriage was dissolved in June 1998. The respondent did not keep records of money sent as he did not consider they had separated until 1993. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1)Nothing turned on the actual date of separation which was difficult to determine. The mother was entitled to make a claim for support whenever she believed his contribution was inadequate, whether or not she perceived herself separated from him. 2)The primary purpose of a support order is not to compensate for past failure but to satisfy present need. Making a retroactive order would not address that purpose. She did not make a claim until 1996 and then did not prosecute her claim for another two years, at a time when neither she nor the children were dependent.","The mother sought retroactive child and spousal support. She claimed the husband did not pay sufficient support when both she and the children were dependent upon him. HELD: The application was dismissed.

Dismissing the appeal, that the respondent did not wilfully make any false statement, and answered all questions as required on the documents provided. Her silence in the face of uncertainty over her in-laws involvement in the fire did not constitute fraud. If the appellant expects an insured to comply with statutory conditions, it must reproduce them in the policy and provide a question on the proof of loss form to that effect.","This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's claim that the respondent conspired with her sister to have the seasonal dwelling owned by the four respondents intentionally burned. The appellant claimed payment of the sum of $20,000 plus expenses associated with investigating and adjusting the loss. The respondent's insurer appealed the decision. Appeal dismissed; in every case where a failure to disclose a statement of claim can be a wilful false statement, the insurer's duty to act in good faith has not been replaced by a statutory condition; and the statutory conditions which vitiate the insurance coverage, as set out in the insurance policy, did not constitute fraud or wilful fraud."
7_2010nssc146.txt,"The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","The accused successfully applied for an order excluding new evidence from her evidence during a pre-trial process. She had been prejudiced when the Crown made late disclosure of important evidence two days into trial. She claimed her right to make 'full answer and defence' was compromised, denying her a right to fundamental justice under s.8 of the Charter. She sought the exclusion of evidence or a mistrial. Application allowed; trial ordered. Although the Crown had made significant changes since the trial began, the disclosure was of significant importance to the accused's re-election and she had made strategic decisions to ensure that new evidence did not leak out until the end of the trial. This was an important time for the accused to re-examine her prior agreements and undertakings with the Crown regarding trial process and to ensure her credibility. The Crown had not disclosed any of the new evidence until just before her election. The accused had made these strategic decisions in light of the fact that she had not re-elected on a defence motion following the close of the Crown's case. She was clearly putting her knowledge in issue. The court criticized the trial judge for not offering the accused a right of re-elect but the accused took positive steps to place her knowledge and intent at issue. She agreed to have the video taped statement go in without contest. During that video, the accused raises an issue of willful blindness."
c_2002skca74.txt,"The appellant was unsuccessful in Queen's Bench in having his suspension and probation as a medical resident rescinded or to prohibit the Investigation Committee, which met on approximately seven occasions and interviewed seven witnesses, from taking further action. The Chambers judge refused to grant relief, finding the issues to be academic in nature and within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University, but ruled his supervisor should be removed from the Committee because of an apprehension of bias. The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure. He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. 1)The material did not meet the test for the admission of fresh evidence. It simply restated what was at issue and found to have had no effect. 2)There was no tenable basis for interfering. The remedies are discretionary. 3)The Court was not prepared to grant the relief in any event, given the long delay in seeking recourse. The initial concern was bias and jurisdiction. The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below. 4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations. Proceedings should not be allowed to be fragmented and should be allowed to run their course so the court has a complete record from the tribunals below. Certiorari should not be granted where there is a right of appeal, except in exceptional circumstances.","The medical resident appealed both his suspension and probation as a medical resident and to prohibit the Investigation Committee established to look into the matter from taking further action.

The remedies prayed for are discretionary by nature, the writs being writs of grace (see Harelkin v. University of Saskatchewan). Thus the appellant must show the Chambers judges abused his decision. No error of principal, nor any misapprehension of or disregard for any material fact has been demonstrated.

The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal. There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they hadcomplied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which are the subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant resisted the requested relief on the basis the plaintiffs did not validly exercise their right to first refusal. Specifically that they did not meet the requirements set out in the Act which require a letter of commitment from a recognized financial institution to finance the purchase of the land. The plaintiff counterclaimed against the defendant for rent it claims owing from the plaintiffs asover holding tenants. HELD: The application for relief was dismissed. 1) The defendant's offer to the plaintiffs was not conditional and unequivocal. 2) The plaintiff had committed themselves to the Farm Credit Corporation, who as it turned out was not prepared to provide such a letter, and they also incurred liabilities with Farm Credit Corp for loan processing fees and solicitor costs. Prior to the May 1, 1997 letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original contractual obligation to 'provide a' a letter to it from a recognised financial institution, and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs.

4_1994canlii4365.txt,"This was a petition for divorce with an application for settlement of corollary matters, especially custody and access. The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions. The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue. The mother sought sole custody with generous access. The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say. Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues. As the parties lacked flexibility, a detailed access plan was incorporated.","The parties separated in June 1992 and the petitioner voluntarily left the matrimonial home in November 1992. There has been a marriage breakdown and the divorce is granted. The parties have two children, a son born January 1989 and a daughter September 1988. The respondent seeks equal parental control and responsibility by an order for joint custody under s.16(4) of the Divorce Act. HELD: 1)The Matrimonial Property Act, s.186(2) and the Corollary Relief Act, ss.285(6) were satisfied. The present joint custody arrangement is not working on a day-to-day decision making basis. The children have had the benefit of one constant, outside the home, sitter, whom the parties have used for the past eight and half months. They are both caring, capable and equally acceptable parents who are involved and proud of their children. 2)The children need more than the tool or the guide that is being suggested by the respondent. Common sense tells us that parental cooperation and ability to communicate is central to its success. Joint custody is complex and there are many details of logistics, timing and notices to be discussed and worked out. It demands frequent contact and people who are flexible, accommodating, trusting and motivated to make it work. If the present communication impasse has not been overcome in the meantime, one of the parties will have to be given the responsibility of making final decision in these areas. They must be prepared to promote maximum contact between the parties to the best interests of the children."

The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg. He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence. Dismissing the action, that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way.

He went to the hospital emergency department, where he was treated by the treating physician, Dr. Janes, for treatment of a puncture wound. The medical records showed that the plaintiff had been impaled for about 25 minutes and then seen by the attending physician, the trauma surgeon, the nurse and the plaintiff's family doctor. The trauma surgeon testified that he thought the initial impalement was mild and not the cause of the pain. He also stated that he did not receive appropriate treatment for the subsequent period of time.

Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower. The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D&S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. It is alleged that the defendant failed to perform as agreed and in consequence the plaintiff seeks damages. The defendant resists the claim and by way of a counterclaim seeks judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The claim was dismissed with the result that the plaintiff was only entitled to $4,000 for extras he had ordered. Although he was intimately involved in the project, he was not required to pay for the whole of the extras. The plaintiff was awarded the sum of $5,000.00 as damages. 1)Cost of Performance was the prima facie measure of damages and the only one which could be considered as damages was the amount owing to the plaintiff who had purchased the property less than $1,000 earlier that day. Although there were several deficiencies, the defendant was not liable for the entire sum owing. 2)The plaintiff was responsible for most of the repairs and he was entitled to recover the sum owed to the defendant. He was awarded interest for the sum owing to deficiencies. 3)Although the defendant denied any knowledge of round pillars prior to June 1994, the plaintiff had been struck by two things which were part of the Phoenix house: the pillars and the roof. It does not seem likely that he would then speak with his contractor about only the one. Furthermore, the plaintiffs were obtaining advice from the plaintiff from time to time. It makes sense that he will speak with the plaintiff about both the pillar and roof before speaking with Mr. Wist.  4)The build up to the completion of the project was long and involved many changes. During the course of the work, the defendants discussed extras. It was agreed the plaintiff would pay for extras.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence. Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence. The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.  2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838). However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba).

The inference made by the trial judge was one that a properly instructed jury could have arrived at on the facts in the instant case and therefore should not be interfered with.

The application for variation does not relate to a final order but rather an interim one. Counsel for both parties acknowledged in argument that joint custody with an equal sharing of time should continue pending trial. As such, there is no need to vary the interim order. The real issue is where the child will attend kindergarten. As indicated above, this matter will be proceeding to trial within the next three to four months. Subject to the parties reaching a different agreement, there shall be an order that the child continue in kindergarten in North Battleford up to and including December 2004.

Do not anticipate any problems with her adjusting to change in schools in January and it will give her the opportunity to make friends in both communities."
d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The deceased made a will and codicil in November 1989 and December 11, 1989 respectively. Neither made any provision for the younger child. The sole beneficiary was the estate. The executors were directed to hold the farmlands and improvements in trust for the elder son until he attains the age of twenty-one years. The codictil directed the executors to rent the farm land with the deceased's brother having the first option to lease. There were gifts over to the mother in the event that the deceased dies before attaining the age at which age the children will be entitled to receive a quarter of a million dollars. The estate was substantially smaller, the children had a longer period of dependency and, whereas in Thauberger (supra) the interest income exceeded the level of support claimed, the Estate was not required to carry substantially all the burden of maintaining the children. The petitioner sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $150 per child to $1,245 per month for the two children. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to be paid out of the Estate. 1)The amount to be awarded for maintenance was not tied to the standard of living the children experienced during the testator's lifetime, or to the net income the estate would generate subsequently. The children required the monies sooner rather than later.  2)The deceased left an estate of $285,067.68. The purpose of the estate was to preserve farmlands in specie for conveyance to the children at twenty-two years of age.  3)The children were to have their own personal effects, other than motor vehicles, which were earning more in interest than the amount required to satisfy their reasonable needs. These effects of the Dependents' Relief Act had no bearing on the amount to which the estate could be awarded."

The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan. The Crown argued that it was not necessary for the Crown to prove anything with respect to commercial fishing in order to make out all the charges against their clients. HELD: The Crown's application was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge erred in law by failing to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and an abboriginal right for commercial purposes. Commercial fishing was not an issue in this case."

The offer was not accepted and the matter proceeded to trial. A week after the trial was concluded and while the decision was reserved, the offer was revoked. The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B. HELD: Queen's Bench Rule 184B calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer. The fact the offer was revoked does not alter the concept in Rule 184B and the resulting sanction. The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3 up to September 14, 2010 and double party of party costs under Column 3 thereafter, together with the costs for this application. All costs were payable forthwith.","The petitioner served the respondent with a formal offer of settlement on September 14, 2010. The offer was not accepted (and indeed never was accepted) and the case proceeded to trial. About a week after the conclusion of the trial, the petitioner revoked his offer. HELD: The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3. The court compared the offer to my decision with that of the respondent and found that the respondent was considerably more favorable to the petitioner than what the petitioner offered to settle for. The purpose of making formal offers to settle pursuant to the Queen's Bench Rules of Court is obvious. The issues that were litigated were substantial and merited a trial. However, nonetheless the fact remains that an offer to settle was tendered which was not found and the trial proceeded. Again all of this would have been avoided had the offer been accepted."
1990canlii4096.txt,"This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","The respondent applied for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel of the I.D.A. The applicant argued that the test in this case was not applicable and that the court should not interfere with the proceeding of a quasi-judicial body by interim injunction. Dismissing the application, that the trial judge erred in his decisions in McFetridge v. Nova Scotia (1981), 45 N.S.R. (2d) 319 and 86 A.P.R.(1), which found that the circumstances that the respondent was found to be in did not meet that test. This court was bound by the Appeal Division's decision in Ripley v. Ethicon Limited (1975) A.C. 396 and by the decision in McFerdridge, J. (1981) in which the judge imposed an injunction preventing the respondent from continuing with the proceedings against him. The respondent was given the opportunity to present oral evidence and attend the hearing but he was electing not to participate. The appellant's counsel argued that there was a serious question to be tried but the balance of convenience favored the respondent because he was likely to suffer irreparable harm if the injunction was not granted. He also argued that he would have had more difficulty making the same findings that Nathanson, J did in the application for interim injunction but would not have had the same difficulty."
4_2005nspc10.txt,"The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and cocaine for the purposes of trafficking, both under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession of property obtained by crime (s. 355(b)). The accused was a student the previous year and had been seen by several people on the wharf drinking beer. He said the accused handed him the cocaine which he placed in the vehicle console and in a knapsack with him, which the police later found at his feet in the front passenger seat. The police arrested the accused and found marijuana and cocaine in his knapsacks. The Crown called two other witnesses who testified that the accused had given them the cocaine and knapsock in the car console, which they placed at their feet in front of the accused's car, and a knappedack with a large amount of cash in it. HELD: The Crown adduced evidence from the police and the RCMP was that the cocaine was found in an open motor vehicle and was of a personal nature. The uncontroverted expert evidence was from the RCMP and the accused, based on his training and experience, that the amounts of both marijuana and marijuana and all of the circumstances establish that the possession was for the use of trafficking for the drug trafficking and so find. Possession of a weapon, drugs or cash found in the defendant's possession. The evidence established that the drugs and cash were for the 'trafficking' purpose and that, because they were in small denominations found at the same bag as large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, the only reasonable inference to be drawn was that these drugs and money were in the possession of the defendant. Although the police did not call evidence, they argued that this was a circumstantial case in which the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the only inference to draw was that they were proceeds of drug trafficking. Admitting the evidence: The evidence was admissible against the accused on the following grounds: 1) a person has anything physically in his possession; constructive possession, where he has it in the custody or control of another person (s4(3)(a)(i)) or where he is storing it in another place (s3(3)a)(ii); and joint possession, a case where two or more persons possess something together (s2).

e_2006skca55.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed. There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed. 1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission. 2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us. All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay.

With respect to the evidence of Ms. Brinkman, she does not swear that Ms. Bodkin was selling methamphetamine at the relevant time. 3) With respect to due diligence, it must be noted that the appellant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who represents him before this court. The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward. If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered.","The appellant appeals his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the Court accepting fresh evidence. The central issue at trial was whether the drugs found at the premises being rented by one s. Bodkin belonged to the appellant. The appellant did not follow the procedure outlined by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Lévesque in making this fresh evidence application. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed.  1) The Court's focus is on credibility. The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial. 2) There would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, which would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 3) The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief and it must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adducing at trial, be expected to have affected the result. 4) There was no evidence of habitation or habitation by the appellant in relation to the consumption of drugs. She did not know that the accused was living in her basement or that she was the seller of methamphetamine. The Court was aware that the appellant's actions, first, in asking the police officers to search her basement because of concern related to the violence started by her brother and then, subsequently, giving them full consent to search the portion occupied by the accused, are completely inconsistent with her being the owner of the methamphetamine which was found virtually in plain view. 5) There is no evidence that the respondent was a dealer or that he sold drugs but that he was the dealer. The respondent did not swear that she sold methamphetamine on April 17, 2003, the date when the offence was alleged to have been committed. The Crown's case is based, in large measure, on the evidence of a large drug user at the time of the alleged offence. It is pertinent to note that there is no new evidence as to whether the respondent ever lived in the basement."

b_2003nssf19.txt,"The Agency applied for the permanent care of four young children, aged 2 to 5 years. The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met.

The second child, O.D., was approximately 9 months old at that time. The third child (R.M.) was born approximately 15 months later. The Agency had no further information on this child's health other than to say that the child had head lice.

An assessment was held in January 2002 and the child was placed with the Agency and the mother was given access to both parents. Subsequent to that, the Agency conducted a psychological assessment of the child and found that she was prone to repetitive daily behavior and had significant emotional distress. The child had Asperger's syndrome and the symptoms of this condition were found to be present in the child when the parents visited her. The agency provided transport and materials to secure the child's diaper rash lotion and product and a general costing clause were included in the general costing of the assessment.

The wife had serious long-term mental illness and was unable to manage employment. The parties' teenage son was now solely in the husband's care. Spousal support reduced to $300 per month payable for a further three years at which point it will terminate. Notwithstanding the wife's disability, the husband's obligation to her should not extend beyond the length of their marriage; although the wife might not be able to become totally self-sufficient, there was no evidence that she was unable to contribute anything at all towards her own support.","The wife was in the military, earning between $51,000 and $60,000 a year. She was working and living with her father. The father was in support of his son, aged 16. The wife was now in receipt of income from her share of his pension, which was just over $58,000 at the time of the divorce.

They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision. The Crown did not seek costs.","The plaintiffs applied for certification under The Class Actions Act on behalf of the following classes: Veterans Resident Class Any Indian person who served in the Canadian Armed Forces (Criminal Law); Veterans Non-Resident Class; Dependent Resident Class; and Crown Dependent Residents. HELD: The action was dismissed as statute-barred.  1) The Court found that the plaintiffs had failed to adequately describe an identifiable class; that the claims of the class members raised common issues, whether or not the common issues predominated over other issues affecting individual members; that there was no bar to the bringing of these motions even at the pre-certification stage; and that there were no limitations on the number of opportunities to bring these motions. 2) There were a number of limitations issues, some of which were common and others that would be individual to the plaintiffs."
d_2005skca149.txt,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. His case went to Youth Justice Court for review under s. 103 of the YCJA. The Crown appealed the Youth Court judge's decision and argued that, on a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1) The proper Interpretation of Section 102(1) is that s. 102(2) includes the word 'apprehension' after the reference to s. 107. It is included in s.102(2). As the provincial director reviewed the matter in detail, he concluded that the sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. In consequence, she held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and community supervision order. 2) Section 107(1)(b) does not set out the broad principles of rehabilitation and reintegration. The only thing that can be said for certain is that the conditional supervision of a young person is suspended under the Youth Code. The fact that the youth is not deemed to be continuing to serve the youth sentence as a whole directly undercuts the objectives of the young person who is serving it."
2_2007skqb99.txt,"This judgment dealt with divorce and division of family property. At issue was the value of the matrimonial home and the balance of family property. HELD: Decree of divorce issued. Valuations of the family home and property were made, and exemptions and equitable considerations were addressed. Equalization payments were prescribed. As the results of the action were mixed, no costs were ordered.","The parties were in an action for custody, access, support, divorce and division of family property. Due to change in circumstances, it was necessary to sever of the matters of custody, custody and access and support. The sole issue was the issue of the valuation of the family home. HELD: 1) The matrimonial property or its value, both as defined in s. 2, be distributed equally, subject only to the exceptions, exemptions, and equitable considerations mentioned in the statute. The value for distribution is the balance of family land. 2) There is no preference for using the date of application as the starting point for determining the value of family assets. The Matrimonial Property Act does not require that the property be distributed as a whole. In this case, the respondent was not making any claim against the petitioner. Rather, the court will order the sale and distribution of proceeds from something less than the amount set out in the appraisal. The trial was held in November and December 2006. 3) The evidence was accepted as of the date the application was made. There was nothing in the evidence that would lead to conclusion that the date was to be preferred over the date."

The mother moved with the daughter to British Columbia in 1997. The parties did not agree upon ongoing access. HELD: The father's generous and far reaching requests were not reasonable at this time given his lengthy non-contact. It was important that he be reintroduced to his 10 year old daughter in a gradual and consistent fashion. He was granted access intitially for three and four hours in both provinces, then two days at the father's parent's home including overnight access and two days in the summer in British Columbia. Weekly telephone access was to continue each Sunday evening. Access was to be reviewed in the fall of 1998.","FIAT. The 10 year old lived with the father for a short period of time. In June 1989, the parents entered into a Custody and Maintenance Agreement. The father was granted access every second weekend, every second Christmas and Easter and two weeks in the summer all unsupervised. He argued that as the father was now living in British Columbia he could probably only exercise access rights two or three times per year and even at that he may not be able to afford to travel that many times. HELD: The child was to have access every four hours or so for two days in the months of March, April, June and July and periodic overnight access. 1)The father was to provide at least 30 days notice of which days he will be exercising his rights of access. The parents were to have weekly telephone access.  2)It was important that the father be reintroduced to his daughter in a gradual and consistent fashion."
e_1984canlii199.txt,"The Plaintiff contracted to provide market survey to the Defendant. Before its completion, the contract was replaced by second contract for Fund Development Officer. Each party had a different understanding of the duties of the Fund Development Officer which misunderstanding the Judge classified as a mutual mistake. The failure of performance by plaintiff entitled defendant to repudiate the contract. Defendant's counterclaim for rescission of first agreement, and repayment of monies paid under second agreement, failed where it accepted plaintiff's performance and paid consideration therefore.","This was an action brought by Fossil Fuel Development Ltd. against Tudex Petroleums Ltd. (Tudex) for breach of contract claiming damages. In its counterclaim, Fossil sought rescission of the contract and damages. The defendant argued that the agreement between the parties was breached when there was a failure of a performance by the respondent in an essential part of the Contract.

b_2012skqb443.txt,The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their children. The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.,"FIAT: The application at bar is another salvo in a bitter custody and access dispute. The respondent's counsel has put before the court another salve in the ongoing custody andaccess dispute. HELD: The respondent has ruled on the substantive aspect of the application in separate fiat and render my decision in respect of the admissibility of some of the evidence the respondent put before them. As settlement communications are almost always irrelevant to the issues that are properly considered by the Court, it is rare that there will be any competing policy or, indeed, any reason to reference them at all. The petitioner is entitled to costs of $500 in respect to the notice of objection payable within 15 days. 1) Settlement privilege aside, and with the exception of few issues such as costs and limitation periods or when a party seeks to establish a concluded agreement, am hard pressed to come up with a situation where the existence of a settlement proposal would be relevant to an issue before the Court. It is common sense that settlement is less likely if the parties do not engage in full and frank discussions; Few would initiate or participate in settlement negotiations at all if such could later be used to their detriment; and the respondent has demonstrated that he thinks that his proposal is reasonable so must be a good, reasonable parent; by failing to accept that reasonable proposal, she must be unreasonable and, therefore not as good parent. This is gamesmanship and nothing more. Gamesmanship fouls that which the policy seeks to promote. Relevance of settlement proposals: 1) The privilege is removed. The only thing that is relevant in this situation is the relevance of the respondent's proposal to the court. It should only be set aside if there is a very compelling, competing policy warranting such a waiver. It does not matter if the proposal is identical to the other. The proposal is irrelevant and irrelevant. It was made with the express or implied intention that it would not be disclosed to the Court unless both parties agree. Settlement negotiations are protected by settlement privilege which is a jointly held privilege that cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. This privilege is fundamental to the policy interest of promoting settlement discussions as a means to avoiding trial. It could only be waived with the consent of both parties. 2) The respondent thinks that nothing is irrelevant if the correspondence does not relate to the negotiations. The fact that he does not see that it is irrelevant at the moment does not serve to diminish the privilege. It merely puts the matter on the basis of normal contract negotiations."
b_2005nssf21.txt,"The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","The parties shared joint custody of the three children of the marriage. The primary care was to be with the mother. The parties did not seek periodic or lump sum support but rather a conditional order that the children's best interests were served by remaining in the matrimonial home with their father. The mother opposed the payment of spousal support in any form as she felt it would cause her financial future to be disrupted. She sought an order prohibiting the father from leaving the country with the children. The father opposed the application for a lump sum award as he argued the children would suffer economic hardship due to the breakdown of their marriage, especially since they did not have a means to obtain a mortgage on their rental property. He argued the family had always been a joint business operated for the benefit of the family and that they would not be able to afford the mortgage on the home. Awarding the mother $986 per month in basic guideline support, that there was no evidence she posed flight risk to the children, given the extensive family support system available in the province, and that the fact the children had always wanted to study divinity and the fact that the mother had been very supportive of their father during the marriage did not disqualify her from making this application. The court reviewed the relevant case law and found that it was impossible for a mother to deny her children the opportunity to become involved in many extracurricular activities. The principles of fundamental fairness were considered in Simmonds v. Simmonds (2001) and the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal adopted the approach set forth in Tolkeren (TWL) in dismissing the application."
8_2007skpc1.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The accused applies pursuant to The Charter of rights to the use of the Charter for relief under s. 71(d)(i) Morin. The length of delay is approximately thirty-one months. There was also a violation of her right to be tried for a charge of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the CDSA.  2) There was no evidence that any lack of institutional resources caused the delay. 3) The weather caused delay from November 29, 2006 to January 19, 2007.  4) The total delay is twelve months. The accused did not contribute to the remaining delay. There were some delays attributable to the accused in time until she was ready to enter pleas, and later until she could have the matter rescheduled for trial. Otherwise, she appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charges set. Actions of the accused include delaying service of a summons and obtaining an edited copy of the search warrant. 5) The court found there was no prejudice as a result of the assault and that the accused's employment opportunities were opened. The fact that she was able to work through the exclusion of any restrictions that prevented her from obtaining better employment opportunities, and that she had the opportunity to improve her employment situation by bringing these offences to trial, does not outweigh the actual prejudice to the public interest in having her tried for the charge."

The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of the defendant's cattle getting into the plaintiff's canola field in late July, 1999. The defendant admitted that his cattle were in the plaintiff’s crop on one occasion but said that there was no evidence they were in any other location during the time. The plaintiff also denied liability under s.27 of the Stray Animals Act. HELD: Judgment was granted in favour of the plaintiffs. The cattle owner was strictly liable for damage caused by his cattle. The court accepted the evidence of a professional witness who had examined the field extensively and who was entitled to assess dockage at the elevator. However, the court found that the expert was not prohibited from going throughout the field. The damage was minimal and the plaintiff was not disbarred."

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action. The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution.","The bankrupt applied for a conditional order of discharge under Queen's Bench Rule 319. He contended that s. 241 of the Income Tax Act prohibited the disclosure of this information. The bankrupt had been in bankruptcy for 28 months prior to this assignment. He had received notice that he was in bankruptcy on the basis of a failure of his former business, Red Bull Enterprises Ltd. The assignment occurred in December 1995 and the bankrupt was unable to meet financial obligations. Directors obligations, pressure of creditors and the sale of his common law spouse's company were all issues. He submitted that the facts under s. 173(1)(a) of the Act were so complex as to be impossible to prove. The applicant suggested that the bankrupt's affidavit evidence was based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge. HELD: A conditional order was granted requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750.00 from any source to the trustee. 1) The Court was not convinced that these proceedings were final in nature and dismissed the objection as being premature.  2) The applicant's evidence was accepted based upon reasonable doubt as to the circumstances of the assignment. 3) There was no evidence of the bankrupt putting them through unnecessary expenses by using taxpayer information to defend his action. The evidence would not have been of final nature in this case.  4) The bankrupt's argument was not convincing. He admitted that he had not paid tax on the money received from the vendors and that it was their own fault. The'my way or the door way' attitude was nothing more than bullying tactic used by the bankrupt. The claim of Revenue Canada was for $58,720.34.  5) The court was not satisfied that the principle and exemption contained in s.295(5)(a of the Excise Tax Act would allow disclosure of information relating to the history of payments of goods and services tax by Clearsky Enterprises Ltd.. 6) The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and service tax was questionable. It cannot be said that Parliament intended the disclosure provisions to stretch beyond what would be reasonable for enforcement of the ITA and Excise tax Act."

HELD: The application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for six months, and on the basis that there is no sale to be confirmed based on the evidence filed. The application is premature. There is limited evidence with respect to the value of the property and no evidence from the licensed realtor who was charged with the responsibility of listing the property as to the steps taken. The amount owing under the mortgage was described as being the arrears of principal, $29,994, and interest arrees of interest at $995.03 or a total of $30,990.01. The statement of claim was not noted for default prior to the application being made for the appointment for the hearing. The affidavit of Randy Schneider, the manager of the Mendham-Burstall Credit Union, was filed in support of the application. There was no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre- leave costs."
d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The defendant brought two separate notices of motion. The first was to compel the plaintiff to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant. The second motion requested that the plaintiff provide notice to the defendant that the defendants had failed to provide basic water services at various Holguin resorts. The plaintiff sought to have the defendant order the defendants to reveal the names of the nine property owners who have, to date, received the package. The defendant objected that the list was misleading and asked the plaintiff for leave to cross examine the plaintiff. HELD: The motion was dismissed. The Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when the relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications in some other lawful manner. Counsel for the defendant is to provide plaintiff with a list. 1) The wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of the Class Actions Act creates a concern about the suspension of time limitations. 2) It is important to keep in mind in reading cases from Ontario that neither the section dealing with the service of notice (section 19 of the Ontario Class Proceedings Act) nor the general provision allowing the Court to make any order considers appropriate (section 12 of the Act) are limited to actions that have already been certified. 3) The Court was not prepared to broaden the scope of the Court's decision to allow for examination of Ms. Moore on her affidavit. 4) In this case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potentially class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. That is not the situation here. The usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for plaintiff to demand defendant produce plaintiff information. The examination may lead to a multitude of issues such as production of documents and undertakings and so forth. However, from a practical point of view that could result in further motions arising out of this examination. 5) Based on the plain wording of the statement of claim (S. 14, s. 15 of the SCC Act) the limitation period is suspended both in the case of actions certified [s. 43 (2)] and in certain limited circumstances, in the Case of actions that are not certified. The issue here is whether the Court has jurisdiction to make orders prior to certification as a class action. The following is an example of an Ontario Court faced with less restrictive wording declined to allow pre-certification notices to be sent to all persons who travelled with the defendant during the purposed class proceedings.

d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. The parties were 60 years old and the respondent was 53. Both had health problems. The respondent was 60. She had had surgery followed up by radiation. She also had shingles and an attack in the nature of stroke in March 2006. The appellant suffers from Hepatitis C. The chambers judge imputed an income to the respondent of $14,289 based on the assumption she was capable of working 30 hours a week at minimum wage. He found the respondent's income to be $30,000. This was an error as it failed to take into account employment expenses of $8,822 allowed by the Canada Revenue Agency and expressly found by the chambers judge to be reasonable. The proper income for the appellant was still in the neighbourhood of $30k. He also had the same medical issues as the respondent. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order set aside was set aside. The court reviewed the facts and found that the respondent had not engaged in gainful employment at all during the year following the order of the judge. It was incumbent on the respondent on the review application to establish that she was unable to become self sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish this fact until just before the hearing of her application and prior to the filing of the notice of motion and the application to the hearing in the application and the order against the appellant for costs of the appeal."

The applicant, which leased six school buildings from the Roman Catholic Church, submitted the respondent was required to reimburse the applicant for leasing costs. For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs. Where the Minister received a request in the proper form and where it was determined leases were necessary, the leasing costs would be the respondent's responsibility.","The applicant school board sought a declaration that the Province was responsible to provide school buildings required for the delivery of a basic Public School Program. Included in the fifty-five schools are six school buildings leased by the Cape Breton Board from the Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Antigonish or other entities of the Roman Catholic Church. It is the responsibility for payment of the leasing cost on these buildings that is now before the Court. The issue is whether the Minister of Education (the 'Minister') is required to reimburse the board for the costs incurred by the board in leasing these buildings from the Church. The Court found that, because of the failure to follow the Education Act, the Province is not required to pay the cost of these leases."
7_1996canlii7107.txt,"The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600. The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amount of unpaid child support paid for his 2 daughters by one-half. An earlier corollary relief judgment was made in 1989 except that an order suspending enforcement of arrears during periods when the respondent was unemployed was granted. HELD: The application was dismissed. The father was ordered to file a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing income received from employment with the maintenance enforcement office commencing September 30, 1996 and every three month period until the arrear is paid in full. 1)The father was unemployed for several years. He started to fall behind in his child support obligations in 1993. He worked sporadically since that time. The mother was employed and while her income increased, her expenses increased correspondingly. Since the judgment, the employer closed and she was hired on jobs in accordance with the union hiring practices. 2)The mother was to pay child support of $300 per child per child during months when his gross monthly earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when hisgross monthly earnings were less than $2200. The arreary was reduced by $7,000 and when the father earned $2.200 per month or more he was topay $200.00 per month on arreari in addition to the on-going child support obligation.  3)Given the significant reduction in income experienced by the respondent since 1994, there has been an amaterial change in circumstances. Since his employment is uncertain in his trade a flexible order would be appropriate."
b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be reserved on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now shows that substantial offers were made through counsel, although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant argues that the Court needed to know the full extent of the estate so as to properly determine the applicant's entitlement to the estate. HELD: 1)The applicant was awarded costs in lump sum.  2)The respondent was ordered to pay $250,000 which was approximately half of the amount awarded.  3)The Executions Act provides that the costs of proceedings in the court are in the discretion of the court. Rule 343A contemplates amendment. The court's discretion to award costs arises out of its inherent equitable jurisdiction and out of Rule 542 of the Queen's Bench Rules in assessing appropriate costs. Rule 541 provides that costs of all proceedings in court are to be in the sole discretion of The Court. Rule 337A contemlights the jurisprudence is clear that an inherent power to vary its own order so as not to carry out what was intended or even to reconsider or withdraw the decision so long as the order has not been perfected. Rule 345A is the court of last resort in this regard. The re-hearing of this issue does not involve the merits of the case and was limited to the issue of costs. The respondent has been awaiting the outcome of this application."
7_1995canlii4030.txt,"After a series of pre-trial conferences, and the exchange of some correspondence between the parties lawyers, the husband took the position that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of his pension. The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order that determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the respondent's pension plan during negotiations during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with written reasons to follow. 1)The court reviewed the relevant case law and found that settlement should not be taken as an application to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. 2)The respondent's letter to the appellant constituted an agreement to settle the matrimonial property dispute. The fiat ended with the respondent giving his written consent to the settlement. 3)Allowing the appeal was that the courts in Zimmerman and in Childs were dealing with something entirely different: an agreement fixing the values of few items of property, reached during the course of negotiations with view to an overall property settlement between the parties. There was nothing in the evidence to indicate the parties intended that each individual item agreed to would constitute a separate, independent, binding and enforceable agreement irrespective of whether agreement was reached on all of the other items outstanding between them. Accordingly, there was no contract that the judge could enforce."

The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens.

The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent.

b_2008nspc5.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked when he was found operating an all terrain vehicle (ATV) on a highway. Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along the community's highway. His driver's license was revoked and he was charged with driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his licence was revoked. At trial, the Crown argued that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2) do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation was irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an ATIV on the road. The defence argued that since there was no nexus between his driving of the ATV (and the revocation of his driver's licence) and the revocation his driver’s license he should be guilty of the offence. The only issue at trial was whether this makes the accused guilty of driving a vehicle on a highway while he was revoked contrary to s.287(2). The accused was 41 years of age and had a Crown insurance policy on his vehicle. He was not required to operate a sidewalk ATV. The words “motor Vehicle” in s.(2) did not include the vehicle as they were not registered under the Motor Vehicle Act. Even if they did, he was still convicted of driving on the roadway while his license had been revoked. The accused should not have been charged with the offence of operating motor vehicle or for speeding because he could have been lawfully licensed to operate the ATVs on the roads. The Crown argued it was not that simple and held that the all-terrain vehicle must be excluded from the definition of motor vehicles in the Motor Vehicles Act. The Court held that it was obvious that the accused was driving an all terrain motor vehicle and the words ‘motorveh’ did, but even if they didn’t, the offence was still under the motor vehicle act since he was not registered as such. The Defence argued that because the accused had been observed by the police, they could not have prevented him from operating the ATv on the street because it was a prohibited vehicle and he could not be liable for any damages arising in the event of an accident. The court found that the defence was clearly not exempting ATVs from the definitions of motor vehicle in the Act and even if the words were included in all provisions of the Act, he should not be found guilty."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","The accused was convicted of dangerous driving and assault. The accused appealed his conviction on dangerous driving. The defence argued that the trial judge failed to give effect to implied consent and in adopting a zero tolerance approach. The offence was committed between spouses where minor incidental physical contact can be expected, and where minor motor vehicle activity is nothing more than de minimis non curat lex. The court found that the accused's driving was a marked departure from the standard of care expected of a reasonably prudent driver in similar circumstances. The trial judge also failed to take into account the fact the accused was following the complainant and pushed her towards the side of the road. The complainant suffered damage to her arm, arm and leg as result of the assault. On appeal the accused appeals the dangerous driving conviction. The appeal court judge must not substitute her own opinion for that of the trial court judge. The essence of the appeal is that the judge properly instructed herself on the law and that her findings of fact are supported by the evidence. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)The trial judge correctly identified the law in Saskatchewan and correctly identified it. The case law requires that the driving must be dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances including a residential street, a two way street, no other vehicles, pedestrians or children were present at the time of the incident and the accused drove parallel to the complainant. This was not an infrequently travelled country road. Since the complainant was not cross-examined at trial and her evidence went in unchallenged, the trial trial judge is entitled to considerable deference in her assessment of the evidence from that of that judge. 2)The accused conceded that the offence was an inherently dangerous activity, but one that necessarily includes the intentional application of force. The location of where the incident occurred elevates the dangerous nature of the appellant's actions. The fact he drove so close to the appellant that his driving could have presented danger for oncoming vehicles or pedestrians, and that he was forced off the road to avoid an accident. The Court's focus must be on the risks created by the accused’s manner of driving, not the consequences, such as an accident in which he was involved. 3)The Court reviewed the evidence and found nothing which suggested there was a miscarriage of justice. The standard of review is not whether the conclusion was correct or even if an appellate court would have interpreted the evidence differently. It is the standard imposed by the Court on a summary conviction."
e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. They attended a French language school (École de Bellegarde) for the children's benefit. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children’s provisional permission to attend would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children filed a complaint with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. The Court reviewed the relevant provisions of The Education Act and found that the CÉF had not complied with its commitments to the children. HELD: The Court held that the plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed as an abuse of process because the plaintiffs never applied for judicial review to set aside the appeal decision rendered by the elected directors of the school and their failure to encourage the children to learn in French.  1) The court found that s. 23 of the Charter gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to decide whether it will admit any non-right holders to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan. 2) The Court found that it was impossible for the Court to analyze the reasoning and facts of the law in light of the statements of claim made by the plaintiffs. 3) There was no evidence that the Court would be unable to find a satisfactory solution to the problems identified by the Court based on the evidence of the plaintiffs and their non-rights holder parents. 4) There were no reasonable and probable grounds to conclude that the discrimination against the plaintiffs was based entirely upon the failure of the parents to comply with their commitments. The court awarded special damages for out-of-pocket expenses, travel expenses, the cost of training and re-training of the service dog notwithstanding compensation that might otherwise be available to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 22.3(2) of the Animal Protection Act and general damages for the respondents’ loss of a right to access the school."

The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","Land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in 1997 and received the same in 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. The development officer declared the application incomplete and declared it to be in fact complete. The municipality appealed the certiorari decision. The developer sought an order quashing the development officer's decision that the application was incomplete, a declaration that it is in fact completed and an order of mandamus directing the development director to issue the final approval. Application set aside; although the municipality relied on s. 278 of the Municipal Government Act in its submission that the higher road standard represented a major obstacle, the requirement to meet the new road standards represented a minor obstacle for the applicant who was to be protected from any subsequent changes. The Applicant argued that s. 283 represents the legislator's effort to protect developers exactly like the Applicant who received tentative approval under one regime and are to be protect from any future changes. Land developer, however, sought an additional order of certioraris quashing or annulling the decision to declare it incomplete and a mandamus order directing the developer to issue final approval within two years of the date of the approval of the tentative plan. The Municipality relied upon subsections 278(1), (2)(f) and (g) which provide that an application for subdivision approval shall be approved if the proposed subdivision is in accordance with the enactments in effect at the time complete application is received. The second requirement appears to be inconsequential. The first requirement is the very subject matter of this hearing."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation was amalgamated with the defendant corporation and held itself out as an energy efficiency consultant. The defendant entered into a letter agreement whereby the defendant agreed to pay half of the plaintiff's energy savings, a sum which the plaintiff claimed was part of price reductions offered by its own suppliers of fuel. The plaintiff paid the defendant a deposit and service fee of Eight Thousand Dollars ($8,000). The defendant agreed that if the payment did not arrive by the next possible date, it would file a default judgment against the plaintiff. This was not a mistake or an oversight; the defendant knew that there would be judgment against him in British Columbia. The fact that the plaintiff had not filed a defence in Nova Scotia and that the defendant had relied upon defective legal advice did not materially affect the defendant."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issue of divorce, custody and access was disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. HELD: 1) The petitioner was to have judgment against the respondent for the sum of $113,155.19 less $15,580.00 (being the value of the assets in her possession) leaving a balance of $97,575.19 to be paid to the petitioner, less one-half the costs of the appraisals. The judgment shall be a charge on the respondent's personal land. 2) The respondent's gross income as of June 9, 1999 was $96,900.19. 3) The average capital cost on land and buildings should not be added back for purposes of determining respondent's income and for the purpose of the Guidelines. 4) There was no evidence as to whether the respondent owned any land at the time of the purchase of the land. The land was owned by the petitioner and not by the respondent. 5) The appraised contributory yard site for the NW 1/4 of 19-20-5-W3 was valued at $63,700. However, the respondent testified that he personally owned the garden shed valued $200 as shown on Exhibit P-1, page 12. In addition, the petitioner claimed that she personally owned a metal working chute with loading ramp valued $2,000. That sum must be added to the respondent to bring him to a level of income which is artificial just so it might appear he has the means with which to pay spousal support."
4_2005skqb542.txt,"The Government seeks an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the plaintiff to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and pursuant to Rule 173 of the Rules and order striking portions of the pleadings. HELD: 1) The plaintiff has failed to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for education of a group of people that included the plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government seeks an order requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars in order for it to properly defend the action and not be taken by surprise. The plaintiff cites samples of cases involving similar open ended phrases and submits that such wording is common and should be permitted by the courts. HELD: 1) The pleadings do not support a claim for damages for breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The Government is entitled to make and enforce regulations with respect to the standards of buildings, equipment, teaching, education, inspection and discipline in connection with residential schools for children. 2) There is no allegation in the appellants' pleadings that the Government acted in its own self-interest and against the interests of either party. The Plaintiff fails to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for the education of a group of people that included the Plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government. The claim for 'punitive and exemplary damages' is redundant. 3) In circumstances where the plaintiff has no particulars, he must provide particulars of same. The response that the particulars demanded are 'within the knowledge and peruse[sic] of the Defendant and as such, the Plaintiff is not obliged to provide further particulars'. 4) The plaintiff relies on Odger's Principles of Pleading in Civil Actions in the High Court of Justice, 22nd Ed. (London, 1981). 5) The Court is not prepared to strike the phrases complained of. The conduct of the Government in this proceeding evinces a breach of confidence. It is well established within the meaning of the Act that the government is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the residential school for children and the principles and laws of the common law apply. The practice in Canada has been considered by the Supreme Court of Canada and the Court of Appeal in number of recent judgments. 6) The evidence is inadequate to establish a foundation for a reasonable cause of action. The evidence does not exist to establish the prima facie case for the claim."
