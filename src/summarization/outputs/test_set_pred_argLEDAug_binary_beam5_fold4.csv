Judge applied the test that the justice of the peace `must be satisfied on reasonable grounds.' Substantial compliance found and warrant upheld.,"The respondent, a justice of the peace, issued a search warrant to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery. The applicants sought an order quashing the warrant on the grounds that the said search warrant was unlawfully and invalidly issued in excess of the jurisdiction of the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The sole ground upon which the Information was based was hearsay information from a confidential source and no details were provided in support of the informant's opinion or conclusion that such information is reliable. 2)The respondent acted within her jurisdiction in issuing the search warrant."
1990canlii2449.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","An unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old girl applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal social assistance. Her application was refused because she was under 19 years of age and was living with and being supported by her mother and stepfather. The Appeal Board quashed the application for certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board which confirmed the denial of the appellant's application for municipal assistance as an expectant mother. Dismissing the appeal without costs, that the Appeal Board erred in interpreting the Halifax Social Services policy 1.2.5 as a discretionary right to assistance. The fact that an unmarried mother, pending the birth of her first child, could qualify for assistance even if she was completely maintaining herself without any family support, was not evidence that she qualified as a person in need under the policy. If the interpretation given to M.S.A. Policy 1.3.5 in particular was correct, the appellant did not qualify within the definition of 'expectant mother' as defined by the earlier provisions of s. 19(e) of the Act and was not the respondent's stepfather who was the head of family and maintaining the household in which she lived."
1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The first mortgagee to the project, the second mortgagee, had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction which he acknowledged required him to pay the mortgage brokerage and architectural fees from the previous mortgage advance from the mortgagees. The project was financially tight from the very beginning. Some of the suppliers and creditors had become dissatisfied with the handling of the project funds by one of the principals of and was withdrawing its support. In early April, 1987, the project manager, who was retained by the plaintiff to act as general counsel, requested that the funds be disbursed contrary to the letter of direction dated March 9, 1987 and an apparently unacknowledged letter of directions dated March 16, 1987 providing for the payment of mortgage proceeds upon the signature of certain individuals only. The plaintiff's claims were separately argued with regard to negligent misrepresentation and breach of trust, but the subsequent issues of knowledge, reliance and causation rendered it appropriate to consider the various issues in the plaintiffs' claim together. Breach of Trust? The plaintiffs had not established the basis for a claim under breach of trusting and could not succeed on this ground. Any claim under this ground was dismissed."
1994canlii5055.txt,FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel. The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place. He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,The accused applied for a review of theterms of his judicial interim release. The charges arose as a result of picketing by the accused while carrying placards that allegedly constitute defamatory libel. Presumably the picketing prohibition term of the accused's release from custody was considered necessary by the justice who made the order to address the substantial likelihood that the accused would commit a criminal offence if he were not prohibited from picketing prior to his trial. HELD: The application was denied and the existing order stood.
1995canlii6138.txt,FIAT The Defendants were consulted by the Plaintiff and her mother 11 years earlier with respect to commencing an action for personal injuries arising out of a motor vehicle accident. The Plaintiff was only 12 at the time. No action was commenced with the result that the original action was now statute-barred. She waited 5 years after she attained the age of majority before taking this action against the Defendants. The Defendants applied to stay the action on the basis that they had never been retained. HELD: Application dismissed. Infants with bona fide causes are privileged suitors. An infant 'should not be visited with the sins of the next friends and litigation guardians who preceded him/her in the same action'.,"FIAT. The applicants, having destroyed their files, the death of the plaintiff's mother and the diminution of memories over a period of 11 years were partners in the practice of law. HELD: The application was dismissed but costs were to be paid to the trial judge. 1)The decision did not recognize the contingent element involved in the situation of an infant plaintiff. FIAT: The applicants have a good deal of sympathy for the applicants in this case. The plaintiff has not explained why she waited for five years after she attained majority before consulting counsel except to say that she did not believe she could do anything as result of the original advice she and her mother received from Judge Lavoie. 2)There is no indication as to who took over Dr. Leakos' files or whether he practised with others who may have his case histories and patient records. It is difficult to believe that there are not medical records available from some source which would outline the scope of the treatment and his diagnosis and prognosis for the plaintiff."

He was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,500 or 50 days in default, plus a victim fine surcharge of $250 and three years probation. The terms of the probation order included a direction that the respondent pay restitution to the victims in the amount of $300, that he not have contact with the victims and that he continue treatment with his psychiatrist. The Crown appealed the sentence, alleging that it inadequately reflected the element of deterrence. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge considered the correct principles of sentencing . This was a unique case where it was apparent that the respondent did not commit the offence for the usual reasons and that he required psychiatric treatment.","This was an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed by a Provincial Court judge for a break, enter and theft charge to which the respondent pled guilty. The respondent was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,500 or 50 days in default, plus a victim fine surcharge of $250 and three years probation.

The sentencing judge considered the correct principles of sentencing in this unique case."
1996canlii6754.txt,"A radio station reported that a 12 year old girl was dragged and sexually assaulted behind a roller rink or between the rink and a store. The owner of the rink claimed financial compensation for a subsequent decline in his business which he alleged was a direct result of the broadcast. The script and reel had been destroyed and it was impossible to recreate exactly what was aired. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing that the defendant published was false, malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. 2)The station followed the CRTC Regulations and was exonerated entirely by its controlling body. The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source. 3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation. The business was on a down side at the time. The assault occurring where it did was not the fault of either party. If it had a bearing on the immediate attendance figure it was minimal and the plaintiff did no promotion whatsoever to increase attendance.","The 12 year old girl and two juvenile offenders who had been roller skating at the Wheel-A-While Family Roller Rink in Prince Albert had been charged with sexual assault. The defendant refused to pay the charges and the matter was moved to trial. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant published the news that it received from the police, which was always a proven reliable source. 2)The attendance at the defendant's radio stations was down for several days after the sexual assault occurred. 3)The defendants did not cooperate with the CRTC. 4)The plaintiff did not have a cause of action against the defendant until it was established that the defendant had published the information contained in the files of the police. 5)The evidence was far from conclusive as to how the plaintiff's losses might have been caused by the assault or any other circumstance."
1997canlii786.txt,"The parties executed a separation agreement that resolved all matters corollary to their divorce and the Matrimonial Property Act. The respondent husband proceeded with an uncontested divorce. The appellant wife did not oppose the proceeding. She subsequently appealed the corollary relief judgment on the grounds that the underlying separation agreement is unconscionable and unduly harsh. She sought to introduce fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that even with the new evidence, the appellant still failed to demonstrate an adequate excuse for not responding to the divorce proceeding. There was no evidence that the appellant did not understand her legal entitlement at the time the agreements were signed, or that she did not appreciate that a divorce proceeding had been commenced.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children, one of which was in the joint custody of the parties. Upon separation, the appellant moved into the basement of the matrimonial home with the respondent. She claimed that she was suffering from lingering depression and that she entered into an improvident separation agreement to alleviate the symptoms of her depression. The respondent opposed the separation agreement, arguing that it was unconscionable and unduly harsh. Allowing the application to admit fresh evidence, that the appellant had not met the test for admission of fresh evidence and that, in the circumstances, it was unnecessary to consider whether or not she has a strong prima facie case for the agreement."
1997canlii9636.txt,The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.130 of the Land Titles Act and s.56 of the Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act for an order relieving the estate from payment of maintenance ordered in 1972. The respondent objected to the application being brought on behalf of the estate as Olson was neither executrix nor a beneficiary under the Will. The Will had not been admitted to probate. The respondent had divorced testator in 1972 and was granted child support of $60 per month and monthly spousal support of $40. The applicant who cohabited with the deceased since 1978 transferred her home to him in 1980 as joint tenants and he transferred his two and one-half quarter sections of farm land to the applicant. The applicant suggested there was an agreement whereby the respondent lived rent free in the matrimonial home in lieu of support. The respondent received welfare to support herself and the children and had had no funds to pursue enforcement of the unpaid support payments. HELD: 1)The style of cause was amended to show Olson as applicant. She was an interested party within the meaning of s.56 of the EMOA and entitled to bring the application on her own behalf. The respondent was not misled and there was no prejudice. 2)The Land Titles Act was of no assistance to the applicant. The application was to be determined upon s.56 of the EMOA and whether it would be grossly unfair and inequitable to refuse the application. 3)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge. There was no evidence presented either of consideration being paid nor of what became of the income generated by the land prior to the deceased's death.  4)A trial of an issue was ordered to determine what if any portion of the arrears should remain a charge upon the lands. Some of the evidence conflicted. Viva voce evidence should be heard.,"The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.130 of the Land titles Act S.S. c. L-5 and s.56 of The Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act (EMOA) for an order relieving the respondent Estate (the deceased) from payment of a maintenance order by Johnson J.(as he then was) on November 28, 1972. The decree gave the deceased custody of their two children who were then 10 and and child support of $60 per month. The applicant contends she received welfare to support herself and the children until 1981. During these years she had no funds with which to hire a lawyer to enforce the support payments which were due to her. HELD: The application failed. The respondent was not mislead and has not been prejudice.  1)The applicant was nether the executrix named in the Will and received $40 per month in arrears of support. She presented no evidence of the transfer of the land to her, there was no consideration being paid nor was there evidence of what became of the income generated by the land prior to the deceased's death.  2)The respondent was entitled to recover her right to recover a right to a service under s. 56 of the EMOA.  3)The question for resolution in whether it would in the words of the section be 'grossly unfair and inequitable' from the applicants perspective to refuse the application and whether such an order can be 'justified' in so far as the respondent is concerned was not answered by the trial of an issue.  4)S130 of The Land Titles Act is of no assistance to the applicant. This application failed to be determined upon s.55 of the Maintenance Order Act.  5)The application fails to have been determined upon the section of the maintenance order which constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge. It is up to a party seeking to deprive wife of these payments to establish on a balance of probabilities the conditions set out in s. 31.3(4) (now s.61 4) of the Act."
1997canlii9869.txt,"The appellant was convicted of failing a breathalyzer test. The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity. He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown.","This was an application for leave to appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court of Canada dismissing an appeal from the appellant's conviction under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code.

He stated that the readings were not consistent with the evidence of consumption given by the accused.

HELD: 1)The jury may be advised of the prior accident, its date, that proceedings were commenced in this Court and date of those proceedings and that the accident was ultimately settled and the action discontinued. The terms of the settlement and the sum paid were not to be disclosed. Beyond the issue of privilege which was a complete answer to the request, revisiting that action was a more critical problem. The sum paid to settle the first action was not allocated to any head of damages so those issues would have to be transversed as well. 2)The applicant may introduce his prior medical records with respect to the 1985 accident subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility. 3)The statement of claim in that action could not be entered at this trial as it was not evidence.  At best it was a series of allegations made against the prior defendant. The applicant could examine the respondent as to particulars of her claim in the earlier action and refer to material paragraphs. 4)The applicant was restricted to using the respondent's examination for discovery in the prior action for the purpose of cross-examination.  5)Costs were reserved to the trial judge. 6)The previous judge did not intend to reserve his decision with respect to the hearing of this motion and there was no impediment to the matter being reargued and disposed of.","FIAT. The judge reserved his decision with respect to the hearing of the applicant's motion in conjunction with the proposed trial of the action. The issues raised in the application were complicated and not at all clear in their implications. HELD: The terms of the settlement were not disclosed nor the sum paid to settle the claim. The settlement amount was not allocated to any head of damages so that those issues would have to be traversed also. The applicant may introduce these records into evidence subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility and the usual costs as to costs. The medical witnesses in question should not be referred to as part and parcel of the agreement.

1998canlii13585.txt,FIAT. Exclusive possesson and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner in May 1998. At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.,"FIAT. The parties were married for over 25 years and were now senior citizens. The petitioner sought an order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home. The court did not specify a date for the petitioner to move from the home. HELD: The respondent was entitled to exclusive possession. 1)No caselaw in support of the position of either party could be found. The issue resolved around the interpretation of two paragraphs of Rule 15 of the Court of Appeal Rules which provide: '15(1) unless otherwise ordered by the judge appealed from or by judge, the service and filing of notice of appeal does not stay the execution of a judgment or order pending the disposition of the appeal.' 2)The Court was of the view that the giving of directions by the court would not constitute the taking of any action or directing of any part of the action as would not contravene Rule 15. No writ of certiorari could be made, nor were required to be made. 3)The issue as whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession was raised in Young v.

HELD: Leave was granted to file a third party notice. 1)The low threshold for the establishment of a prima facie claim was met. 2)The delay would not be inordinate. The plaintiff's claim dated back to 1984. The parties were not ready for trial. No prejudice was established.  3)The third party's liability, if any, will have to be determined on a case by case basis.

The plaintiff alleges the applicant, the Attorney General of Canada, as the employer of Starr was responsible for his conduct. HELD: The application for leave is granted. There may well be some delay by allowing third party proceedings but it will not be inordinate. A pre-trial was ordered by consent of the parties. It was obvious from the material that the parties were not ready for trial.

2008skpc160.txt,"The accused is charged with aggravated assault. A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault. Prior to his trial, the accused gave notice that he would be making an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under s. 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter had been infringed and sought remedy for that infringement. At the trial, Crown counsel called six witnesses to testify and during the course of the evidence of the sixth witness, requested that the court enter a voir dire. HELD: The Court found that the initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported 'un-arrest' of the accused, and continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court did not find that his continued detention after the purported “de facto” arrest constituted a de facto arrest as described in Latimer. The accused was not only put in direct contact with Legal Aid duty counsel after having said that legal aid was fine, but he had the opportunity to consult counsel and was treated in all respects as though he was in custody after an arrest. The defence did not rely on the Supreme Court decision in R. Latimer, 1997 CanLII 405 (H.L.), which held that the police had made a conscious decision not to arrest the accused and that their treatment of him amounted to 'de facto' arrest and not an arbitrary detention, but rather, on his own initiative, and he was put in contact with that lawyer."
2011skpc153.txt,The accused was charged with dangerous driving. The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light. The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a highway in a manner that was dangerous to the public contrary to s.249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.

Rejecting the applications, that a Court of Appeal judge sitting in chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status or to join a person as a party to a proceeding. Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal.","The union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1) and to bring an appeal from orders made in 1999 and 1999 that the Union had been joined as an intervener by an application to the Supreme Court of Canada under Rule 62.35 and Rule 8. The Union opposed the application and sought extensions of time and place of service on the application. In issue was whether other submissions may advance the interests of the union and its members and oppose the position of the Intended, Defendant. HELD: The application to join the Union was dismissed. 1) The Union did not have the status to file an appeal unless it was joined as either a party to a proceeding or by an intervenor by order of the Court.  2) There were no reported decisions in this jurisdiction dealing with an application by a non-party to be added to proceeding as defendant, or as an Intended Defendant pursuant to Rule 5.03. The cases arising under this section are usually concerned with an applicant by an existing plaintiff to add an additional party as plaintiff or as defendant within the meaning of s. 44(1)(b) of the Judicature Act. The applications for intervention at the appeal level, in civil cases, were usually made by persons who are interested in an appeal. The new rule is significantly different from those made in Adams. It is the proper forum to enable both parties to adduce evidence in support of their respective opposed submissions. 3) In this case, the limits on the jurisdiction of a Chambers judge in this Court, as stipulated in Rule 62, constitute 'context' restricting the broad definition expressed in Rule 1.05(e)(i). 4) There are additional cogent reasons that influence me to refuse the relief requested."
2_2000skqb301.txt,"Plaintiff, as litigation guardian for his four daughters, alleged that the defendant, in breach of a trust, wrongfully retained $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled. Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000 to which his four daughters were entitled. The plaintiffs four granddaughters were born in the mother's name to the plaintiff. Mabel placed $17,500 in a bank account in the name of the plaintiff and added $8,000 in 1995 to the account as joint owner. The plaintiff died in March 1998 at which time the principal amount in the bank account was $25,000. HELD: The plaintiff was notified that the instructions were given to him by the mother. He became the trustee for the account for the benefit of the four grandchildren.  1)An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust and not merely to make a transfer. 2)The mother was not 'volunteer' not having given any consideration to either the Royal Trust Company or Royal Trust Corporation which would create an equity in her favour. 3)The instructions were written in the names of the plaintiffs' spouses and children. 4)The plaintiff was awarded costs of the action."
2_2000skqb53.txt,"An appeal from Provincial Court on a Small Claim. The Jabours, the third parties who acquired title to the house, firmly bolted a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Abilities Council by anchor bolts in a concrete slab. The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift. San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land. It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty. The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs giving a claim for damages. The Provincial Court judge dismissed the claim against the third party, the Jabours, on the facts.","An appeal from a Provincial Court decision on a Small Claim.

The plaintiff and her husband sold the property to the respondent, Elsa San Diego. The vendors advertised the property as being good revenue care home wheelchair accessible. When selling the property, the vendors made no mention to the purchaser, the respondent San Diego, about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The trial judge dismissed the claim against the Jabours on the facts as found by the Provincial Court Judge. In the circumstances, the appeal was dismissed both as it affects the plaintiff and the third party."

A fine was imposed pursuant to s. 238(1) of the Act. The defendant had filed for bankruptcy and argued that under s.168.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, he is discharged from all debts except matters referred to in subsection 178(1) of that Act.S. 238(1) of the Income Tax Act, falls within the definition of any fines, penalties, and restitution order as set out in s. 178(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.  The Court's jurisdiction to make an order pursuant to s. 238(1) of the Income Tax Act is unaffected by a bankruptcy proceeding.","The respondent, who was an officer and director of the Halifax Regional Protection Services, received a Certificate of Discharge pursuant to the provisions of S.168.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, discharging and releasing him from all debts except matters referred to in s.178(1) of that Act. At the time the 12 guilty pleas were tendered and the fines imposed, there was a dispute between the Crown and the respondent regarding the implication of outstanding bankruptcy proceedings in relation to the issuance of s. 238(2) compliance order. HELD: A compliance order falls within the definition of 'any fine, penalty, restitution order or other order similar in nature to a fine or penalty order imposed by a Court in respect of an offence...' as set out in section 238(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act. Such matters were unaffected by the bankruptcy proceedings and the certificate of discharge arising therefrom. 1)The Crown did not contest the Defence submission relative to the facts and circumstances surrounding the offences. The evidence did not reveal whether the accountant or investor were officers, directors or shareholders in the company. 2)It is the Crown's position that 1) The authority of the Court to make an order under s.238(2 is irrelevant because the information presented by the defence was of a person of relatively limited financial means with limited employment prospects. However, the guilty pleas tendered by the respondent represented either a waiver or an acceptance that these defences and limitations did not apply to his liability under the Income tax Act as a party to the offences nor to the sentence to be imposed pursuant to s.241(2). Expressed in another fashion, the Crown, in light of the respondent's guilty pleas, need not establish the existence of the matters set out therein. 3) The Crown has jurisdiction to issue an order pursuant to subsection 238(3) ordering payment of the amount of $22,069.23 to the Receiver General and if do, whether such an order should be made."

Application dismissed; the accused had not met the onus on the balance of probabilities of establishing that the former Superintendent had relevant or material evidence to offer concerning the issues raised by the Charter motions.

The plaintiffs sought substantially increased costs on the basis that the defendant should have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. Solicitor and client fees totaled over $21,000. Costs fixed at $10,000 plus disbursements; there was no obligation on the defendant to admit liability but considering the amount of legal fees incurred in relation to the amount recovered, it was appropriate to go outside the tariffs.","Counsel had been unable to agree on costs after a four day trial. The plaintiffs were successful in recovering the base amount claimed but did not succeed in their claims for aggravated and punitive damages. The defendant should be substantially increased above the usual party and party costs because, as he contended, the trial extended over 4 days and it did not unduly prolong the proceeding. Costs should be calculated on the amount involved under Tariff A.  Costs awarded to the plaintiffs in the amount of $15,000 plus disbursements of $2,957.83 for a total of $21,663.48. This may appear to be a disproportionate amount of costs in view of the relatively moderate recovery. However, it was necessary for the plaintiffs to recover some money and to contribute to the recovery.

The mother's decision to move was not in the children's best interests and it was done either to frustrate or with a callous indifference to the children's relationship with their father.","The parties, who were married in 1993 and separated in May 2005, applied to vary the existing order. The application was held before Justice Dellapinna of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal and the court ordered that the children remain in the custody of their father, who was living in Halifax at the time of the application. The court found that it was in the children's best interests to be in the father's care beyond the end of the school year. The children's extracurricular activities were to be suspended during two weeks of block holiday time (see Gordon v. Goertz).

The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian.

The accused was on duty in a marked police car when the accused's vehicle rolled forward and collided with another vehicle. The second part of the Sault Ste. Marie test was whether the accused exercised due diligence applying an objective test in assessing carelessness and whether he has then shown, on balance of probabilities, that he exercised Due diligence in the context of the circumstances he encountered. The actions of the accused which could be considered careless are the speed at which he drove past the stopped vehicle, the location of the cross-walk, and his driving forward into the other vehicle. HELD: The officer who stopped his vehicle was found not guilty of this charge. 1) The officer's evidence was that he did not touch the accelerator, and briefly took his foot off the brake, and then immediately reapplied the brake after seeing the vehicle which was positioned directly in front of the police car at this time. The Crown suggested that the officer thought the vehicle could slow down and that this vehicle did not accelerate and did not move quickly before striking the accused. The officer was acquitted of the charge of careless driving. 2) The Court of Queen's Bench judge Raymond Tynadall was satisfied that the accused drove careless. He could not have reasonably anticipated that a person would have been so close to him and he did exercise due diligence, or took reasonable care, on this date."

HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused was charged with being at large on her undertakings given to Justice or Judge and being bound to comply with conditions including that she abstain from all use, consumption and possession of alcohol and that she was not impaired by alcohol at the time she made the demand. The accused testified that she knew the alcohol would kick in and she wasn't really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of all counts. The certificate of analysis was not admissible because the breathalyzer demand was not made forthwith or as soon as practicable. The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the demand as there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:45 am. to justify the breath demand and the evidence did not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by Alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of s. 8 and 9 of the Charter of Rights, it should be excluded under Section 24(2).

Based on the tire tracks, the appellant was charged with dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described. HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. While no accident reconstructionist was available to check the accident scene after the incident, the Crown could have called an expert to testify whether the defence's theory could hypothetically be rational.

Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months. The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","The accuseds were found guilty after trial of committing two offences contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code, and with intent to commit an indictable offence, having their faces masked.

2_2008nssm16.txt,"The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding.  Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","The claimant claimed damages for a house sale because the disclosure statement did not disclose a history of repeated flooding. The claimant alleged that the home had flooded 12 years ago and that it was somehow collateral to the main PSA. The defendant argued that by allowing the claimant's testimony, the court would be able to infer that there had been a fundamental breach of contract that would lead to total lack of interest on the part of the Appellant. The court reviewed the law on motions for non-suit and found that the principles of law and the facts which were induced in evidence are at times referred to as warranties. It found that most warranties survive the closing of a contract by virtue of the fact that the property was not flooded at the time the sale was made. To allow the parties to present all the facts that can be proven in a court of law manner, without having to elect whether or not to call evidence, is a step in the right direction. It is not the court's role to impose its own warranties."
2_2008skca172.txt,"The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was convicted by a Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing the death of Tanya Bergen, contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm to Helen McDermott. He was sentenced to five years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. He appealed both his conviction and sentence imposed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge clearly had discretion pursuant to the Corbett decision to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. However, this was not a jury trial. Nor did the trial judge himself appear to place any weight on these questions or in any way shift the onus of proof to the accused. The appellant's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved within the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath was clearly prejudicial, and was unfairly designed to create an impression of the accused who was then the driver of the truck. 2)In all of the circumstances of this case the appellant was prejudiced by the questions and the appellant's responses were relatively innocuous and did not play major role in the evidence of the appellant."

Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2) For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The case was decided on the basis of credibility. The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused. The Court stated that, on all the evidence, it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged.","The defendant was charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with the use of a searchlight when hunting. The vehicle was observed to travel approximately 14 kilometres in an easterly direction, and then turn north for a short distance on the Torch Trail. At the onset of the trial, the Crown closed its case and the sole defence witness was the defendant. The defendant was found not guilty of the charge. All of the indicia of hunting at night with the searchlight are present in this case. It cannot escape notice that there were two loaded firearms in the vehicle; the rifle that was in the back seat had one live round in the chamber and four live rounds in the magazine; the ammunition found in the truck was compatible with the two rifles that were seized. However, there were some uncontroverted facts which were consistent only with an inescapable inference that the defendant was using the flashlight for the purposes of hunting wildlife. On all of the evidence, the accused was convinced of his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The Crown bears the burden throughout the case and must be satisfied on the evidence that do accept the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict."

They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.  , the file will be sealed. While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does. The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies. A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs. Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough. Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents). Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered. The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation.","The parties had both requested an order to seal the contents of their divorce file. They had done so after receiving a request from the media to examine that file. The media request was made according to the provisions of Civil Procedure Rule 59.60. The salutary effects of a sealing order do outweigh its deleterious effects in these circumstances because the public interest in an open court is not completely circumscribed by this order. The court has supervisory and protecting power over its own records. Little that is filed in the Family Division is filed voluntarily. Most of the material in the file must be filed by the rules of court and, on occasion, court order. This requires a public interest and social interest imbedded in the expectation of privacy and confidentiality for personal identifiers and the risk of identity theft is real. Both parties sought to have the file sealed to protect their reputation, their reputation against unproven allegations that may be contained in material filed in this proceeding. The applicant and respondent sought exclusion of the public on the date of the hearing and in a separate file, not accessible to the public, unless party makes a motion within the required time. There was no publication ban."

The applicant applied for an order varying the support provisions of a 1989 judgment. He sought an order requiring a total payment of $570.75 per month for both children. The respondent opposed the application. HELD: An order for a trial of the issue. 1)The respondent wife was to have custody of the children of the marriage. She was to receive full time employment. 2)The applicant husband was to maintain all medical, dental, drug and other health benefit plans currently available through his employment with General Motors. 3)The parties had agreed to a reduction in the maintenance from $1,200 per month to $500 per month.

3_1997canlii11384.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. who was alleged to be of unsound mind. H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing. The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected. If the court failed to intervene H.B. will be left in limbo, a victim of the system.","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for the mother of the child. The child was apprehended at birth and is the subject of a child protection hearing. The applicant took the position that it was not appropriate to act as a litigation guardian on behalf of H.B. and that the court's inherent jurisdiction did not give it the jurisdiction to represent an adult under mental disability in cases other than where a property interest was involved. HELD: An order was issued pursuant to s. 32 of The Child and Family Services Act and an order was to be made for an assessment unless the public trustee, within 10 days from the date of this order, showed cause as to why it wasn't the appropriate party to act.  1)The Public trustee in this province has acted in a number of child protection cases to protect the interests of a mentally deficient parent who is unable to act on his/her own behalf. 2)There was no order as to costs."
3_1998canlii1477.txt,"The plaintiff was subcontracted by the City of Dartmouth to build a sports field. The defendant were the project consultants for the City, and were involved throughout the tendering process and construction. Their report indicated a number of significant potential problems. The plaintiff was not made aware of the report when it bid on the project. The plaintiff subsequently became aware of the problems, which made their work more costly. After completing the work, it commenced a claim for the additional work which had to be performed due to the undisclosed site conditions. The defendants were joined by the City as a third party to that action. The plaintiff was successful at trial, but the decision was overturned on appeal. The plaintiff then commenced the present action directly against the defendant, alleging negligent misrepresentation. The defendant applied to strike the action on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. Granting the application, that the present cause of action is the same one litigated in the first action, simply under a different legal concept.

Shortly after commencing the work, the City found that there were significant subsurface problems with the site which made the work more difficult and costly.

3_1999canlii12258.txt,An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,"The appeal was from an order which varied a child maintenance order. The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into about a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The judge at the hearing of the appeal was faced with conflicting affidavits. She thought that evidence was required on only three issues which she proceeded to define. The appellant argued that he was denied the right to lead evidence respecting matters relevant to the issues between the two parties. HELD: The portion of the judgment relating to payments under s. 7(1)(f) of the Guidelines was set aside. The appeal was dismissed. 1) The judge erred in requiring the appellant to pay a portion of them under s7.1(f) in addition to the table amount fixed under s3(1(a). 2) There was no reversible error in the judge's decision, explained in the reasons for judgment, to reject the appellant's arguments respecting that issue. Similarly, we can not see that the appellant was deprived of any relevant issue and we reaffirm the principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley (1996), 137 Sask. R. 295 (Sask. C.A.). 3) Another ground of appeal concerned the $230 per month ordered to pay in respect of extracurricular activities with the meaning of s. 17(6.2)of the Divorce Act by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order, which, the appellant argued contained special provisions to benefit the children. He argued these expenses fell within the standard definition of 'ordinary' activities, which included living expenses and maintenance. Absent any evidence to the contrary, it seems to us that the activities were ordinary activities and the expenses were of an ordinary rather than an extraordinary nature, given the income of these children's parents."

The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles. The R. v. Emke decision is outdated. 3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty. There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over the legal limit contrary to ss.255(b) and ss.253(a). At trial, only one witness was called. The Crown called a peace officer who was on duty in uniform and driving a marked police vehicle. The officer observed the vehicle displayed an out of date sticker on it's license plate in violation of ss.27(5) and 26 of the Highway Traffic Act. The police officer engaged the vehicle for approximately 2 minutes before engaging in a search for open liquor. At the end of the search, the officer asked the accused if he could act because he was within the jurisdiction of the city police. The accused blew 170 and 160 respectively on the breathalyser tests. HELD: 1)The police officer was not responsible for policing when there was an agreement between the province and the federal government. It would not be appropriate for the legislature to limit the opportunity for policing of community by making sure fewer police officers are able to act in any particular setting within the province. The Police Act must be read in a context as providing a manner of funding policing not as taking away jurisdiction granted to R.C.M.P. officers by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act. 2)There was no good public policy reason for the police officer to be excluded from operating in any specific geographic area. 3)The stopping of the vehicle was a routine check conducted to ensure that the accused's papers were in order and he had valid driver's licence. 4)The officers were authorized to search the vehicle and conducted their duties within the meaning of s. 27(5). The police Act requires that all police officers must perform their duties in the lawful execution of their duties. In this case the officer was acting within his jurisdiction and had jurisdiction to make the demand. 5)The Court concluded that the stopping was a random stop and that the Crown's intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country was clear, broad and unambiguous. The words 'are assigned' refer to the three distinct objects and not to specific areas of jurisdiction. The purpose of the words “are assigned” to refer to something specific, rather than a particular geographic area, was not to determine what the law was and what the scope of his duties and responsibilities were. 6)Costs in the amount of $10,000 were awarded to the"

The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths. HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000. 1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention. This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home.

They agreed in their wills that after their deaths their entire estates would be left to their respective children. They each completed new wills shortly after the marriage to this effect. HELD: 1) The petitioner was entitled to judgment for half of the value of the assets acquired after marriage being: one-half of the Value of the Melville home owned prior to the marriage was exempt from distribution in accordance with the parties' agreement at that time. It has not increased in value and the maintenance of the home was born solely by the petitioner during the years of marriage.  2) There was no 'extraordinary circumstance' as provided in s. 22(1) of the Act which would prevent the values of the family home from being divided equally between the parties. The petitioner's investments and assets increased significantly during the time the parties lived together. 3) The court was not satisfied there was any unusual circumstance under s.22(1)(a) as provided by the Act. The property was subject to a verbal agreement made at the marriage that each would own what they had and would not make claim on the other's assets. 4) The respondent was not entitled by reason of his verbal agreement that all assets should be subject to the distribution of distribution."

The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01. The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence. The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting.

3_2003skqb93.txt,"The company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by its creditor pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide. He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status. HELD: The Proposal was accepted.  1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA. The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation. Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.  3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","W.R.T.

The proponents are in agreement with the second ground of Mr. Tilk's objection that the pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor than the unsecured creditors who had been represented by him and preferred to be classified in a other category of creditor. Taking into account the interests of the debtor (to give him an opportunity to meet with his creditors and to find a way of producing assets or revenue which will provide them with a dividend outside of bankruptcy), the general body of creditors (to protect creditors generally by insuring that what is put up by way of proposal is a reasonable one), and the public-at-large in maintaining the integrity of bankruptcy legislation (including considering whether or not the proposal complies with standards of commercial morality), the proposed amended para. 9.1 was consistent with the provisions of ss. 50(13) of the BIA and it was ordered accordingly."

She contends that the chambers judge erred in varying the order for maintenance and reducing the amount of arrears in the absence of evidence that there was a change in the conditions, means and needs of the respondent or the children as contemplated by s. 17(4) of the Divorce Act.[FOOTNOTE 1][2] The respondent contends that the amount of child support should be reduced by reason of his reduced income caused by his unemployment or reduced employment over the last four years. The appellant argues that the respondent has failed to satisfactorily explain his unemployment. There is evidence that his change in income is due to his own voluntary action and, as a result, he has failed to establish the threshold 'change in circumstances' which could result in a variation of the order.

There is evidence from which this Court can impute income to the respondent in the amount of $27,000, and the child support shall be varied to $510.00 per month as of February 1, 2004 in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines.

3_2004skqb379.txt,"FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","FIAT. The respondent applied to vary the support and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 consent judgment. The consent judgment provided for the divorce of the petitioner and distribution of matrimonial property estate to the couple as well as custody, access and support for the child of the marriage. At issue was whether there should be variation of the custody order and child support. HELD: The respondent's application was dismissed. The material change in circumstances did not warrant a variation. The existing access order allows the respondent to define the extent of access or time spent with each of his parents. There was no change to the 1995 access order. The present respondent should be alive to the fact that Letitia deserves significant amounts of time to pursue her own interests, activities and independence. It is clear that her best interests require that the status quo be continued. 1) The mere passage of time in this instance would constitute a material change of circumstance relevant to custody. 2) The respondent should not be offended by this conclusion. Rarely would court of law be so bold as to try to mandate an intelligent, mature and wholesome 15-year-old's custody in the circumstances that prevail here. Both parents are in fact to be congratulated that they have parented Letitia to be who she is today. 3) There have been no changes to the access order and the material change threshold has not been met."

Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment; in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused.","The accused, who had previously entered guilty pleas to eight counts contained in an indictment, now plead guilty to three counts of breaking and entering.

HELD: The appropriate sentence is a term of four years and six months in a federal institution, followed by a period of six years incarceration. The aggravating circumstances of the break and enters and the fact that the accused was driving his vehicle upset gave rise to the idea that he might be the person who broke into the premises and stole the goods.

The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by. The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry.

The defence applied to exclude the letter on the basis that it was obtained by an unreasonable search or seizure and thereby violated the accused's right under s.8 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The letter was not an alibi. It was an honest admission by the accused that he was not at the Eureka Club at the time of the robbery and that he attempted to manufacture a alibi by perjury. 2)The accused's failure to identify the accused in the photo ID line-up was a mere fabrication. 3)His failure to take the opportunity to look at the accused directly and without obstruction was not a reason to suspect or reject his evidence that he identified the accused three and one-half months after the robbery. 4)The only conclusion drawn was that the accused was trying to deceive the jury and that his admission by way of a letter to the defence was a fabrication which was not supported by the evidence at trial. 5)The adverse inference was not drawn against the accused by his attempt to fabricate the alibi but was drawn by the testimony of his girlfriend who was standing between him and the robber. 6)There was no other explanation in evidence for the request for the false evidence.

He questioned the validity of service by mail arguing personal service was required. HELD: Whether the appellant was validly served is an issue that will properly presented to and determined by the Court hearing the appeal. Bringing an application under Queen's Bench Rule 271 would have been a more expeditious procedure. The stay was granted since this was the type of appeal that can be expedited.

Costs were reserved to the Court hearing the appeal.,"The appellant appealed an order in Queen's Bench granting him child support. He argued that personal service was required. He also sought an order staying execution and garnishment proceedings with respect to s. 2 and para. 4 of the above order. HELD: The appeal was granted. The appellant was granted stay. He did not appear in chambers on the return date of the application for variation and now questions the validity of service by mail. He now questions whether the appellant was validly served under the Queen’s Bench Rules. The issue will have to be properly presented and determined by the division of the Court hearing the appeal.  1) The appellant received the material in the mail but decided not to appear because he did not have the benefit of any evidence or submissions from the appellant. The judge decided the application on the evidence before him. 2) His non-appearance at the hearing was a factor in his decision to take enforcement proceedings.  3) He now moved for an order under rule 15 staying execution/garishment proceedings under rule 271 (Any verdict or judgment obtained where one party does not appear at trial, may be set aside by the court upon such terms as may be just, upon an application made within 15 days after the trial."
4_2004skqb19.txt,"The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant. The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident. What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence. Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend.","The applicant applies by originating a motion for a declaration that the respondents are obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against them and others by Genex Swine Group Inc. (the 'underlying action'). The applicant specifies that each of the respondents issued comprehensive general liability policies in favour of the applicant. The respondents take the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend (and to pay defence costs) for the claims brought against Westridge and others in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The applicant's legal allegations are properly pleaded. 2) The onus of establishing that the terms of the policy obligate the insurer to defend rests with the applicant, who is not bound by the legal labels chosen by the plaintiff. The mere fact that Genex alleges both negligence and a breach of contract is of no moment sufficient to change the insurer's duty to defend.  3) The liability for compensatory damages is limited to 'bodily injury or property damage' which occurs during the policy period. 4) Occurrence 'Occurrence' includes continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which result in loss neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the Insured. 5) The insurer must look beyond the choice of labels and examine the substance of the allegations contained in the pleadings. This does not involve deciding whether the claims have any merit; all court must do is decide based on the true nature of the claims."
4_2005nssc253.txt,"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.","This was an application for an order for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment under Rule 31.01. The plaintiff was making a significant claim yet when one listened to defendant's counsel and read the material attached to his lawyer's affidavit, one found there were significant other factors affecting the plaintiff's health. Judgement was entered against the defendant as to liability for the accident and against the plaintiff as to the amount of damages to be assessed. The defendant argued there should be an 'air of realty' to the plaintiffs argument that she had not been able to establish that the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries. The court granted the appeal and set aside the order of the trial judge. It is not the function of the court in determining the matter of an interim payments to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them. A summary judgment is not to be allowed when there is an arguable issue to be tried, namely, that even if one accepts the defendant's evidence, one has to consider the issue of contributory negligence."
4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","The parties, who were married in November 1980 and began living separate and apart in August 1993, entered into an oral agreement in which the respondent was to pay monthly spousal and child support of $2,000. There was no financial contribution by the mother to the children in the father's care. The father paid by post-dated cheques directly to the mother and the mother destroyed any cheques she received in the previous amount; the father took responsibility for $9,000 in arrears; and for the cost of the children's education, which was not part of the agreement. The agreement was recognized by Maintenance Enforcement, who returned the post dated cheques from the respondent in October 2005 and requested enforcement of the amount in the original order. The respondent did not contest this method of providing child support. The standard variation clause is contained in the Separation Agreement and refers to s. 17 of the Divorce Act. The mother alleged that she received no money in September and October 2005, when the children left the mother's care and moved with the father and his spouse to Nova Scotia, leaving her with no income and no savings, pre-separation RRSP's or equity in the home. She claimed that she had no difficulty continuing in future to pay the costs of his children's post secondary education but had difficulty dealing with her father directly to obtain support. She alleged she owed $69,500 in matrimonial debt and any other debt in his name. HELD: The mother's claim was dismissed with costs to Maintenance Enforcement in the amount of $25,000 to be paid directly by the father in the form of lump sum payments of $15,000, payable in August 2005 and September 2006. The amount owing under the old agreement was $52,000 and there was no change in the defendant's obligations under the Corollary Relief Judgment. The defendant was ordered to pay $1,836 per month in support and the balance of that amount was garnishee in place until the date of this hearing. The court ordered that the defendant pay the full amount owing in the 2005 and 2006 child support payments, plus any costs incurred in the years since the separation and divorce, in accordance with the terms of the original agreement. In addition, the defendant was to deduct any costs from the maintenance payable in the coming years. The plaintiff's claim for costs for the two youngest children was dismissed pending the outcome of the hearing on this ground. It would be unfair to the defendant to deprive the plaintiff of the plaintiff"
4_2017skqb205.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8 The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim. ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA). They sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to ss. 5(7) of the EMJA, and $40,000 security for costs. The plaintiffs argued they had failed to prosecute this action without delay. Application to amend the order granted in part; application to add the plaintiff; and amendment of the statement of claim granted. HELD: 1) The preservation order was granted pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 3-72 and 3-84. The matter is whether the facts on which the Order was based have changed. That is so despite the fact that the plaintiff has chosen to await the outcome of the Turkish Proceedings before taking any steps to advance this action. It is their position that this action is totally independent and that even if there is some logic in securing the Turkish judgment before dealing with enforcement, that approach became unacceptable once the impact of the order was in place. The addition of the plaintiff would not create a wholly new proceeding. 2) The court has a discretion to exercise its discretion to order the plaintiff added as a plaintiff and amend the Statement of Claim in the manner proposed. There is sufficient temporal and factual relationship between the occurrences. The two conditions specified in ss. 20(a) and (b) are met.  3) It is open to the court to terminate a preservation order granted by consent pursuant to S.5(7)(a) or order that a portion of the proceeds be used to enforce a payment obligation made by the defendant to the plaintiff. 3) In the alternative, the plaintiff may apply to have the order reduced. The court will consider whether the proposed changes to the original pleadings must not be so dramatic as to effectively create a separate proceeding. 4) The Court has a discretionary discretion to be exercised judicially limited by the requirements listed in s. 20 of The Limitations Act. The Court is satisfied that neither of the defendants will suffer actual prejudice as a result of the proposed amendments. 5) The application to vary the preservation orders may be made in any event. 6) In any event, the Court may order an order changing the nature of the transactions. 7) The escrow agreement and preservation order shall remain in effect until a further court order of Saskatchewan court is made. 8) This application should be disposed of pursuant to Rule 5(1"
5_1994canlii4347.txt,"The plaintiff was found to be two-thirds and the defendant one-third responsible for an accident which occurred when the defendant's car hit the plaintiff as she tried to cross the highway on her bicycle. The court awarded costs to the plaintiff fixed at the amount involved - the quantum of general damages. The parties were unable to reach an amount of settlement. In this matter, the defendant argued that the costs should be fixed at the amount actually recovered by the plaintiff. Awarding the plaintiff one-third of her taxed costs, that to reduce costs by the percentage of fault of the plaintiff and to reduce the amount involved would be a double reduction.","The plaintiff was found two-thirds responsible for the injuries suffered when the defendant's vehicle struck her while she was attempting to cross the No. Highway. Damage was determined at $1,255.25. The defendant agreed to apportion costs in the amount of $50,000 to the plaintiff, with interest for six years at 9.41 percent per annum and disbursements at 1% less the Counterclaim. The plaintiff submits that the award to her is 1/2 of that amount. Counsel for the defendant states that if costs are to be awarded, the discount rate of 2.5% is appropriate. An injustice is done which requires interference by an appeal court with such an exercise of discretion. 2) Civil Procedure Rule 41A.09 is applicable and the plaintiff is entitled to double his costs. In this case, the Court was unable to agree on any issues. 3) Apportionment of costs in a motor vehicle negligent case, consistent with findings of fault, should be avoided in the exercise of trial judge's discretion under ss. 41(i) and (k) of the Judicature Act. The conclusion must be that to the extent inflation was taken into account for the period between the accrual of the cause of action and the trial, the court should exercise its discretion to adjust the interest rate so it is not taking into account a second time. This practice has been sanctioned by the Appeal Division in Tzagarakis v. Stevens (1968), N.S.R. (1965) 453. The Appeal Division allowed the appeal and apportioned costs of the original Notice of Trial and Statement of Claim, initially with a jury, and the Record for Trial Judge in March 1993 to the defendant. The trial judge awarded the plaintiff half of its costs on a Tariff 'A' scale and fixed the amount involved at $25,000. In the circumstances the court was not disposed to award costs on the counterclaim. Limitation on the period during which pre judgment interest will run at the rate of 1% will run."

The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay. There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.","FIAT: The accused applies for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada quashing Count #1 of the indictment on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. HELD: The application to quash counts #1 and #2 is dismissed. In light of the Crown’s decision not to proceed with the trial of the co-accused, who was convicted on a charge of defrauding ICC of money in excess of $1,000 contrary to ICC guidelines, and following the separate trial and conviction of the second accused, the Crown amended the indictment to charge the accused with conspiracy to defraud and breach the single transaction rule.  1) The Court found that there was clearly no promise by the Crown that it would be bound in its proceedings against the accused by the findings of Klebuc J. in relation to the current indictment. It would be beneficial to both the accused and the Crown to have the benefit of the judgment in the current matter before proceeding with the Leibel trial.  2) The Crown would consider an application to order the indictment separated pursuant to ss. 590 if the accused could show that it was prejudicial to put the complex indictment to a jury."
5_2001canlii345.txt,"The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act, 1997. The accused owned a tractor-trailer unit that was overweight by 16,300 kilograms. There were three sets of axles on the unit- steering axle, drive axles and tridem axles. No overweigt permits had been issued to the accused and so he was prohibited from driving the unit. Signs warning and advising of weight restrictions were located along highway #332. There was no publication in any local newspaper or provincial daily. The Department of Highways had erected signs in the area advising of an alternative truck route and directing highway users to follow designated truck route. No other notice was given to the municipal division in which the grid roads were located or to entities that were involved in the transport of goods. HELD: The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. Even if it could be said that the steps taken by the municipality were sufficient to satisfy the requirement of a copy of the original order, the Minister could not establish that an order had been made for the purpose of this case.  1)It was mandatory for the minister to give notice of an order issued pursuant to section 35 of the Provincial Highway Traffic Act (HTA). The municipality was given authority to advise persons in their municipal division affected by the weight restriction and to advise other persons in the immediate area that were in the business of hauling. Traffic signs were in place along the highway leading to and from various grid roads. 2)The Minister did not advise the accused whose custody she was in. The municipality appeared to have taken sufficient steps to set out the required governing document for the purposes of this offence.  3)The Ministry did not refer to the admissibility of the minister's order as proof of its commission. Section 7(a) has no bearing on whether or not the Minister placed sufficient copies in the public custody of persons whose custody it was necessary to bring the regulation to the attention of the public or those persons affected by it."

The wife requested a 50% increase based on the husband's income increase of 50%. She suffered from MS and was unable to work. HELD: Spousal support was varied to $3,500 monthly. The only material change in the wife's means and needs is that fact she is residing with a new partner who resides in her home in exchange for yard work and housework.

The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","This was an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the respondent was subordinate to that of the R.M. even though the mortgage was registered before the mortgage of the respondent. The appeal argued that the trial judge was inconsistent with the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 (LTA), and that permitting the respondent to enforce the covenant to postpone contained in the Grant Agreement between the appellant and the respondent violated the principle of privity of contract. The respondent agreed to a delay in favour of the applicant, which allowed the applicant to apply for a mortgage of a limited interest. The trial judge found that the applicant's fee simple mortgage had priority over the respondent's mortgage, as the applicant had agreed to purchase the land from the CPR and that its interest would be subordinate to mortgages granted by the mortgagor for certain purposes. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the LTA is only effective pursuant to the terms of the instrument and law on which the interest is based and is not subject to fraud, which is not alleged in this case.

The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was charged with impaired operation, operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated and breach of his s.7 rights, Police Warning and Demand for a Blood Sample. The accused made self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of his belief that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly. The police officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation and read him his Charter rights, the police warning and demand for a blood sample and was'relatively co-operative throughout.' HELD: The accused's statements were excluded from the trial pursuant to s.24(2) of the Charter. The evidence received, the statements in particular were self- incriminating and conscriptive. If the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-initiating statements, such statements would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions of the officer. The defence argued that the arrest was illegal and excluded all evidence obtained thereafter, or at least that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police cannot rely on that information to make the demand. The Crown argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon evidence obtained by a breach of the accused's s. 7 rights and were motivated by a violation of that right, the exclusion of those statements would leave the accused with nothing but doubt as to his motives."
5_2008nssc77.txt,"The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract. The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","The claimants commenced an action for breach of contract against the respondent in the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench. The respondent did not file a defence and the claimants obtained default judgment for an amount not cited in either parties' submissions. The claim for a breach of agreement was reduced from the amount of its judgment to fall within the monetary limits established by the Small Claims Court Act and in the alternative, enforcement of the debt as contract. The parties agreed the issues on appeal were matters of law and the Standard of Review was correctness. The issue was whether Section 9 of the Act could be interpreted to include claims arising out of a foreign judgment. The Alberta action concluded with the issuance of the default judgment. Rather than determine a claim based on a fixed amount, it was apparent an adjudicator would be called upon first to settle a dispute regarding the original Court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract, and a factual dispute concerning attornment. Taking into account the purpose of the legislation, the remedial goals, the underlying values of efficiency and access to justice, and the potential for a complex fact finding process, the present claim extended beyond the authority of the small claims court."

A Registrar may assess any bill for legal services, provided that the application is filed within 30 days or more if a judge makes a discretionary order to extend the period for assessment if it is in the interests of justice to do so. The issue if whether the applicant's two bills fall with the said 30 days or if this is a case where it is appropriate to abridge the time for allowing an assessment. HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment. The bills were issued in two separate matters. In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue. There will be no extension of time for the first bill. The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it. He was advised that the bill would be adjusted. An initial adjustment was made and when still not satisfied, ongoing discussions about the bill continued. The Court held that the last document received by the applicant was not the final bill as it was still subject to change. In this case, the lawyer has been paid from monies held in trust for the client, the time being abridged is relatively short and neither party has alleged that any prejudice would result.","The applicant seeks an order pursuant to s. 67(1) of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of his legal bills for services rendered by the respondent. HELD: The application is dismissed. The court is not satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to abridge the time and order the assessment. The evidence before the court is that the Back-Track matter and the BASF matter were separate actions. The last bill was not given to the applicant until after the expiration of the time set out in the billing document. The May 29, 2007 account was on the file and had not been previously forwarded. There were discussions between the applicant and the registrar concerning the appropriateness of the account at the time the account was rendered, and for period of time thereafter. Neither party has alleged or established that any prejudice would result from the abridgement of time. The Court is satisfied that the application for assessment will be dismissed."
5_2016skqb384.txt,"Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, of driving with a blood alcohol content of over.08 on the following grounds: The trial judge erred in law in finding there was no breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights; the trial judge failed to consider that other cars had previously made a tight turn as evidenced by other tire tracks in the soft snow; the appellant pulled over for a roadside warning and there was an odour of alcohol on her breath. The roadside warning was ineffective and the officer did not observe any signs of impairment. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) On the whole of the evidence, there was sufficient evidence, when viewed objectively, to support the officer's contention that the appellant was impaired by alcohol. The standard of review is that of a reasonable person standing in the shoes of the officer would have believed the individual had not impaired her ability to operate a motor vehicle. Not every person who is legally impaired requires assistance to walk or enter a vehicle. The police officer is not required to have overwhelming evidence of impairment; and not every person, legally or otherwise, required assistance to exercise their right to walk, enter vehicle or motor vehicle without assistance is a factor of reasonable and probable grounds. 2) The appeal court must assess the reasonableness of the decision on whether the appellant challenged the validity of the breath demand based on the factors articulated by the officer as forming the factual basis for making the demand for a breath sample. There was no palpable or overriding error in law. 3) The officer had four and one year's experience at the time of the incident. He did not make any notation about the smell of alcohol in his field notes. While this may have been the precipitating factor in the officer to investigate the driver of the vehicle to determine if the driver was affected by alcohol, it was not the only basis upon which the officer formed his decision that the accused was impaired."
5_2017skqb167.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – VariationFamily Law – Custody and Access – Voices of the Children Report In 2012, after a trial, it was determined that the child should be parented on a shared basis with a one-week rotation between parents. An order was never issued and therefore, no judgment was taken out. The applicant now applied to have a formal judgment issued, and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report. The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time. The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour. The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure. She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy. HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report. It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report. There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time. The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old. He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court. The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program. The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report. The application was adjourned sine die returnable not sooner than 14 days after the report was received by all parties. The judgment was directed to be issued.","The applicant seeks a Voices of the Children (here a Voice of the Child as V. is the only person in issue) report to ascertain V.'s wishes and gain clarity on his best interests. HELD: A formal judgment was issued in 2012 and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. In the absence of an order varying the shared parenting order, the application is based on an alleged change of circumstances which includes V. expressing a desire to live full time with her. If a variation is not ordered at this time absent the report, the Voice of The Child report will be required to be prepared. The application is directed to have the report prepared and submitted to the parties and to the Court.  1) The affidavits are conflicting in nature and it is appropriate to ascertain whether the appropriate order is the commissioning of the report. 2) An independent assessment of her wishes with respect to her mother's proposed move back to Assiniboia and there a resumption of shared parenting arrangement will assist the Court in determining what custody and access plan is in the best interests of the applicant.  3) The parents are significantly strapped financially and as such declined to make an order allocating costs to them. It is to be borne through resources provided to the program aside from the parents.  4) The respondent opposes all relief sought."
5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","The plaintiff and defendant were involved in a lawsuit regarding the sale of three quarters of land in the Rural Municipality of Hazel Dell. Both parties agreed that the requirement of writing under the Statute of Frauds was an additional requirement to the usual essential elements of a valid contract. The plaintiff states that the offer was in writing via the exchange during the internet-based land auction and the acceptance was orally communicated via telephone conversation. The defendant states that after the bidding process closed, the plaintiff agreed to sell the land to the highest bidder respecting the Unsold Quarter. The issue was whether the agreement was created and, regardless, even if an agreement existed, it was not in writing as required by the Statutes. HELD: 1) The plaintiff must prove on a balance of probabilities that a contract was created between the plaintiff and the respondent respecting the Subject Quarters. 2) The first telephone conversation was only brief minutes, probably even seconds in duration. The second telephone conversation is all that possibly created a contract of purchase and purchase of farm property. The central issue in this lawsuit is the application by the defendant's lawyer of the statutory instrument of frauds to the land sale agreement. There are several explanations for how things went wrong in the understanding between the parties, other than the inaccurate and dishonest testimony of any of the parties. The court accepts that the plaintiff was truthful and credible witnesses. In this case, the court is not opening the door to considering evidence of what was actually going on in these men's minds.  3) By inquiring into the words used by Mr. Petrie and Mr. Labrie and the context in which those words were used, the Court is not allowing the Court to speculate that the parties were trying to create a fraudulent contract between them. The essence of the problem is the fact that the defendant clearly stated that he would not be accepting either of the packages offered. The standard of review is that of the goods and services offered, the price of the bid, the time period in which the bidding and post-bidding process took place and the amount of time it would take for the plaintiff to make a reasonable guess as to the bid bid. 4) There are numerous explanations that might explain how things turned out. However, none of these explanations can be attributed to the plaintiff."
6_1992canlii4811.txt,"During a hearing involving an application for custody contested by three parties, the trial judge heard only the appellants' evidence and the direct examination of the natural mother before calling counsel to his chambers and advising them that the hearing was a waste of time and custody should be granted to the natural mother.

He contended that the examination ordered by the Chambers judge was nothing but a duplication of the detailed and searching examinations that will be made of his assets by the trustee in the bankruptcy proceedings. The Chambers judge held that he would grant the order respecting the records respecting Fundy Associates Limited and the motor vessel with two limitations; the examination should be limited to income received by the respondent from these entities and because counsel for the respondent said that all information had been provided up to the original trial, the examination would only limited to material from that time forward.

The Act provides an elaborate and detailed complaints investigation and discipline process, with access to the courts through rights of appeal for the member being disciplined.

He took photographs of the demonstration which were seen by the public and potential patients. He also displayed signs that said Planned Parenthood would give you Aids, that were printed with words to the effect Planned Parenthood, and 'Don't let Planned Parenthood corrupt you' and 'Planned Parenthood murders innocent babies'. These facts supported the conclusion that the applicant was guilty of professional misconduct and constituted professional misconduct within the meaning of the Act.  2) The SAPLN takes the position that the Court should not entertain the application where there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act, as it is not professional. The procedure on appeal, the composition of the senate committee, its powers and the manner in which they were exercised were probably to be exercised by a body which was not a professional court of appeal and was not bound to act exactly as one nor likely to do so. 3) Costs are awarded to the applicant in the amount of $16,000."
6_2006skqb176.txt,FIAT: The respondent brings an application for a court order requiring Reginald Sauer to withdraw as solicitor for the petitioner. The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged by the respondent that confidential information was shared. The respondent also relies on the provisions of the collaborative law agreement signed by the parties. HELD: 1) The conflict in the facts was apparent and was not resolved by additional evidence. 2) Mr. Sauer agreed to withdraw as counsel so the parties may proceed to pre-trial and a trial without the necessity of a viva voce hearing.,"FIAT: The applicant brings an application for a court order requiring the solicitor to withdraw as solicitor for the complainant. The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged that Mr. Therrien alleged that confidential information was shared. The applicant submits that it would be a conflict of interest for the lawyer, who took part in the collaborative law process, to continue to represent the complainant as the issues between the parties have not been settled. HELD: The application is granted. The court ordered the withdrawal of the solicitor as counsel and the parties may proceed to a pre-trial and a trial if necessary on the issues agreed to by the parties.  1) The court accepted the applicant's admission that the only way to resolve the conflicts would be by holding a viva voce hearing. On that basis, the parties could proceed to pre- trial if needed. 2) The applicant agrees to withdraw from the role of counsel as requested in the contract. There is a dispute on the facts concerning what was discussed at the initial meeting of the parties with their lawyers. The parties agreed that both lawyers would withdraw as set out in par. 13 of the Contract. 3) As Mr. Sauer has agreed to act as counsel for Ms. Ponder, it is set for April 28, 2006."
6_2007nsca73.txt,"At the time of the deceased's death, she held a bank account jointly with her daughter. Although the signature card signed when the account was opened could not be found for the hearing, the probate court relied on the evidence of the bank representative (who testified that she had the card when she closed the account and she was 100% sure that the account was a joint account and who was able to present to the court the form of the applicable account agreement) in determining that the monies in the joint account belonged to the daughter.  It was also found, on a strong balance of probabilities, that the deceased intended to make an inter vivos gift to her daughter and, alternatively, that the evidence rebutted any presumption of resulting trust in favour of the deceased or her estate. Another of the deceased's children appealed. Appeal dismissed; the probate court judge did not misapprehend the evidence, lack an evidentiary basis for his findings, rely upon incorrect legal principles or fail to apply or misapply the law.","At issue was the ownership of monies in a joint bank account in the names of the deceased and the estate of her late mother. Over $50,000 was held on deposit in the account by the appellant and the respondents. Akerley and Gregoire served as adminstratrix of the late Mrs. Scott's estate. Their children lived in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the probate court judge did not find that any of the witnesses lacked credibility. The evidence was such that he did not have contradictory testimony before him. He focused on assessing the evidence available to the court and applying the appropriate legal principles; the standard of review applicable for all factual conclusions made by the trial judge was not palpable and overriding error."
6_2011nssc48.txt,"The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building. The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income. Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue. When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs. The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.","The plaintiff and her partner were in an apartment building when they jumped from the top floor of a building. The building was essentially a wooden structure with vinyl siding on exterior walls and asphalt roof shingles. The ceiling was completely blackened and the tenants did not have advance warning of the impending danger of smoke. The fire alarm system in the building was not functioning at the time of the fire. The plaintiff alleged that she fell while attempting to open a door on the third floor. She claimed the second floor hallway doors were always open and had a broken self-closing latch. Although there was no evidence the defendant was responsible for the fire, the plaintiff's conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire and breached the standard of care owed to the plaintiffs. HELD: Liability and damages were at issue in this case. 1) The common law duty of care arises from the proximity of the relationship between a landlord and tenants of its multi-unit residential building. In this case, the defendant owed an obligation of care to the plaintiff to ensure they were reasonably safe from injury while residing in the premises. 2) The defendant was subject to statutory obligations. The Residential Tenancies Act sets out statutory conditions that apply to all residential leases including the requirement to keep the premises in good state of repair and to comply with any statutes regarding safety. The National Fire Code of Canada (adopted by the Nova Scotia Fire Safety Act, S.N.S. 2002, c. 6) required the installation of an operational fire alarm System which must be tested yearly. Also, yearly testing of the smoke alarms was required. 3) The plaintiff's injury must fall within the ambit of the risk created by the defendant's breach."
7_1996canlii6810.txt,"An application for an interim injunction restraining the Regina Exhibition Association (REAL) from interfering with GCB's enjoyment of certain leasehold premises in the Jubilee Building and from entering into any lease with Regina Central Bingo (RCBA) and preventing the operation of a bingo hall by RCBA within Exhibition Park except as sub-tenant of GCB. The original five year lease for use of the Jubilee Building as a bingo hall between Fundraising td. and REAL was assigned to GCB with REAL's written consent. GCB further sublet the building without REAL's consent or knowledge. Written notice of renewal was not sent to REAL. The basis of GCB's application was estoppel on the basis that REAL entered negotiations regarding a relocation of the bingo hall and then began to deal directly with CGB's sub-tenant after the renewal date had passed. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)There was no evidence that Fundraisers, the original party to the lease, attempted to exercise the option to renew. 2)GCB did not have a strong prima facie case on the merits. It appeared that there were no negotiations between GCB and REAL. 3)There would not be irreparable harm. Under the current arrangements, the bingo would be operated by RCBA. If successful at trial the damages to GCB can be easily calculated based on the time it was unable to occupy the premises. 4)On balance GCB failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the inconvenience it will suffer by the refusal of the injunction will be greater than that suffered by REAL if granted.","The plaintiff applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendant from entering into any lease with the plaintiff and permitting the operation of a bingo hall by the defendant except as a tenant. The defendant had refused to renew the lease and the plaintiff had sought an injunction restraining its use of the premises. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the defendant had a strong prima facie case on the merits. It would be unfair to permit the landlord to rely on the failure to give written notice as required in the lease. The plaintiff must be able to show that an injunction until the hearing is necessary to protect him against irreparable damage and loss, mere inconvenience is not enough, and the defendant has failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the plaintiff will suffer greater than that which will be suffered if the injunction is granted."
7_1998canlii13374.txt,"Associates, which held purchase money security interests pursuant to its 1997 leases, applied under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by Associates and Humboldt Flour Mills in two reefer trailers. Humboldt's security interests were acquired pursuant to a security agreement granted in 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in 1998 to specifically include the trailers. It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly. To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.","An application for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by the parties and directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. HELD: The application was allowed. It was ordered that its purchase-money security interests in the two trailers had priority to the security interests of the respondent in them.  1)The issue to be determined was what was meant by the term 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when, in thecircumstances of this case, the Lake Air obtained possession orconstructive possession of the trailers within the meaning of the priority section.  2)The respondent was not in possession prior to December 22, 1997 through either the respondent or Mid-Canada.  3)Although each of these cases were decided under the former Act, sections 22 and 34(2) are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the concept of constructive possession which I'll refer to later in this column. 4)In the circumstances of the case before me, to deny the respondent priority over Humboldt would provide the debtor with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates whoave full value for the purchase- money security interest it gave from Lake Air. 5)The application was permitted. It is ordered that the purchase of the trailer and equipment have priority to each other's security interests.  6)It is obvious that before December 22/97 the trailers were not in the physical possession of Lake Air until it agreed to accept the debt. The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the respective trailers were delivered to it by Associates at the location and on the date set out in the lease.

He was seeking damages against the federal government for alleged abuses suffered while attending an Indian Residential School. The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property. The mother was awarded costs of the application set at $350.","The father was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $454 per month. Since the issuance of the order, the father has been unemployed by reason of health problems and, as a result, arrears of child support are constantly accruing. The parties have three children aged four to eight years. HELD: In the event the father receives a settlement in his law suit against the Government of Canada based on his claim of abuse suffered at the Indian Residential School, the first $50,000 will be paid into Court with the exception of paying any legal fees and disbursements plus taxes owing to his solicitors. The settlement proceeds will be divided equally among the parties. 1)It is not offensive to direct that the respondent's counsel, at the time of such settlement, if there is a settlement, pay monies into Court. Such an order does not impact the rights of the father's counsel but merely imposes a clerical task which is natural incident to the preservation of the asset in debate. 2)It was ordered in the case of the Indian residential school abuse that the father be restrained from disposing of any money that he has received or may receive in relation to the lawsuit without a further Order of Court. Section 8 of The Family Maintenance Act only authorizes restraining orders against those against whom a claim may be made and therefore made under s. 8. The threshold to be met in such an application was simply that the disposition or wasting of an asset would impair or defeat a claim under the Act."

The husband was in the military; the wife was a cleaner on a military base when the parties met and she changed jobs at the husband's direction. She now stated that she was unable to return to work due to health problems, including irritable bowel syndrome, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. Both parties accused the other of conduct which diminished matrimonial assets. The wife's mother had advanced the parties a considerable amount of money during the marriage, with the final advance being the subject of an IOU. The husband is to be responsible for the matrimonial debts, with the net proceeds from the sale of matrimonial home to be paid ratably to those creditors; the wife is to receive 35% of the husband's pension entitlement; husband to pay spousal support in the amount of $1,000 per month for a period of ten years with the order open to variation if the wife obtains a C.P.P. disability pension or becomes fit to work or if the husband retires from the military or makes a proposal or an assignment in bankruptcy which has the effect of requiring the wife to pay any of the matrimonial debts.","The petitioner was awarded a divorce under s. 8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. The issues were the division of matrimonial assets and liabilities, whether the petitioner is entitled to spousal support and, if so, in what quantum.HELD: The court held that the pension of one spouse was valid and that it would be unfair or unconscionable to divide the pension such as it was during the cohabitation. The respondent was entitled to an equal share of the pension credits earned prior to the marriage, but the pension should be divided equally, apart from any moral obligation he might voluntarily assume. The court found that the respondent’s contributions to the pension were reasonable and that they were not being used to support an unequal division of assets. The pension was not divided equally and the respondent was not responsible for any of the expenses herself. As some of the key terms to make this binding obligation were missing, there was no legal obligation."

The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act. The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3) The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","FIAT: The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent. The applicant asks for an order directing the Registrar of Titles to register the Plan of Proposed Subdivision with respect to Parcel G and to issue a Transform Approval Certificate. The requested relief cannot be provided unless the Court has authority to order a subdivision of land outside the requirements of the Planning and Development Act, 1983. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge erred in holding that the applicant retained a legal interest in the farm site which could form the basis of a registrable transfer under The Land Titles Act. HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1) Even if the original transaction appeared to have been concluded in an effort to avoid compliance with subdivision regulations, rather it was made in the mistaken belief that an already subdivided parcel was being transferred. 2) While the Court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders, it is not within the Court's power to order the Registrar to effect subdivision contrary to the provisions of The Improvements Under the Mistake of Title Act 1983 where such a condition existed, the Court was obliged to grant the order requested. 3) In Arndt Estate v. First Galesburg National Bank and Trust Co. Ltd. (2001), 206 Sask. R. 261 (Q.B.) (C.A.) (Attorney General) (who had purchased the land from the respondent), the respondent school division (which was to purchase the land) commenced proceedings to lapse the plaintiff's caveat to protect his interest. 4) The applicant remained on the farm property and brought an action seeking a rectification of the agreements and an order that the parties to the action apply for subdivision approval. 5) Proceedings were taken by the School Division, pursuant to subdivision approval, which the Court may be constrained from awarding on the application as framed. 6) The School Division advised that in seven years nothing has been resolved, prompting them to make this application. The Appeal Court held that at the time of the purported reservation of title in favour of the respondent, no subdivision of agricultural land was permitted in respect of an area less than five acres. The respondent sought to reserve two acres only. subdivision would therefore not have been permitted, if applied for. 7) The application in question was tantamount to a judicially ordered partition of land to avoid the effect of legislation."

An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms. This decision has not been implemented. At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The applicant is such a student. His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended. The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding. The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts. 2) The applicant is entitled to relief. The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met. The applicant must enter into a written agreement with the College of Medicine whereby he agrees that the money he was paid while on suspension is prepayment for all of the services he will perform for the College of Medicine in the remainder of his residency, that he will not claim any salary or monetary benefits available to other medical residents pursuant to the PAIRS agreement, and he will indemnify the College of Medicine if it is required to make payments to him pursuant to the PAIRS agreement during the remainder of his residency program. Further, PAIRS will enter into an agreement with the College of Medicine waiving the financial terms of the PAIRS agreement with respect to the applicant for the duration of his residency. 3) The applicant will be responsible for paying tuition fees, administration fees, insurance fees and any other college fees payable by other medical residents but he will be granted a credit for the fees deducted by the College of Medicine during the time he was suspended.","At issue was a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The policy states that in order for a student to return to the college of medicine he must acquire third party funding. This funding was depleted during the period of suspension. The student insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. HELD: There is no dispute on the facts. Both parties relied on the record developed in earlier proceedings. In the context in which the question arises, and the object and purpose of the policy, the exclusivity of the jurisdiction extends to judging that the university satisfy standards that are fundamental to the administration of justice in every sphere. It is important to maintain the integrity of the college's supernumerary resident policy, and to avoid what it perceives to be potential problems with other government agencies, and potential financial implications for itself, if it should make an exception. The fact that the student had not yet exhausted his appeals within the internal laws of the University, and specifically to the Council of Student Appeals and Academic Matters, suggests that systemic forces were at work beyond the student's control."
7_2006nspc61.txt,"A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference. The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","The accused appeared before the Youth Court and entered or confirmed guilty pleas to 31 offences involving assaultive behaviour, threats, property damage and breach of court orders in relation to group home placements over a 14 month period between 2005 and 2006. The accused applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from a pre-sentencing conference held to consider recommendations on a youth sentence. The Crown and the accused sought a ruling from the court as to whether the public, including the media, should be permitted to attend the conference. HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the conference be held prior to the sentencing hearing.  1) Conferencing is new tool under the Youth Criminal Justice Act. It can be used in a variety of ways. 2) It must be made clear at the outset that the request for an exclusion order relates only to the conference itself. The purpose of the conference is to give advice and provide recommendations on sentencing, which also is part of the court process.  3) In this case, the court found that the interests of society in the protection and rehabilitation of young people involved in youth court proceedings is a value of such superordinate importance that it justifies the discretion given to a youth court judge under s. 39(1)(a) of the Young Offenders Act. The legislation attempts to protect the privacy interests through the non-publication provisions, the restrictions on access to records and judicial discretion to exclude members of the public from proceedings if such exclusion is necessary to prevent serious risk to the proper administration of justice."

At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff. The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.","The plaintiff, a cousin of the deceased, commenced an action to recover damages for nervous shock after being hit from behind by a motor vehicle.

The landlord claims it is a security deposit. 3) The tenants claim they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arrears were accepted on that basis. 4) The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's appeal the same day saying 'the rent for August has not been paid and not paid by required time, appeal is dismissed'. 5) The first issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in finding the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make the order granting possession on the basis that 'the rent was 15 days in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice' if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession. The second issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid.","The tenants applied for leave to appeal a Queen's Bench decision reviewing a decision of the Deputy Rentalsman granting an order of possession and issuing a writ of possession. Their reasons were that the rent was 15 days or more in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy was served and the tenant had failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice. HELD: Application allowed. 1) The tenants had until 4:00 p.m. on August 31, 2006 to serve and file their appeal book and factum. 2) The Chambers judge did not err in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid. 3) There was no order as to costs."

The applicant seeks both a variation and rescission of arrears which have accumulated under the original support order. HELD: 1) The applicant has established the necessary change in circumstance, namely the introduction of the Guidelines. Based on the applicant's income, his child support payment is reduced from $500 per month to $425 per month.  2) The applicant is in arrears in the amount of $56,365.60. He has provided little explanation for his failure to pay the child support he was ordered to pay other than he was stubborn. It is apparent that he had the ability to pay. The application for rescission for arrears is dismissed.","FIAT: The applicant applies pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a variation of support for the parties' one child, Desiree May Braun-McLaughlan, born February 14, 1992. Mr. McLaughlan seeks both a variation in regard to his ongoing child support payments as well as rescission of arrears which have accumulated under the original child support order. HELD: 1) The respondent resides in British Columbia and the applicant is in Saskatchewan. The respondent was served with this motion in October 2006. Given that the respondent is currently earning the sum of $45,784 per year, he can afford to pay a reasonable payment towards the outstanding arreaars. 2) The applicant appears to be suggesting that his payment of ongoing support, and any payment he must make towards arrear, leaves him in financial difficulties, given he has remarried and has two more children. However, in order to allow the rescission application to proceed, would have to determine that he has, firstly, present inability to pay and secondly, that he will not in the future be able to pay. 3) The Court dismissed the respondent's application for rescission. It is in the appellant's best interests that his income be set out above. He is earning a reasonable sum. The Court found that it is reasonable to adjust the child support payment as at November 1, 2006 given the amount he is earning and given the fact that he is currently making. 4) Given the respondent has been earning the amount of $44,784 (per year) and the fact the original order was made pursuant to provincial as opposed to federal legislation, the appellant has established the necessary change in circumstance, namely, the introduction of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. 5) The appellant has provided income tax summaries reflecting his income for the years from 1995 through to 2004. He swore a financial statement on February 15, 2006 wherein he set out his current earnings. Based on these earnings, the Appellant has an obligation, according to the British Columbia Tables, to pay $425 for the one child. The applicant is entitled to vary based on his income at any time."
7_2007skqb28.txt,"The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over.08 contrary to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The Crown appealed the acquittal. The accused was locked in his vehicle for 17 minutes while the RCMP conducted a search at the side of the road. During this time, the officer noted an odour of alcohol from the accused and made a roadside screening demand which resulted in a 'fail' reading. The officer testified that he thought the accused's face was flushed, another of the common signs of consumption of alcohol. HELD: The Court held that the delay of 17 minutes from when the police should have made the demand but did not and detained Shire in the locked police vehicle while he was detained, without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of Shire’s Charter rights. The evidence obtained following the breach of his Charter rights is conscriptive evidence. The Court found that the officer ought to have had a reasonable suspicion of impaired driving and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. However, what the officer chose to do was have Shire wait in the police vehicle because the search was being conducted at the roadside and he could not exit. It took further 17 minutes for the vehicle search and before any demand was made Shire was taken to Carlyle detachment where he provided two samples of breath, both of which were 120 mgs. Although a travel mug was found during the course of the search and after Shire had been placed in the vehicle, there was no further delay as a result of the 17 minutes delay, the evidence obtained from the subsequent breathalyser test was excluded under s. 24(2)."
7_2015skqb216.txt,"Civil Procedure – ContemptCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 11-16Municipal Law – Zoning Bylaw – Enforcement The applicant rural municipality was granted an order in May 2014 by a Queen’s Bench judge that directed the respondent to comply within 60 days with an order of the applicant’s development officer. That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","The respondent is the owner of land located within the Rural Municipality of Edenwold No. 158. It was granted an order pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act, 2007, SS 2007, P-13.2 that required the respondent to comply with the orders made pursuant to the 2014 Order. The respondent took no significant steps to comply and, despite numerous court appearances and preparation of two memoranda and several affidavits, continued to use his land as a storage yard despite the court order requiring him to remove all of the offending equipment. The court found that this was not a case of the respondent having acted in high-handed manner either before or after the order. Rather, it was a situation that required a complete or near complete indemnification for costs reasonably incurred by the respondent. The Court awarded the respondent $15,000.00 in contempt of court costs, which included $5,000 in fines and solicitor/client costs, and added $10,000 to the respondent’s solicitor and client costs. The contempt application was adjourned to February 2, 2015, being the next closest date after the court ordered by the Development Officer. Costs of the contempt application were also increased by the amount of time requested by the applicant to be spent on preparing an affidavit. The applicant requested further legal fees and disbursements to be paid in accordance with the order and requested further adjournments to allow him to complete the purging of his contempt proceedings. HELD: The court held that the contempt proceedings were not for punishment per se but for upholding the rule of law and respect for court orders.  1)Saskatchewan Court of Appeal Rule 11-1(1)(a) provides for solicitor-client costs in exceptional circumstances including but not restricted to situations where the conduct of the party against whom they are awarded is scandalous, outrageous or reprehensible. It is also the means by which the RM has obtained authority, if necessary, to remedy the contravention of the Zoning Bylaw.  2)The respondent was awarded significant costs and added to the tax rolls for Parcel A and B and became liable if he did not purge his contempt within the time allotted by the Court. He will also be responsible for his own legal fees. 3)The court was concerned that any additional financial sanction may be more akin to punishment and may cause severe hardship to the appellant."
7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","The defendant was found guilty of the second degree murder of his common law spouse following a trial before a judge and jury. The trial judge sought input from counsel as to whether a Vetrovec warning should be given in relation to the testimony of Ms. Saxon and her friend, Dwight Windrum. The defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; defendant given no reasons for his decision not to give the warning.  1) The exchange between the trial judge and counsel for the Crown and defence at the time of the pre-charge conference was an important factor in determining whether the defendant should have given a warning. 2) The defendant admitted that he asked the plaintiff to change the barrel of the handgun. He told the plaintiff that he intended to sell the handgun to a friend of his. Windrum did not testify at the trial and his testimony was not accepted by the jury.  3) In assessing the credibility of an impugned witness, a trial judge must give prominence to two factors: credibility and the importance of the witness's evidence to the Crown’s case. A discretionary decision warrants appellate intervention only if the judge has a fundamental misunderstanding of the strength of the ballistic and scientific evidence. The scientific evidence did not, contrary to the submissions of Mr. Healey, support the version of events given by Susan Saxon. The plaintiff was awarded life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for 12 years. The court found that the defendant fell into error in failing to give proper direction to the plaintiff regarding the use of a drug that could be used to assist in the identification of a person who posed a threat to the public or to provide evidence of a motive to lie under oath. 4) The evidence implicating the defendant in the murder did not rise to the level of suspicion or alarm that it might be harmful to the accused if a dose of the drug was given in tandem with the evidence at the scene."

The police officer had responded to a call in connection with a disturbance during which the appellant assaulted a third person. Upon arriving at the scene the officer recognised the appellant as someone wanted by the police. The officer told the appellant that he was under arrest because of two outstanding warrants. The appellant assaulted the officer. The officer did not give evidence as to the grounds for his belief that the warrants met the s. 495(1)(c) Criminal Code requirement, i.e., that they were in a format set out in Part XXVIII and in force within the jurisdiction. In his charge to the jury the trial judge indicated that the arrest was for the assault against the third party and did not direct the jury to consider if the officer had reasonable grounds for believing that there were warrants outstanding. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the officer arrested the appellant for the assault on the third party and it was not made clear to the jury that they must make an essential determination if the officer had reasonable grounds as required in s. 495 of the Code, such that he was acting in the execution of his duty.","The appellant appealed his conviction following a trial in the Supreme Court before a jury on a charge that he did assault a police officer engaged in the execution of his duties contrary to s. 270(2)(a) of the Criminal Code. The police had responded to a disturbance call and found a person who was wanted by the police. When asked his name, the officer gave a fictitious one. The officer arrested the appellant and arrested him on a warrant for assault causing bodily harm. The appellant testified that the warrant was for an assault on the police officer and that he knew that there were outstanding warrants for his arrest. The Crown appealed the conviction and sought new trial. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge mischaracterized the officer's Charter rights to counsel and police warning as being an essential ingredient of the offence charged that the assault take place while the officer was exercising some power or performing some duty imposed on him either by common law or statute."

The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing, that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record. In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial. As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","The respondent hotel manager appealed three orders of the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia) ordering her to reinstate the individual respondents, to pay them compensation, and to refuse to reconsider the first two orders. Other respondents were Hotel Employees Restaurant Employees Union, Local 662, hotel staff, and the respondent Attorney General. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for a rehearing, that the Board is not bound by legislation to provide reasons for decisions.

As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.","The petitioner seeks an interim order setting his ongoing child support obligation as well as addressing the arrears. The parties subsequently entered into an agreement whereby the parties agreed the $300 per month would be greater than their legal obligation. Arrears have accumulated and he seeks to expunge them. The petitioner is part of a family farm operation. He supplements his farm income with working for part of the season at a local sporting store. This generates some rental income. The respondent takes the position that the petitioner's line 150 income does not reflect his ability to pay and that by reporting a farm loss each year the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay.

In the absence of something further, the court is not prepared to impute income. 2) The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. 3) The court is cognizant of the fact the payor agreed to pay $300.00 per month non-taxable in 1992. He did nothing to change this obligation in all of the intervening years.  4) The $300 is an unexplained amount of money sitting in the Maintenance Enforcement Office as result of a federal intercept.

8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch and filed with the Court of Queen's Bench. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The certificate is properly issued as permitted by s. 62 of The Labour Standards Act. 2) The Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a true appeal that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Further, the reasoning of the Court in Farmers of North America is not applicable to these circumstances. A finding that the Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. 3) The principles and the rules that flow from them and which have developed in relation to the opening up of noting for default and in setting aside default judgments are much different. There is no independent evidentiary based finding that there is an enforceable judgment if the proper steps to dispute it are not taken within the specified period of time. 4) The applicant either declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language on the document. This, at the very least, amounts to wilful blindness. The consequences for inaction parallel those of a defendant who is noted for default as a result of his failure to file a statement of defence within the prescribed time frame."

Appeal dismissed.","An appeal pursuant to s. 72 of The Residential Tenancies Act from a decision of a hearing officer appointed under the Act who, pursuant to ss. 58, 68 and 70 of the Act, ordered that the landlord be given possession of the tenant's rental unit and that a writ of possession be issued to place the landlord in possession. The grounds for the application were that the tenant had unreasonably disturbed other tenants within the meaning of ss. 68(2)(a)(i) and 68(1)(i). HELD: The material available for review is limited to the notice of appeal from the hearing officer filed by the appellant, the documents by the Hearing Officer and the decision of the Hearing officer. The court is restricted to addressing questions of law or jurisdiction. In this type of appeal, the court may not revisit the questions or issues of fact determined by the hearing officers. There must be some relevant evidence to support a finding of fact, that finding may not be disturbed on appeal. Only when there is not relevant supporting evidence is the line between a valid non-appealable finding and an invalid appealable finding crossed."
8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking. He was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused's pre-sentence reports filed show that he had a less active role and he did not smash windows, inflict blows or inflict any blows. He had acted in threatening manner and held in his possession bear spray. HELD: The Court found that the predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Code. The Court ordered that the accused be convicted of the first two mos. of his secure custody disposition in open custody and that he should be sentenced to a term not exceeding fourteen years. The sentences were concurrent as an adult with a concurrent sentence of 25 months custody and supervision followed by 2 months open custody followed by 7 months supervision in the community. 1) Given the conviction and Criminal Code provisions for imprisonment, the Court was satisfied the predicate offences were serious personal injuries offences. 2) The accused had a long record of violent behaviour. The offences occurred when he was between the ages of fifteen and twenty-three. He lived on the Beardy's Reserve with an uncle. The uncle was a notorious street gangster. There was no indication of violence to others in the area."
8_2015skqb6.txt,"HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation. The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge. All accused were given an 18-month probation period to follow their incarceration. Terms of the probation included counselling as required and no contact with the victim.","HELD: The Court sentenced the three accused pursuant to s. 267(b) and s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for breaking and entering and committing the offence of assault causing bodily harm on December 28, 2011. The Court found that the three had consented to the use of a roofing hammer and that they had discussed confronting the victim after night of drinking. The victim, who had recently graduated from high school, was not exposed to family violence or the abuse of drugs or alcohol. The three accused admitted to the offence and gave a statement to the police shortly after his arrest. The Crown sought a DNA order, a firearms prohibition and a forfeiture order in relation to the imitation firearm. HELD: A four year sentence was appropriate with a slightly lesser sentence for Mr. Foster on the break and enter. The accused would face a sentence of one year to 18 months. The court found that denunciation and deterrence are the most important principles in sentencing and the accused should not be excused for their actions as a result of the accused's potential fraud on them. Vigilante justice cannot be countenanced in the circumstances."
8_2016skqb154.txt,"HELD: The order was granted. Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","The Ministry sought a permanent wardship order with respect to two children. The parents of the children, despite being more or less involved with the proceedings for some of the period since the action was commenced, did not appear for the trial of the action. HELD: The Court found the children to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry presented its evidence completely and provided a full and complete argument in support of its recommendation in this matter. Counsel for the children participated fully in the trial process and presented argument in advocating for the interests of these children. Decisions like this one are life-changing for so many people. The children have proven resilient, the parents are engaged with the criminal justice system, the father is involved in serious matters, the children have been exposed to harmful interaction for sexual purpose and the father has been absent from the children's lives for the past three years. The Court concluded that good intentions by themselves were not sufficient to enable the father to continue to abuse these children and that his failure to take measurable steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues would result in the children suffering physical harm at the hands of their father."
9_1997canlii9803.txt,"The respondents applied for a declaration that the intensive livestock operation being constructed by Kelvington (KSS) was a development pursuant to s2(d) of the Environmental Assessment Act (EAA) and sought an order for mandamus compelling KSS to conduct an environmental assessment as required by s9 of the EAA. Yellow Quill First Nation applied for intervenor status. The trial judge found, without giving reasons, that the project was a development as defined in the Environmental Assessment Act and the application for mandamus was adjourned sine die. HELD: The appeal was granted and the order set aside without costs. 1)The proposal was not a development as defined in s 2(d) of the EAA. The Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment and Resource Management were of the opinion that the KSS project was not a development as defined in the Act as it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s2(d). 2)The Environmental Assessment Branch was of the opinion that no significant impacts on the environment would occur or if they do, mitigation measures would be implemented to reduce or eliminate the potential for significant environmental impact.  3)It was not necessary to decide whether Yellow Quill or the respondents had standing to privately enforce a public right. 4)In light of the decision the following were not in issue: whether the respondent should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari; the relationship between the Environmental Assessment and Agricultural Operations Act; and whether a proponent of an intensive livestock operation can be required to make an application under the Agricultural Operations Act and to carry out an environmental impact assessment under s9 of the EAA.","The respondents applied to the Court of Queen's Bench by notice of motion for a declaration that the intensive livestock operation being constructed by the Kelvington Super Swine Inc. (KSS) was a development pursuant to s. 2(d) of The Environmental Assessment Act. The second issue on appeal was whether the respondents should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari to set aside the order of the Minister of Agriculture as opposed to applying for declaration. The order was set aside without costs. HELD: The appeal was granted with costs to the respondents. 1)The Court found that the proposal was not a development as defined by the Environmental Assessment act because it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s. 9 of the Act.  2)The majority of the facts deposed to in those affidavits were based on information and belief. 3)There was no disagreement on the essential underlying facts. 4)The affidavit evidence filed on behalf of the appellant and the respondents were in breach of the Rule and those portions may not be considered. 5)The respondent did not seek costs. 6)The court did not permit the use of affidavits taken at their highest probative value. The affidavits did not prove on the requisite standard of proof that the KSS project was development. 7)It was not necessary to consider the application of HL Pork Producers Ltd. requesting intervenor status. 8)The KSS application was granted. 9)The second issue was whether there was a need for wider public consultation as the applicant had already spent time preparing the affidavit evidence and preparation for the application which was to be heard on the return date of the appeal. 10)The issues were determined to be the effect of the legislation on the applicant's ability to enforce a fundamental right to rely on evidence as a result of the passage of time. 11)Costs were awarded to the respondent in respect to the cost of preparing the affidavits. 12)The amount of time it would take the applicant to complete the environmental assessment was $10,000. The court was not required to consider whether the respondent or the respondents had standing to privately enforce a public right. 15)The respondents were awarded costs."
9_2006nssc379.txt,"The Minister sought numerous orders for production of medical and various other files (including the mother's complete medical files from her family physician, the Nova Scotia Hospital and another hospital, and her files from a woman's shelter and an addiction treatment and prevention service) in an ongoing child protection proceeding. The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","The applicant sought 13 Orders of Production for documents prepared by and in the possession of her service providers. The Minister was requesting the records to determine whether there were other circumstances in the applicant's life that would place the child in need of protection. The applicant argued that this threshold was inappropriate for proceedings commenced pursuant to the Children and Family Services Act. This threshold was established for civil proceedings in which the records sought are often well-defined and generally narrow in scope. This information is relevant to the preparation of the parental capacity assessment. HELD: The application of Rule 69 is dismissed. The court is not satisfied that the production of all of the orders of production requested will save costs. The higher standard used in criminal proceedings to determine relevancy should apply to child protection proceedings. The nature of these proceedings have very serious consequences for parents and for their children and demand a heightened concern for accuracy in fact finding. The criteria for the claim of privilege based on confidentiality are those set forth in Wigmore on Evidence, vol. (McNaughton rev. 1961), and the Supreme Court confirmed that this term has not been defined in Rule 69. The purpose of our Civil Procedure Rules is to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every proceeding. To achieve this purpose, applicants must be clearly identified by providing the linkage between the information sought and the issues in dispute and must be collected by selecting means specifically tailored to produce the relevant information. This may place a greater burden on the service provider than does merely copying all of its files."

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care. HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period. JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court. This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs. The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. 3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time. KS has quit drinking. TK is now employed. KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction. The parents have a residence. TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health. DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time. TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children. The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser. The success of the involvement of DCR in the life of this family would be enhanced with the assignment of another worker.","The Department of Community Resources seeks orders pursuant to The Child and Family Services Act placing the respondent with the Department until age 18 and placing the child with his grandmother as a Person of Sufficient Interest pursuant to s. 37(1)(b).

He was in agreement that he would not voluntarily discharge himself. The parties agreed that the Court would provide a release so that the Department could obtain information about the child's treatment with respect to that child. 8) The Court found that the parties agreed to terms and conditions of the agreement as provided in the Act. The child was to remain with the respondent until his 16th birthday, which was granted at the trial. 9) The matter was to be reviewed in September 2005 and the trial date was to continue until the completion of the trial in May 2006. 10) The petitioner is to provide 60 days' notice of the application to the Court and if the Court determines that it has not satisfied the Court's expectations of the child, the order shall terminate after the expiry of the period, not exceeding one year, specified in the order.

9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","Dr. Huerto commenced an action in Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts for medical services provided by the Government of Saskatchewan. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 accounts. The appellant appealed from that judgment. Appeal dismissed; cross-appeal dismissed. The aspects of the Protocol that allow the Government to request more information about the services underpinning an account are invalid because they amount to an attempt to regulate his pattern of practice. The Protocol is an individualized administrative process and the aspects which deal with the AU code are designed to facilitate the payment of an account and, in appropriate situations, to deny payment. Such matters can only be addressed through a JMPRC established pursuant to s. 49.2 of the MCIA. HELD: Both the appeal and the appeal must be dismissed. 1) The principles of the payment schedule are outlined in the Physician Payment Schedule (PPS) referenced in s. 3(d) and 6(1)(d) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Payment Regulations. 2) The payment schedule allows the Government in at least some circumstances (perhaps in the summer or fall of 1994) to request further information concerning the particular service provided to a specific patient. It does not deny payment for that service. In the case of the 16 accounts, the physician chose not to respond to the Government's requests for further information. As a practical consequence of that decision, he received no payment for the services in issue. His claim for reimbursement was dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. 3) The large majority of the physician's claims are barred because they were not submitted within 6 months of the date the services were provided. The trial judge should have declined jurisdiction because the physician failed to take advantage of the internal appeal procedures available to physicians dissatisfied with the Government’s assessment of their accounts.  4) The Protocol ties directly into the “Assessment Rules” portion of the Payment Schedule. It states that accounts may be adjusted with reference to the relationship between the service being billed and prior or subsequent services and in addition to the submission of claims for related services. In this case, a significant number of the accounts were marked with the code in accordance with the provisions of that agreement.  5) The standard procedure, which are at the heart of the appeal, is standard tests and not 'unusual’ in and of themselves."
9_2009nsca91.txt,"The young person appealed his sentence on an aggravated assault conviction following a drive-by shooting and applied for release pending appeal. Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school. Application for release pending appeal dismissed. The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","The victim of a drive-by shooting appealed his sentence of 365 days, comprised of 243 days custody followed by 122 days supervision in the community. Prior to being remanded, the victim had been asked to leave the high school he had previously attended as a result of concern for his and other students' safety after threats had been made against him.

He had been convicted of five breaches of probation, two breaches of undertaking, and two resisting arrest/obstruction charges. He was sentenced to a total of 21 months custody, 4 months of which is non-custodial. Application for release pending appeal dismissed; the accused will suffer unnecessary hardship if released pending appeal. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault offence, his record of violent offences, and numerous breaches of court orders, releasing the accused from custody pending appeal would not be in the public interest.

HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters.

The defendants were ordered to pay $30,000 as real, net loss of future income. The court approved a 5% capitalization rate as being appropriate where there was an eight year term to age 65. The plaintiff settled his future Section B benefits just before trial. The court rejected the defence argument that they were entitled to a credit for present value of those benefits which represented a figure over seven times the settlement figure. The defendants were only entitled to a credit for sums actually paid to the plaintiff. The court rejected the plaintiff's actuarial report as being late and in breach of Civil Procedure Rule 31.08.","The plaintiff was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident. His automobile was struck from behind. He was driving. His wife was front seat passenger. Awarding him $140,000 in general damages, that his injuries were so severe that he could not walk. The plaintiff was completely and permanently disabled for any type of employment, except for logging, which he was to do in the fall. The claim for pecuniary damages was dismissed. The court accepted the plaintiff's claim for loss of future income and that of his family. It was not enough for the plaintiff to urge that leave be granted because defence counsel was sufficiently skilled, prepared and experienced to deal with its late introduction. Fairness and predictability demand that the Rule be applied strictly and fairly to all sides, save in exceptional circumstances. The defendant admitted liability for the loss of pre-tax income resulting from the injuries from the date of the accident until the present time."
a_1995canlii4315.txt,"The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while impaired. His conviction was upheld on appeal to a summary conviction appeal court. This appeal was based on the argument the provincial court judge's decision failed to provide reasons for accepting the evidence of various witnesses, failed to make findings of credibility with respect to witnesses, and failed to comment on the credibility and evidence of the witnesses. The appellant complained the judge did not provide adequate reasons for the decision. Dismissing the appeal, that the decision was supported by the evidence. The court referred to R. v. Burns, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656 at 664, where the Supreme Court of Canada held that if trial judges state their conclusions in brief, and these conclusions are supported by the evidence, the verdict should not be overturned merely because they fail to discuss collateral aspects of the case.","The appellant appealed his conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drug. The Provincial Court Judge had reserved his decision and then found him guilty. Summary Conviction Appeal Court Justice Charles E. Haliburton dismissed the appeal. The appellant now sought leave to appeal and appeals that latter decision. At issue was whether the trial judge erred in law by entering a conviction when the form of Information before the Court was not bilingual in form contrary to s. 841(3). The only fact which could possibly be in issue was the actual knowledge of the appellant that consuming liquor in combination with the sedative Librex 'could possibly have an unexpected impact, an impact which, according to the evidence the Defence produced, was unknown to his own doctor except on a speculative basis. The appeal was without merit."

The union had alleged the employer violated the collective agreement by the way positions for the rank of lieutenant were filled in the fire department two years prior. As a result of the arbitration award, several lieutenants were demoted to the rank of firefighter. Denying the stay, that (1) there was no arguable issue to be tried on appeal; (2) there was no evidence the applicants would suffer irreparable harm if the stay were not granted; (3) the balance of convenience weighed against the applicants; and (4) there were no exceptional circumstances.","The applicants filed an application for an order setting aside an arbitration award made by the employer. The union alleged that the employer violated Article 23.01 of the collective agreement by the manner in which the promotion of lieutenants in the Halifax fire department was conducted. The employer sought to use inexperienced personnel in an acting capacity until a new routine was devised. The grievance arose through arbitration pursuant to a collective agreement between the parties and the union alleges the employer conducted a promotional routine for the positions of lieutenant and captain every two years. The applicants sought to have the arbitrator's award set aside. Awarding the award of the 1989 captain's promotional routine $2,500.00 per annum, that the number that is immediately adversely affected is much smaller and will be primarily the seven who are demoted who are now from time to time acting lieutenantants. The concern with respect to using inexperienced personnel has dissipated if not entirely disappeared, at least in the short run. Those who have been demoted do suffer the loss of uniform rank and some loss of pay. On the issue of costs, the union's position that the fundamental issue raised by the grievance was not changeable but that it was one of several issues which could result in a bigger mess if the city pursues its own agenda."

Appeal dismissed,"The appeal from 1992 CanLII 7943 (SK QB), [1992] 6 W.W.R. 116) must be dismissed. There is some confusion as to the answers he gave to the questions posed in his judgment. In an addendum, he said the answer to question should be no. It seems clear that he was referring to question 5, rather than question 4. The result is the same. The case was put to the court below prematurely, with the result that it was put on what was essentially a hypothetical basis, and Charter decisions should not be made without sufficient factual base. There was no evidence put before the court that the appellants or any of them had yet suffered any adverse consequences as result of the impugned legislation, although proceedings were pending before the Labour Relations Board which might result in adverse consequences. More particularly, no evidence that anyone had lost their job or had been in any way penalized for refusing to either pay union dues or to join the union, nor was there any evidence as to why anyone objected to being a member of the bargaining unit in question or the union in question so as to permit any reasoned decision regarding the alleged right not to associate."

Finding the defendant solely at fault, that evidence from the accident reconstruction as to the angle of impact supported a conclusion the defendant was travelling faster than she realized and was inattentive. Damages were set as follows: impairment to hearing in left ear assessed at $8500, damage to left knee assessed at $2500. Exacerbation of a pre-existing back condition which produced consequences in the severe range was assessed at $31,500.","The plaintiff suffered a concussion, hearing loss in his left ear, neck injury and knee injuries when he was hit from behind by a motor vehicle. The flare-ups of pain since the motor vehicle accident had been more severe than those prior to the accident. The onus is on the plaintiff to establish negligence.

The fact that any payment to the unsecured creditors is dependant upon successful negotiations with the Bank of Montreal, Prairie Security fund and an outside investor means the proposal is effectively nothing more than a 'holding proposal'. 4)The criteria to be followed by the Court on an application of this nature is set out in ss.59(2). 5)The Court was not prepared to withhold approval of the proposal on this basis."

Supplementary reasons should not be written without a request from the Court of Appeal.","The accused was charged with three counts under the Criminal Code under the unlawful assault against a peace officer and unlawful resisting a police officer. He was acquitted on all charges. The accused appealed his conviction on the grounds that the trial judge based her decision on considerations which were not supported in the evidence.

b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","An appeal from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend after a motor vehicle accident occurred. At the time of the accident, McLeod was on company business and was driving his wife's Honda because his company car had a deflated tire. At issue was whether the chambers judge erred in his determination of which insurer was obligated to defend and if so, in his application of the principles of contract interpretation. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No matter the scope of the inquiry the duty to defend does not arise because the policy is ambiguous. The chambers judge determined the policy did not provide coverage for that which was alleged in the pleadings. 2)The chambers judge did not have the factual basis before him to support his interpretation of the policy and form his conclusions. 3)In any event, where a claim alleges state of facts which, if proven, would fall within the coverage of a policy, the insurer has no duty toDefend. 4)The Court reviewed the case law and the tenor of the Nichols decision. It concluded that a duty of defending arises only when the claim alleges exclusivity and is clearly not supported by the policy. In this case, the respondent was the primary insurer as the holder of the blanket fleet coverage of the respondent. 5)A more restricted inquiry on s.209(1) could reduce the potential for inconsistent judgments created by the operation of s. 209(2) and s.207(3)."

There were numerous adverse impacts on the victim. 2)Mitigating circumstances included the absence of a criminal record; his abstinence from alcohol since the assault; the absence of penile penetration; his remorse and apology to the victim and to the court; his serious health problems; his ability to rehabilitate and the fact that he was a model citizen prior to the assault.",The accused was convicted of sexual assault. The Crown sought a sentence of 1/2 to 3 years for a sexual assault where there was no prior romantic connection between the victim and the accused and claimed the property damage and vandalism had nothing to do with the offence. HELD: A sentence of 18 months in a provincial correctional centre was justified. A three year sentence was to be increased or decreased from the three year term based on the circumstances of the individual case. A lengthy sentence will seriously affect the accused's ability to rehabilitate. A sentence other than a custodial sentence would not meet the fundamental principle referred to in s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code which permits the accused to serve his term in the community.

The appellant and the respondent had been equal shareholders in a company that incorporated Gorbin. The allegation was that the appellant placed a second mortgage on a property owned by the company without the Gordon's knowledge or consent. Gorbin's shareholder's resolutions and banking resolutions required the signatures of both Gordon and the appellant on legal documents and cheques. The applicant first became aware of the mortgage in 1982 when it was foreclosed upon. In August 1995 the appellant initiated this action against the respondent banks. The respondents applied under Civil Procedure Rule 14.25(a), to strike the statement of claim on the basis that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action or, alternatively, to strike it as being barred by the Limitation of Actions Act. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal allowed per oral reasons of Bateman, J.A.; Hallett and Freeman, JJ.A. concurring.

The father was granted access two weekends out of every three and additional time as they may agree upon. Although both were very good parents the parties had not demonstrated an ability to co-parent effectively as illustrated by their communication problems.

The paternal grandparents were responsible individuals who had genuine affection and concern for the child.

Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.","The accused, who was committed to stand trial on one of the fraud charges, applied for a remedy pursuant to s. 24 of the Charter. HELD: The application was based primarily on the accused's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time.  1) The length of delay in the preliminary hearing was 8.5 months. 2) The amount of delay was sufficient to warrant an adjournment. 3) The time period to be considered is the period of time from the charge to the trial. 4) The Court found no particular reason for the delay. 5) The delay was substantial and sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay.  6) In R. v. Morin, [1992] S.C.R. 771, the Supreme Court of Canada set out the factors it should consider in determining whether delay has been unreasonable. They are: 1) There was a substantial volume of material that had not yet been disclosed to the accused. The accused has been extremely active politically. He was elected chief of the Cote First Nation in 1996. He won by a tie-breaking vote. The validity of the election was challenged and he was unable to participate in the 1998 election. The outstanding charges had clearly prevented him from maintaining his previously active participation in band politics. 7) The accused will have endured an unnecessary additional 9 months of unemployment, economic hardship and other prejudice in the form of prejudice. He will have to call evidence if he is to displace the strong public interest in bringing those charged with criminal offences to trial."
b_2000skqb420.txt,"FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty. In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt. His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","FIAT. The defendant represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation (SCIC). The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed resulted from the actions of SCIC. The plaintiff's officer was employed by the farmers on a contingency basis, the understanding being that the clients would pay the defendant's disbursements in any event. When the plaintiff commenced its action under the General Rules (Part Forty), it became more and more worried about how it would be paid and the outcome of the litigation. One of the farmers, Greba, paid a deposit to the defendant for remittance to the plaintiff as down payment on the latter's fees. In the alternative, the plaintiff brought an application pursuant to Rule 483 for summary judgment under Rule 488 (Simplified Procedure) which it did without objection. HELD: The portions of the affidavit were struck as hearsay and opinion. The addition of the word protect puts the question beyond doubt.  1) The only conclusion that can be drawn from the facts is that the respondent guaranteed the payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcomes of their mutual client's actions. 2) The Court was not awarded judgment for the amount of its claim, interest as provided for in the undertaking and costs of the action."
b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant. However, neither the accused nor the complainant, due to their respective self-induced states of intoxication, had any memory of the sexual intercourse. HELD: The accused was acquitted. 1) The Court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self- induced intoxication. The Court must assess the capacity of the witness to accurately recall and relate to events that occurred before, during and immediately after the alleged assault. 2) In sexual assault cases, the defence of 'extreme drunkenness' is successful in the rarest of cases. The accused contends that at the time he was assaulted, he was so intoxicated that he was not in conscious state and was incapable of forming any reasonable belief that the complainant was consenting. 3) In a case like the one before me, the Court was unable to understand how someone who was so grossly intoxicated could be capable of having sexual intercourse that involved penetrating the complainant and ejaculating semen into her vagina. There was no evidence tendered at the trial that was inconsistent with the accused's testimony. Neither was there anything inconsistent with his evidence as to the state of his intoxication."
b_2002skqb131.txt,"The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","The summary conviction appeal by the Crown was brought when the trial judge dismissed charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08 percent. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of 'autrefois acquit' and that the manner of the Crown's proceeding was an abuse of process at common law. HELD: 1)The trial judge erred in law in finding that the court had lost jurisdiction as he specifically found that if there was loss of jurisdiction it was over the offence. The special plea by the respondent was based solely on the deemed dismissal for want of prosecution in Alberta.  2)The Court was unable to agree that an appearance in a Saskatchewan court as a result of a summons issued before May 7, 2001 revived jurisdiction over the respondent. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for wants of prosecution on May 6, 2001.  3)The Saskatchewan court did not lose jurisdiction when nothing happened in March/April 2001 and the subsequent appearance in May/March 2001. The jurisdiction was regained by following the procedure set out in s. 485.1 of the Code. 4)When jurisdiction was lost in Alberta, it gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquitted. 5)The special plea was not available in the circumstances of this case. 6)An appeal of the decision by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal was dismissed."
b_2002skqb250.txt,"FIAT. Saskatoon's daily newspaper applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing in the matter of R. v. Glen Ivor Jones on May 14, 2002. The journalists had no prior opportunity to hear its contents because Jones entered a guilty plea. The application was not opposed. The applicant sought an order for mandamus or a declaration. HELD: The presumption is in favour of public access to court records and the burden to contrary proof lies with the person who would deny access. This right is tempered by other factors (see R. v. SJS). Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General and playing the CD ROM and making their own notes balances the interests of innocent parties whose conversations were recorded.","FIAT. Saskatoon's daily newspaper applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing. The accused entered a guilty plea and was not played for the sentencing judge. The applicant sought an order for mandamus, or a declaration. The Registrar of the Provincial Court advised the applicant it must apply to the appropriate court with notice to the Crown for an order to obtain access. Both counsel agreed that the proper court to determine the issue of access was the Court of Queen's Bench. The Attorney General did not oppose the application. It merely sought a court order to release the CD-RROM to the applicant. HELD: 1) The applicant was entitled to make its own copy. It would like to do so at its own premises and own leisure or at the Registrar's Office. 2) The appropriate court would be the court of Queen’s Bench. 3) The presumption in favour of public access to court records and the burden to the contrary proof lies upon the person who would deny the exercise of the right. This right was tempered somewhat by other factors. As stated in R. v. S.J.S., [2000] S. J.S. at para. 8, the right of access to judicial records has never been considered absolute. The governing principle is that there is a presumption in favor of free public access but that access must be supervised by the Court to ensure the integrity of the exhibit is preserved and that no abuse or harm occurs to innocent parties. This reflected with the hallmark of openness in our judicial system. McIntyre v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General) 1982 CanLII 14 (SCC), and Leader-Post v. Neuls are two examples of that principle. The presumption is in favour and public access is now under the government's control. The burden lies on the person responsible for denying the right, such as a denial of exercise, to exercise his or her right under the Constitution. The right to make a copy is conditional on the issuance of an order."
b_2004skqb105.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000. HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant.","FIAT. The defendant applied for an order requiring the plaintiff to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000. HELD: The application was granted. The amount of security was reduced to $1,460,246.10 for the counterclaim and $2,150,495.65 for services and materials provided to the plaintiff pursuant to the contract.  1)The defendant commenced another separate and distinct action (Q.B. 1431/99) in which it engaged the plaintiff as a sub-contractor to construct a directionally drilled crossing under the South Saskatchewan River.  2)The plaintiff is a non-resident party and there is a real prospect that it will be unable to pay costs if it is unsuccessful. The plaintiff should not have to bear the whole of that risk. 3)The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for costs. In the alternative, the defendant has asked for a declaration that PricewaterhouseCoopers is liable for any award of costs that may be made against the plaintiff. 4)The court has discretion. It will normally decline to order security for cost against any party to a proceeding, including a party who is ordinarily resident in Saskatchewan. 5)In the case of the Alberta action, the plaintiff was required to post security of costs of $20,000 for the supply of materials respecting failed attempt to construct the North Saskatchewan River crossing. It is important to look to the overall situation in order to decide what is just and fair. 538(1) requires a determination of the true nature of the claim. 6)Individual costs of the application should not be taken as an absolute prohibition. 7)Costs are awarded on the basis of the lien being vacated. 8)The respondent commenced the builders' lien action, which is the other action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. In this case it is reasonable to conclude that 35% of the costs should be attributed to the claim as a result. 9)Individual disbursements of $10,000 are simply described as reporting services, conduct money, copying etc. This approach does not result in the plaintiff funding the defendant's counterclaim although it can be said that this is being done through the posting of security in another action. 10)The parties agreed that Rule 539(c) should be invoked. 11)The statements must be read in the context of their factual situations. 12)The party counterclaim is"

Even if the respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, the appellant failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach. The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit. This loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did. As the trial judge found, the termination of the distributorship was unconnected to the respondent.",The respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant.

b_2007skqb388.txt,"The accused was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08. The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated. The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand. HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittal set aside. The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. The evidence was excluded because the trial judge concluded that contrary to s. 8 of the Charter the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand and that pursuant to s24(2) the Charter, the admission of the certificate of analysis into evidence would bring the administration of justice in disrepute. The court reviewed the facts in Einarson and found that not all relevant evidence was assessed by the officer who administered the ASD. The mere possibility that a driver has consumed alcohol within 15 minutes before taking the test is pure speculation. Likewise, whether the wet ground near the driver's side of the vehicle was just urine is also speculation. A new trial must therefore be held and is ordered."
b_2008skqb182.txt,"The tenant appeals the decision of the Hearing Officer granting her landlord a possession order of her rental premises. The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process. The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","The tenant appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer granting the landlord possession of her rental premises. This self-represented tenant included, as grounds of her appeal, 'procedural violations' and'misinformation as to the purpose of the hearing'. HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1) The tenants request an adjournment so that she can make arrangements to personally attend the hearing. 2) The hearing notice was properly served personally. The tenant did not appear. No notice or warning was needed. 3) The Hearing Officer, in accepting this 'boyfriend related evidence' when neither the Hearing Notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rules of natural justice and due process. The decision should be taken with a view to what is necessary to ensure that justice is done between the parties.

b_2009nsca127.txt,"A couple signed a separation agreement which included a provision whereby they agreed to renounce and waive any claim in the estate of the other and any right to share in the estate of the other, which terms were incorporated into a corollary relief judgment. When he died, the former husband had not changed his will, which left the residue of his estate to his former wife. The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift. The mother of the deceased appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed, the appellant had failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death. Even if the former spouse were so bound, there did not appear to be any privity of contract which would allow the appellant, who was not a party to the separation agreement, to enforce it.","In their separation agreement, the testator left his wife the residue of his estate. A few years later, he died in an automobile accident. They subsequently divorced. The executrix of their estate applied for an interpretation of the will and separation agreement. The deceased had neither revoked nor changed his will nor revoked or changed the beneficiary designation in the Canada Life Policy. The wife now sought to take the benefits for herself pursuant to that will. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasoning was flawed. Although the wife may have waived any claim against the estate of her late husband and the right to share in it, it is not clear from the wording of s. 20 that she waived her right to claim under the will if her husband chose not to alter his will so as to eliminate her as a beneficiary. There is no reference to a will in the will."
b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","The accused was found guilty of several drug offences after police entered his home and searched his home without a warrant. The accused alleged that the police entry and search of his home were justified because the complainant did not know exactly where he lived and there were no weapons in the home. The evidence heard on the Charter application was considered in the trial proper along with additional evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; the trial judge erred in principle in determining that the call to the police was not a 911 call but rather a 'distress' call and that the search of the accused's home was justified. The trial judge failed to consider alternatives short of police entry into the home and search without a search warrant, all without which the evidence may have been involuntary and made pursuant to threats of violence. In those circumstances, police had a responsibility to enter the residence, whether invited or not, and to search to ensure that there are no other occupants and to ensure he has no weapon. The Court reviewed the jurisprudence regarding 911 emergency response calls and found that although it was reasonable for the police to believe that something was or could be wrong, and they should find and see the accused, to go to his home, and not simply leave once the complainant told them that she was fine, she was still inside with the person reported to have abused her and possibly under his control, according to the Appeal Court."

The petitioner had previously been ordered to pay $1,000 in costs to the respondent but instead paid the $1,000 directly into the child's credit card balance and there was no evidence that this was done by mutual agreement between the parties. The child was not performing well in her program with no explanation for her poor performance. HELD The burden is on the petitioner to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence. Although the child is a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act during the time she was attending classes, her expenses are excessive. The child provided no evidence to rebut the respondent's information that she did not attend many of her classes. The child must take greater responsibility for her own expenses and debts if she does not apply herself to her studies. The respondent was ordered to match the amount paid by the petitioner towards the child's expenses.

The parties were unable to settle the sharing of the daughter's educational expenses for 2008/2009. HELD: 1) The chambers judge should match the amount paid by the applicant towards the applicant's expenses. The applicant must take greater responsibility for her own expenses and debts if she did not apply herself to her studies. The father should not be ordered to pay the table amount. It is the Court's view that an application of clause 3(2)(b) having regard to the actual means and needs of the applicant and the financial ability of each parent to contribute to her support be considered. 2) The father was directed to pay $3,452.00 on or before February 15, 2011.

HELD: The chamber's judge was in error in striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application. The Court of Appeal opted to deal with the merits of the application themselves, rather than remitting the matter back to Queen's Bench. While the allegation of fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, the pleading is nevertheless sufficient to answer the requirements of QB Rule 173. The appellants should have been given an opportunity to amend their pleadings. The appeal was allowed and the application to strike was dismissed without prejudice to respondent's right to seek further particulars.","Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] The order made by the chamber judge striking major portions of the statement of defence and counterclaim was made in error.

[2] Turning to the merits, we note that the principal question is whether the imputed allegations in the statements of defence & counterclaim meet the requirements of Queen’s Bench Rules, particularly in relation to the allegations of fraud.

The hearing officer determined that the landlord's claim for non-payment of rent had been established and that an order for possession as warranted. The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent. The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem. They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs. However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient. The Court held that it was impossible to tell whether the hearing officer considered the tenants' evidence at the hearing, made findings of fact in that regard or whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in this situation. The reasons are inadequate to allow a meaningful review of the decision.","The tenants appeal the decision of a hearing officer under s. 72 of The Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. They contend the hearing officer, who rendered her decision on May 31, 2012, committed several errors of law and seek to have the matter remitted back for re-hearing. The tenants sought to file affidavit evidence in support of their appeal. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the matter was remitted to the Hearing Officer for a new hearing. The reasons for the decision were inadequate to allow for meaningful review of the decision and were inadmissible. 1) The tenants did not dispute the landlord's claim for non-payment of rent. They contended an infestation of bed bugs in the residential premises had made it uninhabitable and forced them to incur personal expense to address this problem. 2) There was nothing in the Act either prohibiting or requiring the director to schedule multiple applications relating to a same dispute to the same hearing date. In any event, the simple fact that the tenants' application is not formally before the Hearing officer at the same time as landlord's application does not bar hearing officer from either considering the facts put forth by the tenant (provided they relate to the landlord\'s dispute) nor to give effect to the tenant's facts and arguments in rendering a decision and formulating an appropriate order. 3) The Court found the reasons inadequate for allowing a meaningful review and for this matter the matter must be remitted BACK to the HEARD.  4) It is not apparent from the decision appealed from whether the hearing officers considered the tenant’s evidence, made findings of fact in that regard or for that matter considered whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in the circumstances before her.

On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant. The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss.","The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies Hearing Officer in finding that the tenancy agreement was not a fixed-term agreement and that the landlord is legally disentitled to compensation pursuant to s. 8(1) of the Act.

The one-month notice provision was applicable only if the tenancy was extended to a month-to-month tenancy following the end of the fixed term. 2) The hearing officer misinterpreted ss. 19(1)(g)(iii) of The residential Tenancies Act and the 2006 Rules and Regulations. 3) The Hearing Officer erred in law in holding that the fact a month to monthly tenancy would follow the primary fixed term negated a fixed Term. 4) The One-Month Notice provision referred to in the Term of the Lease was only applicable if the tenant was committed to one year of one year. 5) Counsel relied on the case of 10113307 Saskatchewan Ltd. v. Mattison, 2012 SKQB 22. It was therefore the appellant who had the obligation to show that he did whatever was reasonable to minimize his loss. He spent approximately $15,000 on furnishing the unit and made the decision to do so because he felt it would be quicker and easier to re-rent to better clients. He did not advertise the unit for rent until the middle of January 2013 and obtained a new tenant effective February 1, 2013 at $2500 per month. The respondent vacated the unit on or about October 30, 2012. The monthly rental was $2100. The appellant did not attempt to rent the premises following his receipt of the notice, because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to returning it. The tenant had not complained to the landlord about the noise and did not intend to mitigate his loss by taking advantage of the opportunity to re rent."

The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys at the school. He developed the intermural hockey, competitive fastball and softball teams and the Beauval Warriors, which was the regional champion hockey team through most of the years. There were times when the relationship with various boys crossed the line from appropriate and acceptable behaviour to become acts of sexual assault and sexual interference. The Court was required to take into account the potential distraction of the trier of fact from its proper focus on the facts charged and the potential for undue time consumption."
b_2013skqb407.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the cause of the damage was high humidity in the building caused by water leaking into it from the roof. The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800. Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836. The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500.","The plaintiff landlord claims damages against its tenant, the defendant, asserting negligence by failing to clean, wax and polish the vinyl tile floor in the building, thereby permitting moisture to penetrate between and underneath the tiles resulting in lifting and cracking. The tenant also claims economic interference, alleging the landlord interfered with the sale of its restaurant. HELD: The tenant is awarded judgment against the landlord in the amount of $6,464 [$3,964 plus $2,500] in lieu of taxable costs. 1) The damage to the floor is $22,281 and the tenant is contributorily negligent to the extent of 25% of the damage. Leaking of water through the ceiling, sagging ceiling tiles, and deterioration of the floor tiles could be attributed to poor maintenance lack of sufficient polish and waxing. Although excessive moisture and high humidity within the building undermined the subfloor, causing instability and cracking of the vinyl floor tiles. 2) Moisture is 5 times in excess of standard reading for normal building samples and is due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor. 3) The evidence does show that a part, but only a small part, of the moisture entering into the building was due to negligent negligence. 4) The tenants are awarded costs for the three day trial of $1,500 inclusive of disbursements. 5) The tenant may set off the base monthly rent of $7,700 as specified in clause 8(b) of the lease."

The court applied the rules of statutory interpretation, specifically the presumption of coherence and overlap, to the provisions of the Act and found that the applicant was using s. 186.1 for a purpose that the legislature did not intend. The applicant could have proceeded to dissolution under Division XVI. In s. 210(m) the legislature intended to give the court the ability to order disposition of property of creditors and shareholders but not to deal with a shareholder’s right to distribution on dissolution.","Shareholders approved a plan of arrangement and sought an order approving it pursuant to s. 186.1 of the Business Corporations Act and s. 210(m) of the Director of Saskatchewan Corporations Branch. The Director opposed approval of the plan of arrangements on the basis that s. 204 of the Act requires a corporation to distribute its assets among its shareholders according to their respective rights. The proposal proposed by the applicant that shareholders of record should be given their pro rata entitlement to return of the corporation's capital to them rather than having a portion of the proceeds revert to the Minister of Finance in the right of Saskatchewan pursuant to the SBCA. The applicant argued the court has the power to approve such an arrangement under the powers given to it under s.186.1(4), s. 203(8) and the power given to the court in s. 220(1) should not be limited to the generality of the foregoing. HELD: The application was dismissed with no problems.  1) The court found no conflict with the authority to override the mandatory directions contained in ss. 220 and 221 in the Act.  2) There was no evidence of any conflict between the power provided by the court to approve proposed distributions in the context of liquidation or dissolution of a corporation (as does s. 192 of the CBCA); the court could order that rather than the real estate being liquidated, it be divided among the shareholders in a specie, proportionate to their entitlement as shareholders; and 3) the Court could order distribution to shareholders of their entitlement, qua shareholders, either in the form of money or in property. 4) The Court was satisfied that the proposed arrangement complied with all statutory requirements for an arrangement to be approved by the Court and satisfied the criteria enunciated in the original legislation. The Court could not find any evidence of coherence and overlap between the statutory and statutory purposes. 5) The application could not be dismissed because the Court had not limited its powers to approve a proposed distribution. The court could not locate any proposed interim or final distribution of capital that would allow the Court to determine whether the proposed distribution was fit for a purpose the legislature did not intend."

The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest. The child had lived with them since birth. The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change. These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.",HELD: The Court found that the parties were persons of sufficient interest regarding the child pursuant to s. 23(1)(a) of The Child and Family Services Act and that an indefinite order of protection was appropriate. The Ministry’s position was that the parents had been unable and unwilling to provide the minimum level of parenting required for the child to his needs and that this failure was likely to cause them physical and/or emotional harm. The Court ordered that the child be committed to the care of the parents for an indefinite period of time.
b_2018skpc52.txt,"/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry. The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","The accused was charged with angling for and consuming fish in waters closed to the public pursuant to s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995. The issue before the Court was whether the accused, as a Treaty Indian fishing for sustenance/food was bound by the regulations, and whether the regulation violated his Treaty rights. HELD: The accused was granted a stay of the charge.  1) The evidence presented was that the co-op, with the authority of the provincial government, manages and has sole discretion in determining who gets a commercial fishing licence. 2) The accused admitted to the actus reus of the substantial charge but put forth as defence his rights to fish for food in any water and at any time he so chooses.  3) The main constitutional and fisheries evidence was given by the Conservation Officer with the Ministry of the Environment who was qualified as an expert in fish biology with considerable experience in fisheries management and ecology. He was also present at the hearing on the issue of the reduction to the 5,000-kilogram quota for commercial and outfitter recreational anglers and a 19 year old Treaty Indian who resided in the area at the time of the offence. 4) The Court was unable to locate a copy of the 1993 and 1997 letters."
b_2018skqb188.txt,"HELD: The accused were each acquitted of all charges. The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation. The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him. Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G. The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer.","HELD: The Court held that an amendment to an information expanding the time particulars of the offence could be made at trial based upon evidence that indicates the offence may have been committed within the amended timeframe. Since the evidence was to the effect that marijuana plants did not start arriving until early June, grant amendment of the indictment to cover the period March 1, 2016 to September 15, 2016. The Court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that: a) they were unlawfully producing cannabis; b) they possessed the cannabis for the purposes of trafficking; c) the currency in question was obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. HELD: 1) The evidence clearly established that this was a relatively sophisticated marihuana grow operation. The plants were healthy and some four to six weeks away from harvesting. 2) Based on the totality of the evidence, the only rational conclusion to be drawn in respect of the cash found in their residence is that it was property obtained by a commission of an indictable offence in Canada."

The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 236(a) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46 and his guilty plea to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so.  1) The sentencing principles outlined in s. 743.6 of the Code apply to this case.  2) The accused has an extensive criminal record including 57 prior convictions of which are for violent offences. He has shown no remorse since he in drunken stupor shot his cousin in the head for no apparent reason. 3) Although the Crown provided the Court with multiple cases, the Crown was relying primarily upon three cases which the Court reviewed in support of its request for a 15 year global sentence with no parole eligibility until Gordon had served half of that sentence pursuant to the s. 8(1) imposed. The Court found that a global sentence of 10 years is appropriate in this case to be served in a federal penitentiary on the manslaughter conviction."

The plaintiff claimed damages for emotional distress following the failed sale of the condo. The defendant's solicitor advised the plaintiffs that they would henceforth represent their own interests and identifying their proper address in Borden, Ontario. When the plaintiff did not receive a satisfactory offer, the defendant advised her that it would be cheaper to remortgage the property for a higher mortgage than the one promised by the defendants. She waited until the afternoon prior to closing to advise the defendants that they did not have financing. This caused her significant stress and mental anguish. She incurred further debt of approximately $20,000 due to the delay in obtaining financing from the bank which had already been paid off.

She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation.

HELD: The appeal was allowed in part under Rule 129 without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to proceed for the alleged loss of $38,585. 1)The appellant was granted leave to amend its statement of defence by pleading the relevant statutory conditions in the Saskatchewan Insurance Act and any additional material facts and new matters raised by the amended statement of claim. The plaintiff was granted leave to reply. Each party was permitted to re-open the examinations for discovery. 2)The insured had no defence to the counterclaim for premiums which was a separate action. The prayer for relief was amended to claim the full amount of the premiums which were payable with interest at the rate of 10% as stipulated in the promissory note together with costs on the applicable tariff in Queen's Bench and in the Court of Appeal on single column 5.","The appellant appealed an order entered in Queen's Bench on October 15, 1998 dismissing the motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim for insurance premiums payable by the plaintiff under the hail insurance contract in question. Although the plaintiff's claim was fixed at $3,373.50 being the amount of an appraisal award, the respondent/plaintiff challenged the validity of this appraisal award purporting to be made under The Saskatchewan Insurance Act and the statutory conditions that govern such appraisals. The appellant appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed in part. 1)The appellant has satisfied the criteria in Bombardier Credit Ltd. v. Kostuchuk et al. and is entitled to judgment for $10,870 with interest at the rate of 10% as stipulated in the promissory note, plus costs in Queen Bench on the applicable tariff and costs in this Court on single column 5. In the circumstances, the counterclaim as an independent action is granted. 2)There are a number of 'housekeeping' items that must be addressed in order to facilitate the orderly disposition of the action (including the pleadings). The appellant has been granted leave to amend its statement of defence to the plaintiffs claim by pleading the relevant statutory conditions in the Saskatchewan insurance act, together with any additional material facts pertaining to that defence."
c_2000skqb232.txt,"FIAT. The husband seeks to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' 1975 separation agreement. This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first. The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years. The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income. In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement. At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent. The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income. This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support. The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement. The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent. The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support.","FIAT. The divorced husband applied to vary the spousal support provisions contained in a separation agreement dated June 18, 1975. By virtue of paragraph 4(a) of the agreement the parties agreed the initial sum of $550 would be paid for in 1959. Although this was unilaterally reduced in 1995 it was subsequently increased to $627.55 per month after the wife remarried or died in whichever date the sooner. The application was dismissed with costs to the husband. The modest income of the respondent indicates that the agreement clearly stated that there would be a complete, final and effective settlement of their respective rights. The retirement of the applicant and the reduction of his income as a consequence is or was reasonably foreseeable at the time the agreement was entered into. The fact it had occurred is not that kind of radical unforseen change in circumstance required to be established upon the authorities to support the variation application. Nor am I persuaded that the respondent's modest income provides any proper ground for variation of the agreements. She still had a much lower standard of living than the applicant even after taking into account the amount she is receiving as spouse support."
c_2002nssc30.txt,"The borrower in a mortgage foreclosure action counterclaimed against the lender and joined the insurer of the mortgage and experts he had retained for advice in the development on the basis of negligent misrepresentation. During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate. No privilege was claimed during the discovery process. The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs. Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver. There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.","The plaintiff was a party to a mortgage foreclosure commenced by the defendants. The plaintiff sought to insure the mortgage with the CMHC through its mortgage insurance program and retained the services of a Kentville lawyer. The mortgage fell into arrears during construction of the complex. The defendants made application for further disclosure, and the plaintiff brought a counterclaim for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, or for negligence. At issue was whether the defendants had induced the plaintiff to make voluntary disclosure or consented to disclosure of any material part of the transaction, and whether the plaintiff waived his right to rely on the representations of the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was granted leave to produce the documents sought. The counterclaim was discontinued due to lack of time. 1)The plaintiff knew of the privilege as it had been expressly addressed prior to discovery and then by attending the discovery and in the absence of objection evinced an intention to partially waive it.  2)The documents sought were found to have at best tenuous relevance. While 'fishing trips' in Nova Scotia is permitted in certain circumstances, the defendants did not insist upon an 'undertaking' or something 'equivalent to contract' as proposed by Lord Devlin. 3)In the circumstances the plaintiff was entitled to rely upon the advice and opinions of the defendant's solicitor prior to making the application for the documents. He was also entitled to receive expert testimony. 4)The court found that a waiver of solicitor-client privilege may be inferred from the documents produced voluntarily. The documents sought appeared to have had some relevance to the plaintiff's defence and counterclaim. The documentary evidence did not provide any information directly for explanation for any non-compliance."
c_2003skpc139.txt,"The Provincial Director applied pursuant to s. 98 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act for continuance of the custody portion of a custody and supervision sentence made pursuant to s. 42(2)(n). The Provincial Director was concerned that, because S.T.T. had not followed through with his treatment, he was at a high risk to offend again. HELD: The application lacked compelling reasons to keep the young person in custody.  1) This was the first experience with an application of this nature in Saskatoon and the Court provided a detailed discussion of the procedure for the benefit of future applications. 2) The application was not brought in a reasonable time having regard to all of the circumstances. The young person must be put on notice that the application is being made. 3) The Review (Progress) Report is a form of disclosure for the young person and should be available well in advance of the hearing.","This was an application by the Provincial Director pursuant to s. 98 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act for continuation of the custody portion of a custody and supervision sentence made under s. 42(2)(n). The Young Person was 18 years old when he appeared on the application. He had served 180 days in custody and had only 90 days remaining for the community supervision portion. The issue was whether the young person was likely to commit a serious violent offence before the expiry of the youth sentence, which would be a relatively short period of time where the application was brought near the end of his sentence. HELD: The youth was ordered released pending a full hearing. The court was instructed to consider the merits of the application on a prima facie basis. There was no defect that was fatal to the decision regard remand or release pending the hearing. There are a number of alternatives short of continuing open custody which can increase the level of supervision and are to be taken rarely. However the test for continued custody does not appear too stringent as the court need only be satisfied on reasonable grounds of the governing criteria for continuation. There is also no evidence of pattern of persistent violent behaviour. The young person had been convicted of assault, robbery, assault with a weapon and had been sentenced to 180 days open custody followed by 90 days in the community, concurrent. The offences occurred within 1 month of each other. There were no new convictions obtained. The accused had a record of 2 serious violent offences, 1 of which was a serious one. He incurred no new offences in the 180 days that he had been in custody or indeed since his March 10th remand. The most immediate limitation was that there was no change in the risk of re-offending if the accused re-entered the community."
c_2003skqb197.txt,"The plaintiff brought a professional negligence claim against her former solicitors with respect to their handling of three charges against her for practising medicine without a licence and one charge for providing medical treatment, while not registered under the Medical Professions Act. The solicitors brought a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A. HELD: The motion for a non-suit was granted. The claim was dismissed. Although given an opportunity, the plaintiff failed to call expert evidence respecting the elements of negligence including the duty of care, standard of care, breach of the duty of care or causation. The solicitors were awarded one set of costs taxed on column 4.","Following the completion of the plaintiff's civil trial by judge and jury, counsel for the defendants presented a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A. The rule provides that the defendant may, without being called upon to elect whether he will call evidence, move for dismissal of the action. HELD: The Court held that there was no evidence upon which a jury could find negligence and causal connection between that negligence and the alleged injury and consequent damages. There was no expert evidence presented by the plaintiff to the jury to provide the jury with the competence to reach a conclusion on this second most fundamental issue, namely, whether the standard of care imposed upon lawyers undertaking the task of representing a client in her circumstances was breached by the defendants. The Court reviewed the cases and found that professional negligence claims advanced by a plaintiff against a medical specialist and a related corporate defendant fall within the range of issues which the jury would have to decide in this case. Regarding the first issue, the Court found that a verdict for the plaintiff was open to the defendant and that if the evidence fell short of establishing the existence of standard practice, the question arises as to whether the jury could determine the applicable standard without the aid of expert evidence."
c_2003skqb519.txt,"The Court was presented with a consent judgment. The respondent was unrepresented. The Court found the terms of the consent judgment were so unfair as to be unconscionable. HELD: The Court refused to issue the order on the grounds that the Court must not be seen as legitimatizing, condoning, acquiescing or approving of an unconscionable bargain.","The Court presented with a form of judgment bearing the consents of the two parties. At first blush, the Court should grant the parties the relief they appear to jointly be seeking. However, the proposed judgment are unconscionable. There has not been equality in the bargaining positions of the parties. The two parties seem content to receive assets mainly in the value of their car, which represents her receiving about 13% of the net value of the family property estate, leaving the remaining 87% to be the petitioner's share. The proposed judgment also provides that the petitioner is not obliged to pay child support in the foregoing circumstances. The parties do not need Court order nor judgment to attain their apparent goals. It is certainly open to them to proceed with this arrangement without the formality of a judgment or contract. However the parties have come to the Court requesting the proposed form of consent judgment. HELD: When the terms of a consent judgment appear to be patently unfair or unconscionsable to one of parties, it is the Court's responsibility to refuse the application. 1)No reasonable person would conclude the proposal was anything but unconscioable and would speculate that at some point in the future, she will come to realize how much she was owed by the petitioner. 2)The Court could not condone the pleading of the petitioner and the respondent but would urge her to seek legal counsel and advice. Counsel could not and would not advise her on the best way to obtain the best possible advice and guidance. The court could not urge the petitioner to acquiesce or seek legal advice or advice from counsel who could clearly and clearly advise her how to use the legal advice and advice available to her and her counsel accordingly. Counsel would not be able to give advice or guidance on such an application but would strongly advise her not to seek advice or assistance from counsel and would be strongly encouraged to do so. Counsel should not have given advice on how to properly advise and counsel the petitioner as to the best advice and counsel available. 3)There was no equality in bargaining positions. The petitioner was prepared to forfeit her right to spousal support though she earned only $15,000.00 year while the respondent's income may amount to less than $1,600 in all. The Court could neither condone nor favor legal advice nor advice but would be encouraged to look for legal guidance and counsel. 4)The parties did not need court order or judgment to achieve their apparent goal. They were not seeking to force or coerce counsel or advice but were seeking guidance"
c_2006nsca45.txt,"The president of a company against whom the Securities Commission had ordered an investigation applied to the court for certiorari to quash the investigation. He alleged that the investigators had improperly obtained and used the contents of his email, some of which were subject to solicitor and client privilege. In the context of the certiorari application, the company president successfully argued that the Commission's return should contain the fruits of the investigation so far and that he should be entitled to examine one of the investigators for discovery. The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made. Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints. The decision as to whether or not to release the information sought required the balancing of competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case; the Commission was in the best position to conduct such an exercise.","The respondent received an investigation order (which was amended on a couple of occasions) for the investigation of the trading in the securities of Knowledge House Inc. Mr. Potter applied to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for certiorari to quash that investigation. Following a number of procedural issues, the respondent's application for a stay of the proceedings was granted and the judicial review application was dismissed. At the very beginning of the appeal, much of what the respondent sought to have included in the record or to obtain by discovery was to be kept confidential unless the Commission grants permission for its release. The issues raised on appeal were whether the Court should allow the respondent to take his complaints to the Commission in the first instance or to the courts by way of certioraris application. HELD: The Court granted leave to appeal and directed the application for the underlying judicial review to be stayed. There is no express language and no clear legislative intention in s. 29A to take away the inherent authority of the superior court to order production. There are many administrative and practical issues to be addressed even before the privilege issue is finally resolved. The proper interpretation of the Act and the exercise of discretion by the Commission is to be considered.  1)The respondent is a person directly affected by the commission's investigation orders and, in particular, by the way the investigation authorized by those orders has been conducted. He needs to know what the investigators did in order to mount his challenge. The Commission is in the best position and has the statutory discretion to perform that balancing. Its decisions in this area are entitled to judicial deference.  2)Although many issues are raised at the preliminary stage of the investigation, the Court was of the view that judicial review would require some degree of restraint and it was not necessary to address the issue of appropriateness of the application on this application. The Court was also of the opinion that the chambers judge misinterpreted the provisions in Glover v. Canada (Minister of National Defence) (2005), 231 N.S.R. (2d) 129 (S.C.A.) to have decided otherwise. The Chambers judge should not have entertained the applicant's interlocutory application because he was not seeking judicial review but rather was seeking an order quashing, staying and prohibiting the Commission from pursuing the investigation. In this case, the issues of solicitor and client privilege would inevitably be addressed in court under s29F(3). However, the Commission appears to have the power and the tools to address these complaints."
c_2006skqb87.txt,"The appellant appeals its conviction of selling tobacco to a minor contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act. The appellant argues that the learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is entered.  1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place. 2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence. The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law. Had the appropriate standard of due diligence been applied to the facts of this case, the appellant would have succeeded.","The defendant was convicted on a summary conviction charge. The defendant appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case and by failing to apply the doctrine of stare decisis. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was quashed, the sentence was vacated and an acquittal entered.  1)The trial judge was required to consider what a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances to avoid this offence. The system implemented by the defendant in R. v. Westfair Foods Ltd. and Roy H. Friesen to prevent the sale of tobacco to minors was essentially the same as the procedure followed by Westfair in this case. 2)The evidence at the trial suggested that prior to the incident on August 25, 2003, the defendant had an established system to prevent their cashiers from selling cigarettes to minors. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonably person. 3)Westfair was awarded a $3,000.00 fine."
c_2008skca28.txt,"The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer. The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit from the respondent, developer. It was the only planned unit of its kind in the warehouse the developer proposed to convert to a 26 unit condominium. The developer decided not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it instead to a single story unit (Unit 5). The appellant registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land on which the land stood. The respondent later sold the unit to third party purchaser. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property' as there is nothing in the Chambers judge order that suggests that she in any way touched upon the substantive issue, namely the issue whether the purchase agreement was frustrated by supervening events. The Chambers judge's finding that the remedy of specific performance was not available did not constitute an adverse finding against the appellant on the issue of frustration."
c_2009skpc31.txt,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. (Chisum), was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1. The accused admitted to consuming aspen logs from the forest in the Weyakwin district north of Prince Albert. The logs were cut to length and then loaded onto semi-truck. The defence argued that the process detailed in P-1 encompassed the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. HELD: The defendant was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 1) The process used by the respondent was more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. The creation of a chisum log is processing and must require a processing licence. 2) The respondent did not have a forest product processing facility licence as required by s. 3 of the Act. 3) The Court found that the respondent had not breached any of the statutory or regulatory requirements set out in the Act, nor did it establish that the Crown had shown it required such a licence. 4) The evidence was found to support the defence's argument that the applicant had taken many steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in its log home packages. 5) The court found that there was no evidence that the petitioner, through its contractor, Logging (P E) harvested aspen trees specifically for the purpose of the logging industry. The process was not an insignificant process, nor was it removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest land."
c_2009skqb433.txt,"The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption. Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care. The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody. HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","The parents sought an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoption. The boys were apprehended from the care of their maternal grandparents, A.H. and Laura. The parents opposed the application and petitioned the Court to return the boys to their care. At the onset of the trial, the mother of the boys testified that she was overwhelmed as a parent by the boys' need for stability and routine. She also questioned the parents' willingness to care for the boys. HELD: The children were placed with the parents. 1) The court found that the parents had a laissez-faire approach to sexuality and that it was incumbent upon them to keep the children in their home. The Court ordered that the children should be apprehended from Art and Laura and placed in the custody of the Minister until the age of 18. 2) There was considerable evidence from the parents concerning photographs (P-3) and activities (A.H.). The family was now faced with the issue of whether Art was the biological father of the two boys. 3) The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s.37(2)(a) of the Children and Family Services Act (CFS). The Court concluded that this was yet another judicial error. The children had special needs of some sort, even high needs. They were exposed to sexual activity by their parents, who were often in the house nude and masturbating in front of their children. There was no touching at the time of the offence. The photographs were found to be of young women in various stages of dress and undress. Although they had no social skills and did not know how to play with other children, they did know that they were molested by Art. The photos were exhibited at a therapeutic foster home which was occupied by the parents and all the children, ages 8 and 3, plus the boys, were often left alone with their mother and grandparents. It was concluded that the Stevens home met the necessary physical requirements for caring for the children placed in such a home."
c_2009skqb514.txt,"FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600.","The mother has filed a motion requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the 2008 order. As the Gunn J order is premised on the child, Adam, residing with the mother and the child David no longer lives with either parent. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. The fact that the father spent his severance funds on legal fees and to set up his new home in Alberta is irrelevant. The severance is included as part of the father's income. With respect to the capital gain, which is a non-reoccurring amount, the father is a substantial contributor. However, it is clear that he will not earn the sum of $270,000 in the 2009 taxation year. The father has only one source of income, being his new employment position. It would be unfair to have the father continue to provide support on the basis of an income in which he will earn less than that amount. If the parties proceeded in accordance with their own agreement and consent order they would be forced to remit back the overpayment."

He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD: The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability. The accused said that his lawyer was the judge, could not answer when asked what the judge's role was and he had limited insight into why he was in Court. The accused met the portion of the limited cognitive capacity test which requires an understanding of the nature of the proceedings and their possible consequences and the accused is capable of communicating his version of the events surrounding the allegations, but there is no possibility he could participate in a meaningful way in the trial. According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence. The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding.","The accused was found unfit to stand trial for a variety of offences. The Court found that he had at least some recollection of the events, but there was not any possibility that he would be able to participate in his trial in a meaningful way. The evidence showed that he was unable to understand the nature of the proceedings, understand the possible outcomes and the role of the various players in the trial, and was susceptible to suggestion."
c_2011skqb100.txt,A judgment issued from the Court along with a writ of execution. The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT: The Agricultural Credit Corporation seeks an order from the Court of Appeal requiring the legal office of Eggum, Abrametz and Eggum to produce to the sheriff of the Judicial Centre of Prince Albert, the shares owned by Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co. Ltd. pursuant to the June 5, 2001 writ of execution. HELD: 1) The solicitor's lien arises out of s. 66(3) of The Legal Profession Act. The solicitor has no rights greater than those of the client. He owns the shares himself. He has not pledged, hypothecated, sold or encumbered the said share certificate which would require them to be delivered to any third party in accordance with any obligations or encumbrances he may have placed against the same shares. There is no such restriction in the Executions Act nor in the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. 2) The sheriff has the power to seize shares of a company and to seize them in order to collect the outstanding debt. 3) The portion of the affidavit that was given to the court was uncontroverted. There was nothing before the court that even remotely suggests that the Jensen is not not the owner of the shares in question. The shares are his and his alone. They cannot be subsumed to the company and thus become liable to solicitor’s lien as being part of the records of the company. The claim for lien is not made out. 4) Given the totality of what was before me, the Court did not consider a valid solicitor lien to have been made out as there was nothing to determine the amount owing by the plaintiff for legal work done for it. 5) The only claim against his shares within the company was the claim as creditor. It is on this principle that Courts of Equity order solicitors acting for clients who are parties to actions to produce documents on which the solicitors have lien, if their production is necessary for the purpose of doing justice to other persons besides their respective clients.  6) The Court ordered the law firm to produce and deliver the shares of the plaintiff to the Sheriff pursuant to s. 21(1). 7) The court ordered that leave of the court must be obtained to enforce the writ. 8) The shares in the company could be seized at all pending leave as they would all have some form of farm land as part of their company. 9) There was no evidence that the sheriff would refuse to hand over the shares to the plaintiff pursuant to a solicitor's Lien. 10) The"

At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: possession of a controlled substance for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act; unlawfully possessing property (or proceeds of property), knowing that all of the property was obtained (or derived directly or indirectly) as a result of the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to section 354 and 355(a). The accused had nine prior drug convictions since his arrest, two for trafficking and one conspiracy to traffic which resulted him receiving a sentence of 5 years in the penitentiary; his pre-trial detention was in part the result of a failed preliminary hearing which saw the prosecutor unable to reach Estevan. The court accepted the accused's deposition that he was a compliant prisoner, had no disciplinary issues or problems while on remand and that he would have qualified, had he been in the regular prison population, for a one-third reduction in his sentence for the current offences. The Court gave the accused credit for one and one-half days for each day he spent in custody for the past three and a half years, the same to be served unless otherwise permitted at a provincial correctional centre in Saskatchewan. The accused was ordered to pay a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,325.98 to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the sentence of imprisonment imposed by this judgment is ordered."

HELD: The Court granted judgment for damages in the amount of $3,822 for necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning expenses and granted the counter-claim in the amount of $580 for unpaid work performed by the defendant and then applied setoff. The Court allowed the cost of issuing the claim and for reasonable cost of service.","HELD: The counterclaim was set off against the plaintiff's claim of $5,975.95 for the removal of a bedroom wall.

c_2012skqb372.txt,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application to strike the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution or compel the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Mutual Insurance. HELD: 1) The delay from June 2010 to May 2012 really is a delay from May 2011 until May 2012 and solely on the head of counsel for the plaintiff for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. While one year is an excessive period of time it is not at such an early stage that it would lead the Court on its own to strike. 2) As the defendant is retired from active business, this delay is not causing him any professional embarrassment or damage to reputation. This is not matter that the file is in the public's eye and therefore very few people would even know that it is currently in existence. The context in which the delay occurred is one year of inexcusable delay. 3) As examinations for discovery are completed this matter is at a point where it could well go to pre-trial conference. 4) The defendant has made its case and ordered the specific amounts for each structure for which it settled its claim to be disclosed."
c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. In reaching this decision, the court held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply and that hearsay evidence was not admissible. The court also held that records kept by the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. Hearsay evidence is admissible; the Crown did not call the authors of the reports nor did defence seek to cross-examine them. The Crown applied to have the criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and the NPB's reasons for ordering detention admitted into evidence. The accused was not released until the sentence expired in March 2012. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) There are many proceedings in our criminal law and Criminal Code that allow evidence that does not meet the admissibility rules prescribed for criminal trials to be admitted and serve as the basis for making a decision. 2) The Court found that s.810 hearings are not criminal trials. The usual rule of evidence applicable in criminal trials do not apply. 3) The standard of review is correctness on a question of law. Section 810 does not create an offence but rather it seeks to prevent the commission of a criminal offence. It is preventative rather than punitive. The burden of proof rests upon the Crown and requires proof on balance of probabilities. The test is both subjective and objective. It must be established (1) that the victim actually fears that the defendant will cause personal injury to him; and (2) reasonable grounds exist for the informant's fear. The first condition is subjective, while the second is objective; namely, the Crown must establish subjectively that the informant has a belief and whether his belief is objectively founded. Inference where information not in a business record (e) or (f) of a record (such as a statement of fact) is reasonable ground to believe, the inference from which the inference arises from the fact that the record is not a record made in the course of obtaining or giving legal advice or in contemplation of legal proceeding, or from an affidavit attested to before an official of a foreign state, is a factor which must be satisfied. 4) Inference with non-business reasons (e.g. a decision to admit or deny a report or a reason for"

Report by Back-Track Investigations and Special Services Ltd. supports the plaintiff's belief that damage occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of a substance from the alley. However, the evidence does not support that. In preceding years, before it was moved to the Statchuk yard, it was used to store tools, machinery and applicators. The floor in it replaced before moving to his yard. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed.

The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause. Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products. Prior to 1985 that activity, exclusively wholesale, was achieved through a nation wide network of outlets leased from the appellant and operated by agents on a commission basis. Those agents were not required to make personal investment in the franchise, provide staff of two, rather than three, and assume control and financial responsibility for the inventory. The appellant knew from the outset that Murphy was not going to operate the franchise full-time himself but would rely on the former Atlas employees. The trial judge found that such an assumption was not supported by the evidence. He held that the clause did not foreclose the respondents' right to rely upon the breach of a warranty. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge made certain findings of fact which affected his assessment of the facts. Amongst other findings, he found that: 1) the respondent had not conducted any such independent investigation; 2) it was not encouraged by the appellant to participate in such an investigation; 3) the appellant was induced to enter into the agreement by the Guarantor to provide direct supervision and attention to the franchise in order to ensure the proper, efficient and effective operation of the franchise; and 4) there was no evidence that the appellant had entered into an honest and transparent understanding of the business venture contemplated by the franchisee.

She was in receipt of unemployment insurance benefits $318 every two weeks plus whatever casual work she could obtain. Her employment with Bartch Building Movers was terminated. Her total income in 1996 totalled $1,404.44. Given the petitioner's casual employment, it was difficult to determine her level of income for the purpose of her application for maintenance.

d_1999canlii1536.txt,"A wife claimed part of the estate of her estranged husband. The Court considered the applicability of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, the Matrimonial Property Act, and the Pension Benefits Act. Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate, that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed. To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator. This involves a very broad judicial discretion. Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance.","Two separate actions were commenced following the death of a doctor, who claimed to be the son of the deceased doctor and sought entitlement to his late father's estate by 1998. Following certain pre-trial communications among counsel and discovery examinations of important witnesses, it became obvious that there were circumstances surrounding the doctor's death which might reasonably be considered suspicious. Several procedural agreements were reached including that proof in solemn form would be required, with the case to be tried by Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, sitting in Probate. Jurisdiction to hear a case such as this flowed from the Probate Act and is based on the historic statutory, common law and equity authorities of the pre-confederation court modelled on the English Probate Court.

d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposed the application and requested a summary trial. HELD: 1) Rule 488 sets out the test for summary judgement. The judge shall grant judgment unless, (a) the judge is unable to decide the issues in the action in the absence of cross-examination; (b) it would be otherwise unjust to determine the issues on the motion, whereupon the judge shall order summary trial, or the trial of specified issue or issues. 2) In the case of a person in the plaintiff's position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice period selected should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there is a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non- management one. 3) The plaintiff was able to obtain employment within two and one-half months of the end of the notice given to him by the employer at wage considerably below what he had earned with the defendant. 4) Taking all factors into account, this is an appropriate notice period to which the plaintiff was entitled.  5) In this case the plaintiff does not agree with the judge's description of the meeting or what was said by him during the meeting but will not review the same. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment, and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer."
d_2000canlii19583.txt,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The facts as outlined by the accused on his behalf and by his son-in-law on the other are at variance in material ways. While the bodily harm resulted directly from the effect of third parties falling on top of the accused and Brown, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as direct as the accused's actions. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to the accused in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions."
d_2000skqb366.txt,"The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction pursuant to s.65 of the Queen's Bench Act and Queen's Bench Rule 387(a) prohibiting and restraining the respondents from producing and manufacturing potassium sulphate near Alsask until further order; an order restraining the respondent from selling, marketing, or disposing of the potassium sulphate for profit until further order; other ancillary relief; costs of the application. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents in any event of the cause. The applicant did not demonstrate an entitlement to injunctive relief on the second and third stages of the three stage test. The applicant demonstrated there was a serious question to be tried but failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm. The delay (the action was commenced February 16, 1998) was considered. On balance the respondents would suffer greater harm if the injunction were granted as the respondent Nylen makes his living marketing and selling potassium sulphate.","The applicant sought injunctive relief and an order prohibiting the respondent and Potash Corp. (the defendant) from producing and marketing potassium sulphate and restraining the defendants from selling, marketing or otherwise disposing of it during the life of the injunction. The factual foundation upon which the applicant relies is that the defendant entered into the Technology Licensing Agreement with the view to considering Big Quill's technology as a possible option for its Alsask plant. The defendant states that it only obtained documentation this spring sufficient to confirm the design of the plant and the flow charts illustrating the process being used to produce the potassium. HELD: 1) The applicant obtained an exclusive license from the defendant to use the ion exchange technology licensed to it by the defendant. 2) The defendant is attempting to assert that it somehow has a proprietary interest in the scientific principles known as ion exchange and crystallization. Such a process, however, consists of public, non-patented scientific principles and the defendant provided no machinery or equipment to the plaintiff. SOTec Products Ltd. initiated the development of the proposed plant from scratch with the assistance of third parties and did not use the defendant's technology. It did not exist at the time of the acquisition of the assets. It was only in 1996 that the plaintiff acquired a patent for a process that was based upon the same basic scientific principles as the one described in the patent. It is not a patented process. While the defendant undoubtedly had a system of machines and equipment that were configured in a certain way so as to utilize an ion exchangeand crystallization process, such was not the only one that could be utilized to produce potassium. The plaintiff established its own plant near the plaintiff's property and was unsuccessful in its bid to acquire the assets of the defendant in that it was a result of a breach of the agreement. In the course of this action the defendant is also prohibited by the Act from marketing any product that is not already produced by the plaintiff and pursuant to the terms of the exclusive marketing agreement from which the agreement was entered. In addition, the defendant has not obtained the necessary documentation to establish exactly what information the plaintiff is required to disclose in order to enter into an interlocutory injunction. If the defendant decides to use it, it will become obliged to pay the fee specified in the Agreement.  2) In addition to the defendant having obtained the information from the plaintiff, it was also aware prior to the commencement of the action that it could not obtain sufficient assurances that the defendants' system was efficient enough for its needs."
d_2001nssc85.txt,"The applicant was aware that allegations of abuse had been made against him in an alternative dispute resolution process undertaken by the Province with respect to his former employment. He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations. The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed. Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven. The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo. The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes. The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant. Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province. There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy. The applicant was entitled to know what he had been accused of and should have the right to correct the record.","The appellant was denied access to information requested pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. The appellant had made an application to the Department of Justice (the Attorney General) for information on the proposed ADR process. At the beginning of the process, the respondent was given certain 'can say' statements by former residents of the institutions which outlined all of the accusations made against him. The respondent later appealed the denial of access. At that time, the Attorney General had also made an inquiry into the extent of the abuse in the institutions. The purpose of the investigation was to determine whether the allegations were true. The objective of the ADR was to investigate whether there had been abuse at the institutions for youth correction and protection. It was also intended to ensure that victims of sexual abuse would be compensated. The process was suspended in 1996 and was to be re-examined in 1998. In 1999, the Acting Attorney General, who had been appointed by the Minister of Justice, made a similar recommendation to the respondent in his own report. In his report, he also detailed the difficulties faced by the applicant in attempting to obtain information about the proposed process. He also detailed how the applicant was able to participate in the process without exposing herself to the Justice Department's scrutiny. Throughout the course of the trial, the appellant was given specific information about his background, work and employment history. He was also given specific instructions on how to obtain the information requested. In the end, the information was not given to the applicant until the completion of the Access to Information and Privacy Act (access to the records) or until the applicant had made a claim for compensation. The application was refused. The applicant appealed under section 41(1) of the Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs in the amount of $10,000. The court ordered that the information be provided to the appropriate third party pursuant to ss. 41(2) and 41(3). It ordered the disclosure of any information that may have been prejudicial to the integrity of the justice system or to the fairness, truth and objectivity of the court system. The information was also ordered to be disclosed to third parties. The administration of justice was to provide the information in an expeditious fashion."

The Provincial Court trial judge did not accept the accused's testimony that his blood-alcohol concentration was between .068 and .081 at the time of driving. On appeal the Queen's Bench judge set aside the conviction and ordered an acquittal. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Queen's Bench judgment was set aside and the Provincial Court trial judgment was restored. While the appellate judge stated the correct standard of review, he did not in fact apply it and made inaccurate assessments of the evidence and conclusion of the trial judge.","The accused was convicted by a Provincial Court judge of having care and control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge acquitted him of the charge, on appeal, the Court of Queen's Bench judge set aside the conviction and ordered an acquittal. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The trial judge erred in her analysis of the evidence and conclusions of the trial judge. In her analysis she made inaccurate assessments of the facts and the conclusions of trial judge thereon. The acquittal because of reasonable doubt on the.08 charge did not have, expressly or inferentially, included in it a finding by the Court that he accepted the testimony that the accused's blood alcohol was between.068 and.081 at the time of driving. He did not, in fact, so accept the testimony of the complainant. 2)The appeal must be allowed. The judgment of the Provincial Court Judge was correct in concluding that the evidence raised reasonable doubt as to the appellant's condition, and that reasonable doubt ought to have been exercised in favour of the appellant. 3)The conviction cannot stand. The appellant is acquitted on the count of impaired driving. 4)The appellate court judge did not apply the correct standard of review, which is to say that the judge applied it in the circumstances. It was inconsistent with the facts, which are his sole province, to say, as the appellate judge did, that the appellant did not see any indicia of impairment. 5)The court judge's interpretation of the expert evidence that the blood alcohol content in the blood of the respondent was in the range of.68 to.81 at that time was reversible error. 6)The appellant's ability to concentrate and his judgment were unaffected. The fact that he was driving on the wrong side of the street and collided with a vehicle travelling in the opposite direction, along with the poor footing, contributed to the observed'very staggered' walk and it was also quite possible that the alcohol he had consumed played part in his impairment. The conviction could not stand. 7)The Court of Appeal judge's analysis that she erred with respect to post-driving conduct did not in fact apply to this case. The verdict of the appellate court was set aside."
d_2006nsca24.txt,"In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home. The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","The husband applied for an interlocutory order that the matrimonial home be sold and the wife to return certain personal belongings. The wife had been cut off her husband's medical insurance coverage and would not receive any further income until she started receiving old age security and CPP. She also wanted title to her house back. In an oral decision at the conclusion of the hearing, the chambers judge ordered that the home be put up for sale and that the husband should continue to pay spousal support of $800 monthly, that the wife should immediately return certain valuables that were already paid for by the husband, and that title should be divided equally between the parties after deducting legal fees and real estate commission. At no time did the husband try to quantify the division of property he was looking for, let alone express the view he is seeking an equal division of assets, or even half of the home equity. HELD: The husband's application was allowed and the case was remitted to the Supreme Court on an expedited basis for rehearing and proper determination. Pursuant to an interim order, the husband was paying spousals of approximately $800 a month, which would continue until the day after the payment of support arrears and a reinstatement of her benefits under his medical insurance plan. In the circumstances, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking the value of the house, and the parties' individual contributions to that value into account when then classifying, quantifying and dividing matrimonial assets. The facts and history of the case were obviously well known to him and it might accelerate these proceedings and bring about a more timely conclusion if he were able to hear it. Otherwise the matter could be directed to any other member of the Court."
d_2006nssc73.txt,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","The parties were married for four years and had four children. They separated in October 2004 after the petitioner (who was working part-time and lived with her mother when she was not attending university) filed a counter-petition for divorce. The parties have four children from their first marriage. The petitioner is the primary parent of the children and the primary caregiver to the children. The respondent is 65 years old and retired. He drives a taxi from time to time. He lives in a three bedroom apartment in Lower Sackville approximately 10 minutes walk from the children's school. Although they have been living together for many years, the parties have been experiencing some difficulty in the past few years due to the petitioner's increasingly high school enrollment and the fact that she is unable to participate in school activities. The children remain extremely loyal to the parties and refuse to have an opinion of either parent's motives or actions. It would be in the best interests of the parties to be in joint custody with their mother. The court reviewed the various parenting styles and found that most of them were based on the respondent's traditional roles. The Court found that it would be best for the children to be placed in the custody and primary care of his mother."
d_2007skpc27.txt,"The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The Crown applied to have the initial statements made by the complainant admitted into evidence for the truth of their contents as an exception to the rule which presumptively excludes hearsay evidence. The facts were relatively straight-forward. The complainant was the common-law spouse of the accused and had been for seven years. She was upset and crying and asked the police to be called. The police arrived within minutes of the complainant returning from her friend's house. She told the police that she and the accused had an argument over a bank card. During the course of this argument, the accused put his hands on her neck in an attempt to strangle her and she tipped over. She alleged that the accused grabbed her by the neck and threw her on the floor. She also alleged that she was too intoxicated to provide a credible statement. HELD: The Court found that the test of necessity for reliability had been met. The accused's evidence was important to the Crown's case and there was no other means of obtaining that evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she was a hostile witness was immaterial at this stage. The Court pointed to the accused's subsequent jealous and possessive behaviour as evidence of reliability."
d_2007skqb324.txt,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.",The accused applied for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant and the evidence ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused argued that the Provincial Court judge did not have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. HELD: The evidence obtained pursuant to a valid authorization to intercept private communications contained the following: 4. The accused's private communications with the complainant were intercepted in anticipation of eliciting responses from the accused that would provide evidence concerning the alleged offences; and 5. There was no Charter breach. The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not violate the accused's s. 8 rights. Even if there was a breach it was not serious and was inadvertent and admitting the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The intercepted communication was non-conscriptive evidence and was properly admitted by the trial judge.

The other personal representative of the estate, who was the intestate's spouse, was in receipt of survivor benefits under the pension and, as such, was opposed to the intended court action. The biological child applied to have his stepmother removed as a personal representative of the estate. Application dismissed; the removal of the personal representative would only be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate if the intended lawsuit was feasible, which it was not. The estate was bound by the terms of the pension plan, which provided that the respondent was clearly entitled, as the spouse of the intestate, to survivor benefits and the payment of a lump sum into her estate if she died within five years of the intestate's retirement.","The Estate applied for an order removing the respondent as personal representative. The respondent was employed by the respondent for thirty-one years. During that period, the respondent contributed to a pension plan valued at two hundred eighty-three thousand two hundred thirty-seven dollars ($283,237.00). The intestate determined that the respondent was not spouse within the meaning of the Pension Plan for Employees of the respondent and the Pension Benefits Standards Act and therefore was not entitled to the survivor benefits. The Respondent, as Adminstratrix of the Estate, would be required to bring an action against herself in her personal capacity. The Application must fail.

d_2012skqb237.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath.","An appeal from a conviction in the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan that the appellant did, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge was in a position to test the credibility of the officer who made the demand for a sample of the appellant's breath after making the formal arrest as argued by the appellant. 2) Even excluding the slurred speech and bloodshot eyes, the remaining indicia which the officer observed provide ample evidence to support her belief the appellant was operating his motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired. 3) The officer testified to a whole list of factors in her evidence. There was not the slightest indication that she didn't make observations or truly act upon them. The subjective element in determining whether she had reasonable and probable grounds to make the demand is not present. The trial court found that the officer had reasonable, probable grounds and, in coming to his conclusion he considered the totality of the evidence, the trial judge's ultimate ruling was subject to review for correctness. 4) The appeal was correct. The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument dealt only with the contention that the police officer did not have reasonable and reasonable grounds to arrest him and to demand that he provide sample of his breath for analysis, thereby infringing his right under ss. and of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule to the Canada Act, and in excluding such evidence pursuant to section 8, or 10(b)."
d_2013skca10.txt,"The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the Court declared him a long-term offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. The defendant appealed from this sentence. He argued that during the dangerous offender hearing the judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of the two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long term offender instead of a dangerous offender. For the reasons that follow, I dismiss the appeal. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The trial judge instructed himself properly on the law and noted the appropriate authorities in order to decide the contested issue, namely the third point in s. 753.1(1) of the Criminal Code: whether there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of risk in the community. 2) The evidence established that the defendant vacillated between three positions involving the sexual offences. The Court assumed that the statements made by the defendant when asked about his commission of the sexual assaults were true and second, that he was genuine when he stated he wanted to change. 3) The defendant did not testify at the hearing. The opinions of the experts were premised upon two assumptions. The first being that he assumed the reports of the defendant's good behaviour on remand were true; the second was that he would never have to participate in sexual offender treatment if he never had the chance to participate. Both experts acknowledged that the finding that the particular individual is dangerous offender should only be made if an indeterminedate sentence is the least restrictive means by which to reduce the public threat posed by the offender to an acceptable level. 4) In addition to the four predicate offences that led to the defendant being classified dangerous offender, the defendant has been in custody since June 2005 for four degrading sexual assaults upon vulnerable women and has yet to take the high intensity sexual offender program which the experts acknowledge is pre-requisite for rehabilitation. Since the experts had identified the defendant as a pathological liar, this trust appears to have been misplaced."
d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","The plaintiff union and its representatives republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The union and the Hospital both appealed. Appeal allowed; general damages of $100,000 fixed at $25,000; the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements are protected by qualified privilege. The fact that the words in the grievance had been posted at the hospital and on the Union's website suggest that the republishing of the grievance undermined the plaintiff's authority and caused him to believe that his staff had lost respect for him. The plaintiff intended to return to work, but was forced to take a position in the veterinary faculty hospital where she experienced renewed personal harassment. She sought to retain her position as a faculty member and sought to increase her employment. The court reviewed the history of labour relations and found that most of the statements in this case had been published in part on the union's website. It is now a reality that the internet and web pages will be used by large organizations (such as the Union) to communicate with its membership. The trial judge found that the Union rarely operated in the manner that it did here. In addition, the grievance document attached to the Original Grievance for the plaintiff no longer enjoyed that protection once the document was published in such a broad way and for the purposes stated in the trial decision. In this case, the plaintiff alleged that she was being harassed by the union members and that her termination of employment would result in a loss of her employment and reputation. She also sought damages for lost wages, loss of pension, and loss of opportunity to obtain equivalent position in another university. Awarding damages to the union for failing to find that the statements were entirely unfounded and without substance, that there was no basis by which a trial judge could have concluded that the plaintiff had in fact been defamed by the publication of the allegations against him. There was no palpable and overriding error by finding that the defamation statute did not apply."
d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff has applied to the Court seeking orders that the defendants, Clarke Transport and Clarke Transport Inc. (Clarke) answer certain questions which they refused to answer on discovery. The application raises interesting issues with respect to the proper scope of questioning and examination for discovery. HELD: 1) The Court found that when the Court moved from the words of touching and relating to any matter in issue, it intended to move away from the broad relevance test that existed under the former Queen's Bench Rules. 2) It is clear that the insurance adjuster's file would be subject to a litigation privilege. The history of some 445 cars previously loaded by Clarke is not pled as an issue in the action. It is not reasonable for the Court to order the plaintiff to answer questions which it would have preferred to have answered on its own. 3) There is no evidence that the implied waiver should be narrowly construed and the privilege should be maintained where it is fair to do so, and for proportionality reasons Clarke should not be required to answer the question. Putting Clarke to the time, effort and expense of seeking answers to questions which the defendants say are best left to be answered on completion of their discovery of the plaintiff, when they will have better information, is not an appropriate response. The approach taken here is premature and unnecessary since it is entirely up to the defendant to decide whether to accommodate the plaintiff. The plaintiff is obliged to answer based upon its current knowledge of the situation. 4) The plaintiff cannot without significant work that would essentially involve auditing CN's entire claimed expense records, possibly know whether or not the items claimed flowed from the derailment. All of the relevant knowledge is in the possession of CN, and Clarke would have had no basis on which to make informed decisions. 5) The request for an undertaking to search its own records and advise whether each of a group of individuals identified by CN as previously loaded as Clarke had in fact been loaded by the plaintiff is inappropriate. It would be inappropriate for the court to order Clarke to answer only after the completion of the now scheduled continuation of discovery.  6) The application is dismissed with costs of $1,500 to the cause."
d_2014skpc145.txt,"The Court allowed the application in part. It struck the portion of the claim with respect to damages from debris falling from the defendants’ tree. Even if proven, the damages were part of urban life. The plaintiff claimed for injunctive relief ordering the trees to be removed. The Court had no jurisdiction to grant this relief. The amended claim could proceed limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees into the plaintiff’s property and whether the trees invaded the plaintiff’s air space.","The parties were self-represented at a case management conference. At that time the Sykes indicated they were going to be making an application to have portions of the action struck. The plaintiff amended claim to claim damages from overhanging trees on their property. The amended claim was successful and the parties were allowed to self-represent. HELD: The portion of the plaintiff's amended claim that was struck was allowed to proceed. The court held that an injunction ordering the trees to be removed was 'beyond the authority of this Court.' It was not necessary for the plaintiff to prove the damage to the property was caused by the trees, but it was clearly a remedy this Court had no jurisdiction to grant. The application for an injunction was struck as frivolous and vexatious. Even if the plaintiff could prove that the debris in his yard was solely from Sykes' trees, this would not be sufficient to strike the claim."
e_1991canlii4217.txt,"The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act. The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","Continental Seafoods applied for a refund of health services tax paid on refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring. This product was mainly to be supplied on contract to the Soviet Union. The contract contained stringent quality specifications, including a phase where the pickling occurs in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to ‑2ºC. The use of a cold room in the process performed a function that was part of the manufacture or production of the product. The appellant argued that the provincial tax commission was incorrect in not allowing the exemption for the refrigeration unit in full. In issue was whether the tax should be refunded or not. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the assessment for health services taxed was upheld. 1)In light of the new legislation, it is appropriate to raise a new point of law in the context of s.19 of the Health Services Tax Act.  2)The Provincial Tax Commissioner's decision not to apportion the tax paid was not appropriate in circumstances where fairness could not be ensured. 3)The claim for refund was not properly advanced at the stage of the proceeding."

When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital. As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code.

The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by Lorne Putnam's company. The three brothers each formed a new company at that time with Gene owning the dairy farm and Merle owning the trailer park and gravel pit operation. The plan was to incorporate new company called 'Geneco.' Gene Putnam died in 1982 and after his death, the three brothers continued to operate the company. They all worked in different aspects of the company and eventually became involved in the management of the dairy operation. Gene putnam sold Fluid Milk Quota (maintaining the value of the farm on a going concern basis) to his brother. The defendant sold it and took the position that it was not obligated to share the proceeds with the plaintiffs. The plaintiff obtained a copy of the documents signed by the defendants. The documents show that the agreement was signed in 1987 and included conditions precedent to the new quota system. The agreement provided that each brother would have the right to have his share of the sale of each quota. In the years since 1987 the evidence establishes that these two quotas separated in that it became possible to sell only MSQ. The defendants sold MSQ and the plaintiff received a portion of that proceeds. The plaintiffs sought to have the agreement interpreted as meaning that if the defendant sold any of the milk quota which it held in 1987 prior to December 3lst, 2003, it was obligated to divide the proceeds three ways. For easy reference, intend to refer to the brothers by name instead of by their respective company name. MACLELLAN, J.: The dispute in this case is about how to interpret an agreement signed by three brothers in 1988 by which they reorganized their father's farming operation. It is the dispute that defines how the agreement should be interpreted to mean that the defendants sold all of the assets in the company which were to be retained by the parent company and not all quota sold. In this case, the plaintiffs are alleging the agreement only refers to Fluid milk Quota and therefore the agreement is not binding. The agreements clearly state that the two assets are to be equally divided and therefore there is no obligation for the plaintiff to have any part of that assets sold. This agreement is therefore not binding on the plaintiff. In fact, it is an agreement that the parties agreed upon prior to the merger that the assets would be divided equally among them.

e_1999skqb151.txt,"The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","The issue was whether the Agreement was a lease or a security agreement. The dealer and the owner entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' of $9,320.67 and the final 'termination value' payment of $23,650 to be paid at the owner's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The evidence was clear that the parties treated the trade-in as the advance payment even though the value of the trade in did not equal the amount of the advance Payment. The difference being $679.33 (between $10,000.00 and $8,310.67).HELD: The claim was dismissed. The defendant was awarded costs on the basis of Column D of the Tariff of Costs. 1)The Agreement had many of the attributes of ownership and collectively show that the owner acquired a substantial interest in the sprayers. The Agreement is a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the owner elected to pay the final payment.  2)The Court must be able to ascertain the probable value at the end of the Agreement in June 2002 and in light of the evidence that it depends on market fluctuations, cannot determine whether the value would depend upon market fluctuations. To validate the early repossession in these circumstances would defeat the intention of the legislation to afford protection to farmers against loss of property interests without compliance with legislative provisions by creditors who are governed by the Act. It would be unjust to make any further order under the Act in the circumstances and in the absence of an evidentiary basis, for example, of the fair market value at time of the seizure as required for an order under s.55(c) of the Act or in any event at all."

e_2005skqb263.txt,"Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","The Crown sought to admit the two previous incidents of choking as similar fact evidence to prove issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm, sexual assault and threatening to kill after she confronted her husband with whom she had previously been. She also alleged that she was choked by her husband after he confronted her as to where, and with whom, she had been. At issue was whether the Crown bar to the admissibility of the statements made by the accused concerning the charges of October 17, 2003 and November 3, 2003; whether hearsay evidence should be admitted as an exception to the presumptive inadmissible admissiblilty of the same fact evidence; and whether the hearsay statements made to her friends, family and co-workers admissible under the principled approach. HELD: 1) The Court held there must, at least, be some evidence capable of reasonably supporting finding that the appellant was implicated in the other similar acts committed by the same person. 2) The evidence falling within an otherwise valid exception was not tainted with collusion. There was a serious potential for moral prejudice based on the existence of corroborating or conflicting evidence. 3) Hearsay evidence is presumptively admissible, without the need for a voir dire, if it falls under an established exception to a hearsay rule. There is a great risk of reasoning prejudice by admitting the similar facts evidence as it may distract members of the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. However, the possibility that the accused will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required to be convicted of murder is unlikely. 4) It was clear that the two previously incidents were extremely prejudicial in nature which created a serious onus on the trial judge to determine whether the evidence was sufficiently similar to adduce the evidence."
e_2007skqb225.txt,"The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived. The appeal is made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The imposition of a victim fine surcharge under s. 737 of the code is mandatory subject only to an application under s. 737(5) relating to undue hardship. If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharge, it is also mandatory that the Court give reasons. The sentence is varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30.","The Crown appealed the sentence of the respondent for failing or refusing, without reasonable excuse, to attend and complete an anger management program as required by a probation order made September 14, 2005. Sentencing was adjourned to March 5, 2007 to allow a pre-sentence report to be prepared. The sentencing judge waived the victim surcharge. HELD: The sentence was varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharges in the amount of $30. The surcharge was waived notwithstanding that the respondent had not requested an exemption pursuant to s. 737(5) of the Code. The Crown gave reasons for the reduction in the sentence. 1)The sentencing judge failed to meet the maximum sentence imposed by the Criminal Code. He was employed by the Crown and consistently raised the maximum amount of surcharges by the court. His sentencing decision was so important to the entire criminal justice system that it was not necessary to give reasons for his decision. 2)An offender who is convicted or discharged under section 730 of an offence under this Act or the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act or who is in a position to self-inspect, is exempted. 3)The maximum surcharge of 15 per cent is applicable in circumstances where there is undue hardship. This is particularly true where the sentencing judge has raised an amount of money that is not paid in accordance with the statutory maximum surcharges and because the entire system of criminal justice is geared to such an enormous amount of financial hardship on the part of the offender. This type of surcharge represents an important and important breach of the maximum imposed surcharge under the Code in all circumstances."
e_2007skqb367.txt,"The plaintiff is an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Union. He commenced this claim based on the Indemnity Clause contained in the Union's bylaws. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","The plaintiff, an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Saskatoon Civic Employees' Union, commenced this action under the simplified procedure of Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules seeking judgment for $50,000. The plaintiff's claim is grounded on a provision of the Union's by-laws which reads: 12.1 a) Defending an action or proceeding against Union officer claiming liability on the part of that Union officer for acts or omissions done by the Union officer in the course of his/her duties or paying any sum required to settle the action; b) Damages and costs awarded against union officer as result of the finding of liability pursuant to the indemnity by-law; and c) Exhausting internal remedies. The dispute in the Fourth Action involves a contractual debate concerning the meaning and scope of an indemnity clause. This is substantially different from an internecine dispute in a voluntary sports organization respecting the disciplining of high school coach over recruiting practices. In short, this is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen’s Bench Court. Accordingly, the Court has jurisdiction to entertain the claim and its application under Rule 485 for summary judgment. Exhausted internal remedies The plaintiff had been unsuccessful in his first two internal Union appeals. He now applied under Queen”s Bench rule 485 (summary judgment), which provides the court with an exclusive domain on industrial relations. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The Court held that it would be inappropriate to prevent the plaintiff from bringing this application in the absence of a clear and enforceable provision excluding his access to the Courts. 2) In this case, the plaintiff utilizes a number of interpretive twists and turns. Much was said and written by all the players to the drama which gave rise to the current litigation strategy employed by the plaintiff. It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff is engaged in litigation respecting the Union, not CUPE National's. Nothing in the Union by-laws precludes him from seeking relief from the Courts before making a final appeal to the National office. 3) The dispute is squarely within the context of the union’ s. 4, the essential nature of the contractual relationship between the union and its members, the principles of natural justice, and the laws of the trade union. 4) The plaintiff was awarded costs of the first two actions. 5) In the fourth action he was awarded $50"
e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","The parties were married for 37 years and had two children. The respondent applied to vary the period of retroactive child support based on the evidence of the petitioner and the respondent's mother. The petitioner argued that although the parties' corollary relief judgment provided for a shared parenting arrangement and equal sharing of all special and extraordinary expenses, the court did not have jurisdiction to grant retroactive support for the older child because the petitioner was not, at the time of the application, a child of the marriage. The younger child clearly left the charge of his parents in April 2008 and established an independent household without the consent, agreement, approval or financial support of the parties. He did not seek any of these from his parents when doing so. The evidence established that the respondent and his girlfriend took up residence in a downtown Toronto apartment in 2008. HELD: 1)The respondent's application to vary was retroactive to July 2004. This is also the year when the respondent gave notice of his intention to seek an increase in support. 2)The trial judge did not allow the petitioner's mother's costs claim. 3)The court had jurisdiction to consider the application of the respondent for retroactive variation of child support and a readjustment of the claim for section 7 expenses pertaining to her older child. 4)The issues raised by the petitioner were determined primarily to jurisdiction and not the result of the result. The court was not precluded from ruling on the merits of the applicant's claim. 5)The petitioner's conduct was speculative and conjecture. However, it was found to be within the court's jurisdiction to make a retroactive order for an adult child and was not relevant to the cause of this application.  6)The parties agreed the respondent had contributed to his/her child's support in a way that satisfied his or her obligation, and therefore no retroactive award should be ordered."
e_2009skca138.txt,"This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed.","The company's assessment for municipal tax purposes of a shopping mall was based on a single agreement featuring a single sale price. The assessment was allowed in part but the company applied to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal on several grounds alleging error of law. The company's argument that the Committee erred in law in failing to give effect to the fact the City Assessor did not 'determine the sale price' of the property by the sale of the three shopping malls as required by the Assessment Manual, but by using the sale verification information to the exclusion of other relevant information. The Committee did not find any material error on the part of the Committee. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Contrary to the claims made by the Committee, the assessment was not based solely on the Committee's determination of the fair value of the building and, more importantly, on the evidence of the parties to the transaction. It was in reliance upon s. 171 and 172 of The Cities Act. The importance lies in the fact municipal assessors are highly dependent on the information at his command, including the information supplied to him by the parties. 2) The Committee failed to observe that the sale, contrary to what the Committee made of it, did not amount to an arm's length sale because the Assessor was not a 'willing, unrestricted, unrelated and knowledgeable' buyer. It could not have purchased an interest in the Toronto and Winnipeg shopping malls without the assistance of the Ontario Teachers Pension Fund (ONT) and were required to retain the services of the former owners as managers. 3) The sale price satisfied the remaining criteria of s. 3(c) and (d) of the assessment. The sale was of considerable importance to the assessment and, in the general proposition that if the sale can be ascertained and verified by an assessor then the sales price can be used for the purposes of determining an appropriate market adjustment factor by the sales comparison method."

The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18 years of age. The defendant applies for leave to cross-examine the representative plaintiff on his affidavit pursuant to Rule 317 of The Queen's Bench Rules.

None support the proposition that proposed representative plaintiff is immune from cross-examination in respect of his or her individual claim. Cross-examination of proposed representative plaintiff may explore matters pertaining to his or her individual claim in the context of issue that must be determined by the court pursuant to s. and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act.

The plaintiff sued for payment of the outstanding account HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The Court found enough evidence to conclude that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that there was a breach of the implied condition that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard. As the plaintiff's workmanship constitutes a breach of contract, the defendant's damages are set off against the claim.","HELD: The action was set down for summary trial with no examinations for discovery or pre-trial conference. The plaintiff was entitled to damages. The issue before the court was whether the plaintiff was liable to pay the builder's lien under The Builders' Lien Act. The court found that the plaintiff's workmanship was not achieved and that, therefore, there had been a breach of the implied condition of the contract that it would be performed in a 'workmanlike standard'. The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The cost of repair was $2,800.00 with interest to date of judgment and $1,785.00 to the defendant. The defendant was awarded general damages of $3,000.00.

e_2012skca69.txt,"The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed.","The respondent applies for judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. The respondent is a Roma and Romanian national who has resided in Canada since his arrival here exactly eight years ago. Romania seeks the respondent's extradition from Canada so that he might serve a three-year prison sentence imposed as a result of his conviction, in that country, for criminally negligent homicide (an offence equivalent to that of manslaughter in Canada). The respondent states that he has family and long-term employment in the jurisdiction. He will put up his Mercedes Benz C230 vehicle as collateral to be forfeited if he fails to surrender to authorities. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The respondent has met the low threshold of non-appearance that is necessary to avoid extradition to Romania. It is not the Court's place to look behind the applicant's refugee status and the fact that he failed to abide by his community-based sentence and has not satisfied the compensation judgment awarded against him.  2) Romania's characterisation in this respect must be qualified and properly left to the Minister under s. 40 of the criminal code.  3) The Court's conclusion that the respondent has failed to meet this low threshold is not supported by Romania's submission that his s. 43(3)(b) submission to the Court was frivolous. 4) In light of the committal order, the failure of the respondent to proffer satisfactory evidence to overcome the heightened risk of his non- reappearance more severely than the Court would do in an application for a direct judicial release of an offender made under ss. 7, 515 and 679 (the Criminal Code) does not stand in favour of an application by an offender who has been extradited from his home country. 5) The sureties proffered by the respondent are his common law spouse and member of the Romanian community in Saskatoon. He has no real property and Romania views the potential forfeiture of his vehicle as being of little assurance that he will surrender himself into custody.  6) The petitioner's application for interim judicial release is dismissed with costs."

During his employment as professional truck driver, the accused had driven into construction zone on highway and hit another vehicle that had been stopped. The three teenage occupants of the vehicle were killed and flag person was severely injured as result of the collision. The accused was sure that he had not been asleep at the time of the accident but felt that he had not been paying attention. He had not noticed any of the signs posted at 100-metre intervals after the start of the construction zone 1.6 km south of the accident. The accused was 41 years of age. He had obtained his A-1 driver’s licence in 2009 and had clean driving abstract. He was married and had three children. He had recently been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. He expressed remorse to the victim’s families and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.| HELD: The accused was sentenced to three years in imprisonment on the first count and three years concurrent for the second and third counts, and one year concurrent to the other counts on the fourth count. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment. The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone. The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse. He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record. The accused was at low risk to re-offend.","The accused was charged with three counts of dangerous driving, one of which related to his failure to recognize stopped vehicles in an active construction zone. The accused was convicted of operating a motor vehicle in a manner that was dangerous to the public and caused the death of three young boys. The impact on the three boys was so severe that one of the boys, who was standing near the driver's side of the vehicle, suffered a broken collarbone, a broken left collarbone and a fractured left clavicle. He also suffered short-term and long-term memory loss. The injuries sustained by the driver were the same. The defendant admitted to operating the vehicle in an undiagnosed manner and apologized to the victims, but stated that he did not know the stopped vehicles were in the construction zone and that he had no previous driving offences. HELD: The Court held that the defendant was guilty of all of the offences under s. 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code, including driving with more than 80 mgs of alcohol in his blood and driving with a blood alcohol concentration greater than.08. The aggravating and mitigating factors as outlined in s. 253(b) and s. 259(2) were appropriate. The totality principle must also be applied by the Court in determining what the ultimate sentence should be for the accused.  1) The Court was totally satisfied that it had sufficiently heard from the victims in this matter. That was accomplished during the sentencing hearing when the family members, friends and relatives gave their victim impact statements. 2) The defendant's unlawful conduct was found to be in addition to the driving prohibition and driving prohibition.  3) There was no suggestion whatsoever that alcohol and/or drugs were involved in the offence. The fundamental principle of sentence being proportionate to the gravity of the offence, as well as the degree of responsibility of the offender, must be considered by the court in sentencing the defendant. The additional sentencing principles (Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679, [SCC], and similar sentencing principles) were considered. To the greatest extent possible, parity must be accomplished considering other sentences imposed for individuals convicted of dangerous driver causing death and causing bodily harm. This is an intricate process that must be crafted with great care by the sentencing judge. The Court awarded the offender a sentence of six years in federal institution and ordered him to pay a victim surcharge of $800 to be served consecutively to the six-year sentence.  4) The sentences were to be concurrent with the"
